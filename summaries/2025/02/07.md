# Activity Summary for 2/7/2025

## 12:27:48 PM
The log shows the iterative development of a `PasswordSecurityScanner` class in C++.  The key changes across multiple `.hpp` and `.cpp` files span from February 7th, 2025, 11:51 AM to 12:26 PM.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.hpp`**: This header file defines the `PasswordSecurityScanner` class.  Initial versions (11:51 AM and 11:58 AM) had a placeholder `getAlarmStatus()` method and several methods marked as `TODO` for later merging of branches. The major change happened between 12:01 PM and 12:13 PM, where  `setScanTimer` and `setShadowFilePath` methods were added to allow for external configuration of the scanner. Finally, at 12:13 PM,  `writeDefaultPasswordAlarmStatus` was changed from `private` to `protected` and the placeholder `placeholderAlarmStatus` member was removed.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp`**: This source file implements the `PasswordSecurityScanner` class.  Several revisions occurred between 11:53 AM and 12:26 PM.  Early versions (11:53 AM, 11:56 AM, 11:57 AM)  contained placeholders for writing the alarm status to the state.  These were gradually replaced with a fully functional `writeDefaultPasswordAlarmStatus` implementation that utilizes `dolly::toJson` for JSON serialization.  A notable change between 12:00 PM and 12:01 PM involved adding `setScanTimer` and `setShadowFilePath` methods, reflecting changes in the header file. Between 12:01 PM and 12:26 PM the constructor was significantly changed to remove the  `_scanTimer` and `_shadowFilePath` parameters and initialized them within the class with default values.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner.hpp`**: This file creates a test harness for the `PasswordSecurityScanner`. The  key changes (12:08 PM, 12:09 PM, 12:10 PM, 12:12 PM, 12:16 PM, 12:18 PM) center around refining the class definition to include a complete copy constructor, move constructor, assignment operator implementations, and  a `getAlarmStatus` method mirroring the one in the main class to allow for test verification. The final version (12:18 PM) shows a fully functional TestHarness class, with a public `getAlarmStatus()` method returning `placeholderAlarmStatus`.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/PasswordSecurityScannerTest.cpp`**: This file contains unit tests for the `PasswordSecurityScanner`. The most significant change (12:15 PM) was correcting the instantiation of `pPasswordSecurityScanner` in the `SetUp` method to use the `TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner` class properly.  The tests themselves cover various scenarios, including empty shadow files, files with non-SHA512 passwords, files with incorrectly formatted SHA512 passwords, files without target users, and files with various combinations of default password violations.  The tests extensively use `dolly::parseJson` for JSON comparison.


The overall pattern reveals a progression from an initial, incomplete implementation to a fully tested and functional password security scanner.  The use of `dolly::dynamic` and `dolly::toJson` suggests the use of a JSON-based data structure for representing and storing alarm status.  The frequent updates to the `.cpp` file indicate a focus on implementing and refining the core logic of the scanner while the header file updates reflects changes in the scanner's functionality and API, mostly focused on allowing external configuration.  The test suite comprehensively covers various failure modes and edge cases, ensuring robustness.
