# Activity Summary for 2/7/2025

## 12:27:48 PM
The log shows the iterative development of a `PasswordSecurityScanner` class in C++.  The key changes across multiple `.hpp` and `.cpp` files span from February 7th, 2025, 11:51 AM to 12:26 PM.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.hpp`**: This header file defines the `PasswordSecurityScanner` class.  Initial versions (11:51 AM and 11:58 AM) had a placeholder `getAlarmStatus()` method and several methods marked as `TODO` for later merging of branches. The major change happened between 12:01 PM and 12:13 PM, where  `setScanTimer` and `setShadowFilePath` methods were added to allow for external configuration of the scanner. Finally, at 12:13 PM,  `writeDefaultPasswordAlarmStatus` was changed from `private` to `protected` and the placeholder `placeholderAlarmStatus` member was removed.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp`**: This source file implements the `PasswordSecurityScanner` class.  Several revisions occurred between 11:53 AM and 12:26 PM.  Early versions (11:53 AM, 11:56 AM, 11:57 AM)  contained placeholders for writing the alarm status to the state.  These were gradually replaced with a fully functional `writeDefaultPasswordAlarmStatus` implementation that utilizes `dolly::toJson` for JSON serialization.  A notable change between 12:00 PM and 12:01 PM involved adding `setScanTimer` and `setShadowFilePath` methods, reflecting changes in the header file. Between 12:01 PM and 12:26 PM the constructor was significantly changed to remove the  `_scanTimer` and `_shadowFilePath` parameters and initialized them within the class with default values.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner.hpp`**: This file creates a test harness for the `PasswordSecurityScanner`. The  key changes (12:08 PM, 12:09 PM, 12:10 PM, 12:12 PM, 12:16 PM, 12:18 PM) center around refining the class definition to include a complete copy constructor, move constructor, assignment operator implementations, and  a `getAlarmStatus` method mirroring the one in the main class to allow for test verification. The final version (12:18 PM) shows a fully functional TestHarness class, with a public `getAlarmStatus()` method returning `placeholderAlarmStatus`.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/PasswordSecurityScannerTest.cpp`**: This file contains unit tests for the `PasswordSecurityScanner`. The most significant change (12:15 PM) was correcting the instantiation of `pPasswordSecurityScanner` in the `SetUp` method to use the `TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner` class properly.  The tests themselves cover various scenarios, including empty shadow files, files with non-SHA512 passwords, files with incorrectly formatted SHA512 passwords, files without target users, and files with various combinations of default password violations.  The tests extensively use `dolly::parseJson` for JSON comparison.


The overall pattern reveals a progression from an initial, incomplete implementation to a fully tested and functional password security scanner.  The use of `dolly::dynamic` and `dolly::toJson` suggests the use of a JSON-based data structure for representing and storing alarm status.  The frequent updates to the `.cpp` file indicate a focus on implementing and refining the core logic of the scanner while the header file updates reflects changes in the scanner's functionality and API, mostly focused on allowing external configuration.  The test suite comprehensively covers various failure modes and edge cases, ensuring robustness.


## 3:27:53 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.hpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp` between 2:27 PM and 3:25 PM on February 7, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be integrating a `PasswordSecurityScanner` component into the `NodeMonitor` class.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.hpp` Changes:**

*   **Initial state (2:27 PM):** The header file defines the `NodeMonitor` and `NodeMonitorServiceAgent` classes, which handle various system monitoring tasks (CPU, memory, disk, NTP).  Many included header files suggest a reliance on various libraries and internal modules.
*   **Addition of `PasswordSecurityScanner.hpp` (2:28 PM and 2:29 PM):** The `PasswordSecurityScanner.hpp` header file is added to the includes, indicating the start of the integration process. The `NodeMonitor` constructor is modified to accept a `stl::fit_shared_ptr<TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner>` as a parameter.
*   **Refactoring of Password Security Scanner (2:33 PM):** The `NodeMonitor` constructor changes to accept a `PasswordSecurityScannerPtr` (a type alias for `stl::fit_shared_ptr<password_scanner::PasswordSecurityScanner>`). This suggests a move towards using a more general `PasswordSecurityScanner` class from a `password_scanner` namespace.
*   **Default Password Security Scanner Added (2:35 PM, 2:36 PM, 2:41 PM, 2:42 PM):**  A default `PasswordSecurityScannerPtr` is added as a static member. The constructor is also updated to allow for using the default `PasswordSecurityScanner`. This change improves the flexibility of the code by providing a default value for this parameter, which was previously only optional. The default path for synchronized directories is also moved to be a static const member variable.
*   **Namespace Clarification (2:52 PM):** The `PasswordSecurityScannerPtr` type alias is updated to use the fully qualified namespace  `node_monitor::password_scanner::PasswordSecurityScanner`.  This improves code clarity and avoids potential naming conflicts.
*   **Addition of `initializePasswordSecurityScanner()` (2:59 PM onwards):** A new method `initializePasswordSecurityScanner` is added to the `NodeMonitor` class, suggesting that the password scanner's initialization is now handled separately.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp` Changes:**

*   **Initial state (2:45 PM):**  The source file contains implementations for the `NodeMonitor` class's member functions. The code shows extensive system monitoring logic, particularly focusing on CPU, memory, and disk utilization.  Error and logging mechanisms are also present.
*   **`PasswordSecurityScannerPtr` added to the constructor (2:49 PM, 2:50 PM):** The constructor is updated to include `_pPasswordSecurityScanner`  as a parameter and assigns this parameter to a class member.
*   **Addition of `initializePasswordSecurityScanner()` (2:59 PM, 3:00 PM):** An `initializePasswordSecurityScanner` method is implemented.  If a security scanner pointer is not already assigned, a new `PasswordSecurityScanner` object is created and started. The object is created using the `getNodeName` and `getStatefulObjects` functions, confirming that it is intended to scan passwords based on the system's state.
*   **`stateObjects`  is used instead of `getStatefulObjects()` in `initializePasswordSecurityScanner` (3:17 PM):** The `getStatefulObjects` function is removed and it's replaced with the `stateObjects` member in the creation of the `PasswordSecurityScanner`.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessNodeMonitor.hpp` Changes:**

*   **Evolution of Test Harness (3:05 PM - 3:25 PM):** This file, containing a test harness for `NodeMonitor`, underwent several changes, primarily related to the `PasswordSecurityScanner`. There is a change in the `dummyStateObjects`  from a `pattern::StateSafe` to a `pattern::StackSafe`. The constructor and the way the `TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner` is initialized also underwent modifications.  The overall goal seems to be to ensure proper setup of the password security scanner during testing.

**Overall Summary:**

The code changes focus on cleanly integrating a password security scanner into the NodeMonitor application.  This was accomplished by adding a new `PasswordSecurityScannerPtr` parameter and an `initializePasswordSecurityScanner()` method, improving code organization and maintainability.  The testing harness also underwent changes to adapt to these modifications. The changes were spread out across several commits with minor adjustments made in subsequent commits to perfect the code.
