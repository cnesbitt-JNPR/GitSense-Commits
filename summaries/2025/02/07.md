# Activity Summary for 2/7/2025

## 12:27:48 PM
The log shows the iterative development of a `PasswordSecurityScanner` class in C++.  The key changes across multiple `.hpp` and `.cpp` files span from February 7th, 2025, 11:51 AM to 12:26 PM.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.hpp`**: This header file defines the `PasswordSecurityScanner` class.  Initial versions (11:51 AM and 11:58 AM) had a placeholder `getAlarmStatus()` method and several methods marked as `TODO` for later merging of branches. The major change happened between 12:01 PM and 12:13 PM, where  `setScanTimer` and `setShadowFilePath` methods were added to allow for external configuration of the scanner. Finally, at 12:13 PM,  `writeDefaultPasswordAlarmStatus` was changed from `private` to `protected` and the placeholder `placeholderAlarmStatus` member was removed.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp`**: This source file implements the `PasswordSecurityScanner` class.  Several revisions occurred between 11:53 AM and 12:26 PM.  Early versions (11:53 AM, 11:56 AM, 11:57 AM)  contained placeholders for writing the alarm status to the state.  These were gradually replaced with a fully functional `writeDefaultPasswordAlarmStatus` implementation that utilizes `dolly::toJson` for JSON serialization.  A notable change between 12:00 PM and 12:01 PM involved adding `setScanTimer` and `setShadowFilePath` methods, reflecting changes in the header file. Between 12:01 PM and 12:26 PM the constructor was significantly changed to remove the  `_scanTimer` and `_shadowFilePath` parameters and initialized them within the class with default values.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner.hpp`**: This file creates a test harness for the `PasswordSecurityScanner`. The  key changes (12:08 PM, 12:09 PM, 12:10 PM, 12:12 PM, 12:16 PM, 12:18 PM) center around refining the class definition to include a complete copy constructor, move constructor, assignment operator implementations, and  a `getAlarmStatus` method mirroring the one in the main class to allow for test verification. The final version (12:18 PM) shows a fully functional TestHarness class, with a public `getAlarmStatus()` method returning `placeholderAlarmStatus`.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/PasswordSecurityScannerTest.cpp`**: This file contains unit tests for the `PasswordSecurityScanner`. The most significant change (12:15 PM) was correcting the instantiation of `pPasswordSecurityScanner` in the `SetUp` method to use the `TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner` class properly.  The tests themselves cover various scenarios, including empty shadow files, files with non-SHA512 passwords, files with incorrectly formatted SHA512 passwords, files without target users, and files with various combinations of default password violations.  The tests extensively use `dolly::parseJson` for JSON comparison.


The overall pattern reveals a progression from an initial, incomplete implementation to a fully tested and functional password security scanner.  The use of `dolly::dynamic` and `dolly::toJson` suggests the use of a JSON-based data structure for representing and storing alarm status.  The frequent updates to the `.cpp` file indicate a focus on implementing and refining the core logic of the scanner while the header file updates reflects changes in the scanner's functionality and API, mostly focused on allowing external configuration.  The test suite comprehensively covers various failure modes and edge cases, ensuring robustness.


## 3:27:53 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.hpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp` between 2:27 PM and 3:25 PM on February 7, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be integrating a `PasswordSecurityScanner` component into the `NodeMonitor` class.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.hpp` Changes:**

*   **Initial state (2:27 PM):** The header file defines the `NodeMonitor` and `NodeMonitorServiceAgent` classes, which handle various system monitoring tasks (CPU, memory, disk, NTP).  Many included header files suggest a reliance on various libraries and internal modules.
*   **Addition of `PasswordSecurityScanner.hpp` (2:28 PM and 2:29 PM):** The `PasswordSecurityScanner.hpp` header file is added to the includes, indicating the start of the integration process. The `NodeMonitor` constructor is modified to accept a `stl::fit_shared_ptr<TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner>` as a parameter.
*   **Refactoring of Password Security Scanner (2:33 PM):** The `NodeMonitor` constructor changes to accept a `PasswordSecurityScannerPtr` (a type alias for `stl::fit_shared_ptr<password_scanner::PasswordSecurityScanner>`). This suggests a move towards using a more general `PasswordSecurityScanner` class from a `password_scanner` namespace.
*   **Default Password Security Scanner Added (2:35 PM, 2:36 PM, 2:41 PM, 2:42 PM):**  A default `PasswordSecurityScannerPtr` is added as a static member. The constructor is also updated to allow for using the default `PasswordSecurityScanner`. This change improves the flexibility of the code by providing a default value for this parameter, which was previously only optional. The default path for synchronized directories is also moved to be a static const member variable.
*   **Namespace Clarification (2:52 PM):** The `PasswordSecurityScannerPtr` type alias is updated to use the fully qualified namespace  `node_monitor::password_scanner::PasswordSecurityScanner`.  This improves code clarity and avoids potential naming conflicts.
*   **Addition of `initializePasswordSecurityScanner()` (2:59 PM onwards):** A new method `initializePasswordSecurityScanner` is added to the `NodeMonitor` class, suggesting that the password scanner's initialization is now handled separately.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp` Changes:**

*   **Initial state (2:45 PM):**  The source file contains implementations for the `NodeMonitor` class's member functions. The code shows extensive system monitoring logic, particularly focusing on CPU, memory, and disk utilization.  Error and logging mechanisms are also present.
*   **`PasswordSecurityScannerPtr` added to the constructor (2:49 PM, 2:50 PM):** The constructor is updated to include `_pPasswordSecurityScanner`  as a parameter and assigns this parameter to a class member.
*   **Addition of `initializePasswordSecurityScanner()` (2:59 PM, 3:00 PM):** An `initializePasswordSecurityScanner` method is implemented.  If a security scanner pointer is not already assigned, a new `PasswordSecurityScanner` object is created and started. The object is created using the `getNodeName` and `getStatefulObjects` functions, confirming that it is intended to scan passwords based on the system's state.
*   **`stateObjects`  is used instead of `getStatefulObjects()` in `initializePasswordSecurityScanner` (3:17 PM):** The `getStatefulObjects` function is removed and it's replaced with the `stateObjects` member in the creation of the `PasswordSecurityScanner`.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessNodeMonitor.hpp` Changes:**

*   **Evolution of Test Harness (3:05 PM - 3:25 PM):** This file, containing a test harness for `NodeMonitor`, underwent several changes, primarily related to the `PasswordSecurityScanner`. There is a change in the `dummyStateObjects`  from a `pattern::StateSafe` to a `pattern::StackSafe`. The constructor and the way the `TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner` is initialized also underwent modifications.  The overall goal seems to be to ensure proper setup of the password security scanner during testing.

**Overall Summary:**

The code changes focus on cleanly integrating a password security scanner into the NodeMonitor application.  This was accomplished by adding a new `PasswordSecurityScannerPtr` parameter and an `initializePasswordSecurityScanner()` method, improving code organization and maintainability.  The testing harness also underwent changes to adapt to these modifications. The changes were spread out across several commits with minor adjustments made in subsequent commits to perfect the code.


## 4:28:49 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner.hpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` files between 3:27 PM and 4:20 PM on February 7th, 2025.  These changes primarily focus on the implementation of the `TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner` class, a test harness for the `PasswordSecurityScanner`.

Initially, the header file (`TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner.hpp`) lacked a `createTestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner` function.  Over several edits, this function was added, its parameters refined (removing unnecessary parameters and adding a default shadow file path `/tmp/etc/shadow`), and its implementation altered to use static members `dummyNodeName` and `dummyStateObjects` for instantiation.  The final version of the function is named `createDummyScanner` and uses the static member variables directly.


The corresponding `.cpp` file (`TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner.cpp`) underwent similar changes. The `createDummyScanner` function was moved inside the `password_scanner_test` namespace, initially without the namespace declaration and then later correctly added. The definition of the static members (`dummyNodeName` and `dummyStateObjects`)  were moved from the header file to the `.cpp` file in a final refactoring step to improve encapsulation, and the implementation of several methods initially present in the header file was moved to the source file.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessNodeMonitor.hpp` file was also modified between 3:32 PM and 3:53 PM on February 7th, 2025. The key change here involved updating the constructor of the `TestHarnessNodeMonitor` class to utilize the newly refined `createScanner` and then later `createDummyScanner`  function from `TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner` for creating the `PasswordSecurityScanner` instance. This simplifies the instantiation of the test harness, improving code clarity and maintainability.  Finally, the `password_scanner_test::TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner::createDummyScanner()` call was completely removed from the NodeMonitor constructor in the final change.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/CMakeLists.txt` file was updated at 4:17 PM on February 7th, 2025, adding the `PasswordSecurityScannerTest.cpp` and `TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` files to the build process for the `passwordSecurityScannerTest` target, indicating the addition of the new unit tests.


Throughout the modifications, there is a clear pattern of iterative refinement and refactoring.  The development process appears to involve progressively improving the design and implementation of the test harness, culminating in a more streamlined and better-organized structure with improved clarity and reduced complexity.


## 5:27:46 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor`  test suite and the `NodeMonitor` application itself between 4:30 PM and 4:55 PM on February 7th, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner.hpp`: This file underwent multiple revisions. Initially, it contained commented-out static members and a commented-out `createDummyScanner` function.  Subsequent changes added the constructor and moved the definition of the `dummyNodeName` and `dummyStateObjects` outside the class. Finally, unnecessary includes were removed, simplifying the file.  These changes happened between 4:30 PM and 4:37 PM.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/CMakeLists.txt`: This file was updated at 4:31:32 PM, adding several `add_test_128` commands, each specifying source files and linked libraries for different test components.  This suggests an expansion or reorganization of the NodeMonitor test suite.  The inclusion of `configure_file` commands suggests that test files related to OS release and CPU information are being handled.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessNodeMonitor.hpp`: This file, a test harness for `NodeMonitor`,  underwent several revisions between 4:39 PM and 4:55 PM. The primary changes involved the initialization of `pPasswordSecurityScanner`, the instantiation of `TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner`, and clarifying comments about the timing of this instantiation relative to the base class constructor.  The initial versions had commented-out code attempting to create the password scanner in the constructor and later iterations improved the code to wait for the state object to be available and correctly initialize the password security scanner.  The method `getStatefulObjects()` was renamed to `getStateObjects()`.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp`: This file was modified at 4:46 PM and 4:46:57 PM. The changes include additions to the `initializeDiskInfo` function to add the creation and addition of `diskUsages` and `diskInfos` alongside the `diskTotals`.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.hpp`: This header file was modified multiple times between 4:47 PM and 4:49 PM.  The changes are minor, primarily involving the order of includes and potentially the removal of some code, and no significant functional changes are evident from these changes.

In summary, the main focus of the code changes is on improving the `TestHarnessNodeMonitor`, specifically how it initializes `TestHarnessPasswordSecurityScanner` to work correctly with the base class.  The `NodeMonitor` class itself received minor additions to handle disk usage statistics more completely.  The CMakeLists.txt file reflects the addition of new unit tests.  The overall pattern suggests a focused effort on enhancing testing and potentially improving the accuracy of disk utilization reporting.
