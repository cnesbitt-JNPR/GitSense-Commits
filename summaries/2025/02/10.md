# Activity Summary for 2/10/2025

## 10:18:30 AM
The log shows a single code update to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/test/local.init` at 10:15:00 AM on February 10, 2025.  This update modifies the JSON configuration file, specifying 10 CPU cores, an initialization ID of "slice1", and overriding system limits for ARP table size (20), FIB table size (256), flow table size (64), and source lookup table size (64).  The change primarily focuses on resource allocation and configuration parameters.


## 3:18:39 PM
The log shows several code changes across three files: `PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp`, `PasswordSecurityScannerTest.cpp`, and `SystemTestLiterals.hpp`.  The changes span a short period between 2:20 PM and 3:17 PM on February 10, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` underwent two updates within a short time frame (2:20:47 PM and 2:27:39 PM).  These updates appear to be minor; the second commit only modifies the `updateDefaultPasswordAlarmState` function to improve the logic determining the alarm's active state, based on the presence and contents of the "users" array.  The core functionality of scanning the `/etc/shadow` file for default passwords remains unchanged.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/PasswordSecurityScannerTest.cpp` shows a series of commits (2:28:00 PM, 2:28:14 PM, 2:28:22 PM, 2:28:35 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:28:57 PM). These commits primarily refine the unit tests for the `PasswordSecurityScanner`. The most notable change is the simplification of expected JSON responses in several tests related to alarm status.  Specifically, the `"active": true` field was removed from some JSON strings representing the expected alarm status, likely to reflect a change in how the alarm's active status is determined or reported.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/SystemTestLiterals.hpp` was updated three times (2:44:38 PM, 2:51:23 PM, 2:51:35 PM, 2:51:41 PM). These revisions focused on updating the literal JSON strings used in system tests, particularly concerning the `invalidDefaultPasswordAlarm` string, which was changed from an empty object to an object with an incorrectly formatted "users" field, likely to improve test coverage for error handling.  Also noteworthy is a change in `invalidDefaultPasswordAlarm` from `R"( { "users" : [] } )"` to `R"({})"` and later to `R"( { "users" : "admin" } )"` then to `R"({})"` showing some experimentation before settling on an empty object.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/build/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/passwordSecurityScannerTest.log` file shows the execution of the unit tests for `PasswordSecurityScannerTest`, indicating successful execution of most tests.  The log includes debug and error messages.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateTest.cpp` shows two identical commits (2:43:51 PM and 2:44:08 PM) with no apparent change in code.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` underwent two updates (2:56:51 PM and 2:59:14 PM) with no functional changes, and a final update (3:11:45 PM, 3:12:45 PM, 3:16:47 PM) showing incremental changes in tests, but no substantial alterations to the core logic.

In summary, the changes primarily involve refinements to the unit tests and minor adjustments to the alarm status reporting in `PasswordSecurityScanner`.  There's also a series of edits to test literals related to system alarms showing evolution in test cases.  The overall functionality of the password scanner and system change handler seems largely consistent across the commits.


## 4:18:35 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` between 3:23:57 PM and 3:27:49 PM on February 10, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor edits with no discernible changes in functionality.

The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/SystemTestLiterals.hpp` was updated at 3:28:07 PM on February 10, 2025. This file contains test literals for various system states, including CPU utilization, disk utilization, memory utilization, connection status, software version, DNS resolution, configuration node utilization, and default password alarm status.  The update likely involved adding or modifying these test data points.

The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.hpp` underwent several revisions between 4:00:29 PM and 4:03:56 PM on February 10, 2025.  The primary change appears to be the correction of a file path in the constructor from `/etc/128technology/synchronizedDirectories.json` to `"/etc/128technology/synchronizedDirectories.json"`.  There was also a minor refactoring concerning the  `PasswordSecurityScannerPtr` member. The consistent additions and modifications to this file suggest ongoing development and refinement of the `NodeMonitor` class.

The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp` was updated three times between 4:03:04 PM and 4:03:56 PM on February 10, 2025. These changes mainly involved adding `PasswordSecurityScannerPtr` to the class constructor and removing a redundant constructor parameter from the `NodeMonitor` class constructor.  The modifications suggest an iterative refinement of the class' initialization and construction process.

Finally, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessNodeMonitor.hpp` was updated at 4:04:52 PM on February 10, 2025. This file contains a test harness for the `NodeMonitor` class, using mock objects for auditing and other dependencies. The update likely reflects adjustments to the test environment and setup process.  The usage of  `/tmp` for dummy files is notable.
