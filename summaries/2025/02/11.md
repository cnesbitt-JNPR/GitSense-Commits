# Activity Summary for 2/11/2025

## 2:16:53 PM
The log shows a series of code changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src` directory, primarily focused on the `state` and `alarm` libraries.  The changes span from 1:59 PM to 2:14 PM on February 11, 2025.

The most significant changes occur in `System.hpp` and `System.cpp`,  which appear to define a `System` class responsible for managing system state and triggering alarms based on that state.  Multiple updates to `System.hpp` (between 1:59:04 PM and 1:59:47 PM) show minor modifications, likely related to refactoring or typos. The final version of `System.hpp` includes a `System` class that manages various system metrics (CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk utilization, etc.) using a `StateCache` for each metric. It also includes a `ConfigNodeUtilizationContainer` for managing node-specific utilization statistics.

`System.cpp` (updated at 2:03:18 PM and 2:07:22 PM) implements the functionality of the `System` class, handling the updating of caches and triggering notifications of state changes. There are several functions for handling individual system metrics,  using `notifyStateChange` to communicate changes to a `Node` object. There's also JSON serialization/deserialization involved, likely for data persistence or communication with external systems. The later update shows the addition of more elaborate handling for state changes.

`StateLiterals.hpp` (updated at 2:04:23 PM) defines various constants and regular expressions related to state paths, likely used for parsing and manipulating system state information. These constants define state categories (like "system", "platform", "process"), table keys, and leaf elements within the state paths.


`SystemChangeHandler.hpp` and `SystemChangeHandler.cpp` (updated between 2:06:12 PM and 2:10:16 PM) are related to alarm generation. The `SystemChangeHandler` class monitors system state changes defined in `System.hpp` and generates alarms based on predefined thresholds.  The code indicates alarm handling for CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, connection status, configuration application state, entitlement status, NTP servers, SNMP agent state, and default password violations.  The  `SystemChangeHandler.cpp`  shows functions that parse JSON data representing system states, trigger alarms based on conditions and thresholds and modify existing alarms.  The multiple updates here mostly involve minor corrections and refinements to method signatures and internal function names.

Finally, `StateTest.cpp` (updated at 2:12:45 PM) and `SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` (updated at 2:14:05 PM and 2:14:21 PM) contain unit tests for the `state` and `alarm` components respectively, using a mocking framework. The tests cover various aspects of state management and alarm generation, including handling of multiple nodes and different alarm scenarios. The updates to the test file might be due to adding more test cases.

Overall, the code modifications reflect a continuous development process, with a focus on improving the system state management, alarm handling, and testing of these components.  The use of JSON, regular expressions and a state-machine-like design patterns are evident.
