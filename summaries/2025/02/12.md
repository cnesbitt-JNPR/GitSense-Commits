# Activity Summary for 2/12/2025

## 10:02:35 AM
The log shows a single code change on February 12, 2025, at 9:27:09 AM to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp`.  This file contains the implementation of a `PasswordSecurityScanner` class.  The class scans the `/etc/shadow` file (or a user-specified file) for users from a predefined list (`targetUsernames`: "admin", "t128", "root", "centos") who have passwords from a predefined list (`defaultPasswords`: "128Tadmin", "128tRoutes", "128tRoutes!", "exit33").

The code uses regular expressions to parse the shadow file entries, validates SHA-512 password hashes, and compares against the default passwords.  It logs the scan results and updates a state object (though the writing of this state is currently stubbed out with a TODO comment).  The `PasswordSecurityScanner` is designed to run periodically, controlled by a timer (`passwordScanTimer`).  Error handling is included for file reading failures.  The code extensively uses logging for debugging purposes.  The use of `dolly::dynamic` suggests interaction with a data serialization/manipulation library.

The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` file, all occurring within a short time frame on February 12th, 2025, between 12:01:30 PM and 12:01:54 PM.  The changes between revisions are minimal to nonexistent; the file content remains consistent across all four timestamps.

The file is a Robot Framework test suite designed to verify alarm functionality on an HA (High Availability) router. It utilizes several custom libraries (`AlarmHandlerLib`, `LinuxLib`, `NodeConnectivity`, `SSHLib`, `SystemRegistry`, `SystemTunnels`, `T128`) and resources.

The test suite includes three main test cases, each focusing on a different scenario:

1.  `Verify Alarm Count On HA Router`: A baseline test verifying alarm counts under normal operation.
2.  `Verify Alarm Count On HA Router With combo-east-1 Unable To Talk To conductor-east-1`: Tests alarms when half of the conductor traffic is dropped on DUT3 (likely a device under test).
3.  `Verify Alarm Count On HA Router With combo-east-1 Unable To Talk To All Conductor Nodes`: Tests alarms when all conductor traffic is dropped on DUT3.

Each test case involves manipulating a KNI (likely Kernel Network Interface) on `DUT3_ROUTER`, verifying expected alarms, and restoring network connectivity.  The keywords extensively use `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` with a timeout of 3 minutes and 30 seconds, suggesting a reliance on asynchronous operations.  The `Get Expected Alarms List` and `Get Connectivity Alarms List For...` keywords indicate that the test suite dynamically generates expected alarm lists based on the test conditions.  The tests use variables such as `${DUT1}`, `${DUT2}`, `${DUT3}`, `${DUT4}` (likely representing different devices) and `${KNI_INTF_NAME}`. The consistent content across the timestamps suggests that either no changes were made or the changes were saved as a single commit.
