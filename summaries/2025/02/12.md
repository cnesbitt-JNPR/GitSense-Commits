# Activity Summary for 2/12/2025

## 10:02:35 AM
The log shows a single code change on February 12, 2025, at 9:27:09 AM to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp`.  This file contains the implementation of a `PasswordSecurityScanner` class.  The class scans the `/etc/shadow` file (or a user-specified file) for users from a predefined list (`targetUsernames`: "admin", "t128", "root", "centos") who have passwords from a predefined list (`defaultPasswords`: "128Tadmin", "128tRoutes", "128tRoutes!", "exit33").

The code uses regular expressions to parse the shadow file entries, validates SHA-512 password hashes, and compares against the default passwords.  It logs the scan results and updates a state object (though the writing of this state is currently stubbed out with a TODO comment).  The `PasswordSecurityScanner` is designed to run periodically, controlled by a timer (`passwordScanTimer`).  Error handling is included for file reading failures.  The code extensively uses logging for debugging purposes.  The use of `dolly::dynamic` suggests interaction with a data serialization/manipulation library.
