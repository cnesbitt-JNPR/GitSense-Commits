# Activity Summary for 2/13/2025

## 3:04:07 PM
The log shows several revisions to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` file and one revision to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/System.hpp`.

The `PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` file underwent multiple revisions between 2:45:35 PM and 2:58:00 PM on February 13, 2025.  These revisions primarily involved no code changes, only a change in included headers.  Initially, `<state/System.hpp>` was mistakenly included with a typo (`#include <state/System.hpp #include`), corrected in the next commit to `#include <state/System.hpp>`. The core functionality of the `PasswordSecurityScanner` remained consistent across all revisions: it scans the `/etc/shadow` file for users ("admin", "t128", "root", "centos") with default passwords ("128Tadmin", "128tRoutes", "128tRoutes!", "exit33"), verifying SHA-512 password hashes against a list of default passwords.  The results are written to the system state.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/System.hpp` file was updated at 2:56:06 PM on February 13, 2025. This revision added a `setDefaultPasswordViolations` method to the `System` class, which takes a `dolly::fbstring` as input. This aligns with the changes in `PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp`, enabling the password scanner to update the system state with detected password violations.  The `System` class manages various system states, including CPU utilization, memory utilization, and now explicitly, default password violations.


## 5:02:23 PM
The log shows two commits to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp`, both occurring on February 13th, 2025.  The commits are very similar, differing only in a single line within the `writeDefaultPasswordViolations` function.

The file `PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` contains a C++ class responsible for scanning the `/etc/shadow` file for users with default passwords from a predefined list (`defaultPasswords`).  The code checks if the passwords are SHA-512 hashed and compares them against the default passwords.  Target usernames are defined in `targetUsernames`.  The scanner uses regular expressions to parse the shadow file entries.  The results (users with default passwords) are stored in a `dolly::dynamic` object and written to the state (though the second commit shows a change from `dolly::toPrettyJson` to `dolly::toJson`).

The first commit (4:16:34 PM) uses `dolly::toPrettyJson` to format the JSON output, while the second commit (4:16:59 PM) replaces it with `dolly::toJson`.  This suggests a minor code cleanup or a change to the desired JSON formatting.  The rest of the code remains unchanged between the two commits.  The `writeDefaultPasswordViolations` function contains TODO comments indicating that it's a work in progress and will be fully implemented later.
