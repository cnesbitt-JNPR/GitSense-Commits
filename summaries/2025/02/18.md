# Activity Summary for 2/18/2025

## 11:12:45 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` at 2/18/2025, 10:57:17 AM.  This file contains a `PasswordSecurityScanner` class designed to scan the `/etc/shadow` file for users with default passwords from a predefined list (`defaultPasswords`).

The class reads the shadow file, parses each line using regular expressions to extract usernames and passwords, and then checks if the password matches any of the default passwords using SHA-512 hash verification.  It specifically targets usernames listed in the `targetUsernames` set.  If a default password is found, the username is added to a list of violations.  Finally, this violation list is processed (currently with a placeholder `DebugLog` indicating future integration with a state object for writing alarm status). The code includes extensive logging using `DebugLog` and `ErrorLog` for debugging and error handling.  The code also uses several external libraries for file handling, cryptography, and logging.  There are several TODO comments indicating incomplete integration with a state management system (`stateObjects`).
