# Activity Summary for 2/18/2025

## 11:12:45 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` at 2/18/2025, 10:57:17 AM.  This file contains a `PasswordSecurityScanner` class designed to scan the `/etc/shadow` file for users with default passwords from a predefined list (`defaultPasswords`).

The class reads the shadow file, parses each line using regular expressions to extract usernames and passwords, and then checks if the password matches any of the default passwords using SHA-512 hash verification.  It specifically targets usernames listed in the `targetUsernames` set.  If a default password is found, the username is added to a list of violations.  Finally, this violation list is processed (currently with a placeholder `DebugLog` indicating future integration with a state object for writing alarm status). The code includes extensive logging using `DebugLog` and `ErrorLog` for debugging and error handling.  The code also uses several external libraries for file handling, cryptography, and logging.  There are several TODO comments indicating incomplete integration with a state management system (`stateObjects`).


## 2:12:47 PM
The log shows updates to two files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp`.  There were no changes to the content of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` between the second and third timestamps, and between the third and fourth timestamps.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp`**: This file, updated on 2/18/2025 at 1:23:04 PM, implements a password security scanner.  It checks the `/etc/shadow` file (or a custom path) for users ("admin", "t128", "root", "centos") with default passwords ("128Tadmin", "128tRoutes", "128tRoutes!", "exit33"). The scanner uses SHA-512 password hashing for validation.  The code includes logging at different severity levels (DebugLog and ErrorLog).  There are several TODO comments indicating areas for future development, such as improving error handling and integrating with the state system.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp`**: This file, updated multiple times on 2/18/2025 (2:08:38 PM, 2:09:21 PM, and 2:11:26 PM), handles system change events and generates alarms. It registers functions to handle changes related to memory, disk space, CPU utilization, network connections, NTP servers, configuration application status, entitlement status, and more. The code parses JSON data to extract relevant information for alarm generation and uses the `dolly` library extensively for JSON handling and string formatting.  Alarm severities (Critical, Major) are defined. The  updates to this file between the given timestamps appear to be identical, suggesting either no actual changes were made, or there was an error in the logging process.  The code uses a state machine like approach, where actions (Add, Clear, Modify) are performed based on the state of the system.


## 3:12:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to a password security scanner and its supporting cryptographic library.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` file underwent several changes between 2:42 PM and 3:07 PM on February 18, 2025.  Initially, the code scanned `/etc/shadow` for specific usernames ("admin", "t128", "root", "centos") and checked if they had any of a list of default passwords ("128Tadmin", "128tRoutes", "128tRoutes!", "exit33").  The password verification assumed SHA-512 hashing.

A significant modification around 3:05 PM and 3:07 PM introduced function pointers `generateHashFunc` and a conditional selection of the hash algorithm based on the `validateSHA512PasswordHash` result.  Before this change, the code only supported SHA-512.  The later version attempts to detect whether SHA-512 is used.  If not, it indicates that an unsupported hash algorithm is used and does not proceed with the check for default passwords.  The `writeDefaultPasswordViolations` function remained a stub throughout these changes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/crypto/HashUtil.cpp` file was modified at 2:49 PM and 2:55 PM on February 18, 2025. The initial version contained functions for generating and validating both SHA-512 and SHA-256 password hashes, but both used the same salt prefix "$6$" internally. The revision at 2:55 PM corrected this, changing the SHA-256 functions to use the correct "$5$" prefix and adjusting the validation regex accordingly.  This change reflects a better implementation of supporting different hash algorithms in the `HashUtil` library.  The SHA-512 functions remained unchanged.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/crypto/HashUtil.hpp` file was updated at 2:49 PM on February 18, 2025, declaring the functions present in the `.cpp` file.  No substantial changes in functionality occurred here, just a reflection of the `.cpp` file changes.

In summary, the evolution of the code demonstrates iterative improvements in the password security scanner. Initially, it focused solely on SHA-512, but later versions improved by attempting to support other algorithms(although this implementation is incomplete by just logging it instead of handling it) and fixing an internal error in the SHA-256 hashing implementation.  The  `PasswordSecurityScanner` remained incomplete in its reporting of violations to the system state.


## 4:12:51 PM
The log shows a series of code changes to the `PasswordSecurityScanner` class between 3:24 PM and 3:54 PM on February 18, 2025.  The primary focus is improving the `resolveHashAlgorithm` and `doesUserHaveDefaultPassword` functions to correctly identify and handle SHA256 and SHA512 password hashes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` file underwent the most significant changes.  Initially, the `resolveHashAlgorithm` function was incomplete.  Subsequent commits refined it to correctly determine the hash algorithm based on the password format and set the appropriate function pointer and regular expression for parsing the hash. A critical change at approximately 3:35 PM corrected a regex used for SHA256 password hashes (changing from `\$6\$` to `\$5\$`).  Another important fix around 3:34 PM involved correctly using the `hashFunction` pointer in `doesUserHaveDefaultPassword`.  Prior to this, the function wasn't correctly using the resolved hash function, leading to potential errors. The final correction at around 3:45 PM removed unnecessary redundant hash algorithm checks from the `doesUserHaveDefaultPassword` function, improving efficiency.

The header file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.hpp`, also changed, primarily to reflect the changes in the `resolveHashAlgorithm` function signature.  The function's parameter type was modified to pass the hash function by pointer. This change occurred between 3:31 PM and 3:41 PM.

The unit test file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/PasswordSecurityScannerTest.cpp`, remained largely unchanged structurally.  The primary changes here were to update the expected results in test cases to align with the final functionality of the `PasswordSecurityScanner` after the hash algorithm handling was fixed.  These updates occurred between 3:52 PM and 3:54 PM.  The tests cover various scenarios, including empty files, files with unsupported hash algorithms, and various combinations of users with default and non-default passwords.  The tests verify that the `PasswordSecurityScanner` correctly identifies users with default passwords under diverse conditions.  A notable test case, `testDefaultDutShadowFile`, demonstrates testing against a real-world shadow file example.


## 5:12:47 PM
The code implements a `PasswordSecurityScanner` that checks a shadow file for users with default passwords.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/PasswordSecurityScannerTest.cpp` file contains extensive unit tests covering various scenarios, including empty files, files with incorrect hash formats, files with and without target users, and updates leading to violations being introduced, cleared, or changed. These tests are added and modified between 4:13 PM and 4:31 PM on February 18, 2025.  The tests utilize `generateSHA512PasswordHash` and `generateSHA256PasswordHash` functions from the `crypto` module for password hashing verification and handle both SHA256 and SHA512 password formats. A  `testDefaultDutShadowFile` specifically checks a predefined shadow file content.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` file, updated at 5:11 PM on February 18, 2025, contains the implementation of the `PasswordSecurityScanner` class.  This class reads the `/etc/shadow` file (or a custom path), parses each line to extract usernames and passwords, checks against a hardcoded list of default passwords (`defaultPasswords`), and updates the system state with the list of users violating the default password policy. The `resolveHashAlgorithm` function dynamically selects the appropriate hashing algorithm (SHA512 or SHA256) based on the password format.  The code includes placeholder comments for future integration of state updates using `stateObjects`.  Significant parts of the code are marked with `//TODO` comments, indicating areas that require further implementation or cleanup.
