# Activity Summary for 2/18/2025

## 11:12:45 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` at 2/18/2025, 10:57:17 AM.  This file contains a `PasswordSecurityScanner` class designed to scan the `/etc/shadow` file for users with default passwords from a predefined list (`defaultPasswords`).

The class reads the shadow file, parses each line using regular expressions to extract usernames and passwords, and then checks if the password matches any of the default passwords using SHA-512 hash verification.  It specifically targets usernames listed in the `targetUsernames` set.  If a default password is found, the username is added to a list of violations.  Finally, this violation list is processed (currently with a placeholder `DebugLog` indicating future integration with a state object for writing alarm status). The code includes extensive logging using `DebugLog` and `ErrorLog` for debugging and error handling.  The code also uses several external libraries for file handling, cryptography, and logging.  There are several TODO comments indicating incomplete integration with a state management system (`stateObjects`).


## 2:12:47 PM
The log shows updates to two files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp`.  There were no changes to the content of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` between the second and third timestamps, and between the third and fourth timestamps.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp`**: This file, updated on 2/18/2025 at 1:23:04 PM, implements a password security scanner.  It checks the `/etc/shadow` file (or a custom path) for users ("admin", "t128", "root", "centos") with default passwords ("128Tadmin", "128tRoutes", "128tRoutes!", "exit33"). The scanner uses SHA-512 password hashing for validation.  The code includes logging at different severity levels (DebugLog and ErrorLog).  There are several TODO comments indicating areas for future development, such as improving error handling and integrating with the state system.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp`**: This file, updated multiple times on 2/18/2025 (2:08:38 PM, 2:09:21 PM, and 2:11:26 PM), handles system change events and generates alarms. It registers functions to handle changes related to memory, disk space, CPU utilization, network connections, NTP servers, configuration application status, entitlement status, and more. The code parses JSON data to extract relevant information for alarm generation and uses the `dolly` library extensively for JSON handling and string formatting.  Alarm severities (Critical, Major) are defined. The  updates to this file between the given timestamps appear to be identical, suggesting either no actual changes were made, or there was an error in the logging process.  The code uses a state machine like approach, where actions (Add, Clear, Modify) are performed based on the state of the system.
