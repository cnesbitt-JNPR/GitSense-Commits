# Activity Summary for 2/19/2025

## 10:12:45 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/SystemMemberWatchContext.hpp` on February 19, 2025, at 9:18:52 AM.  This file defines a `SystemMemberWatchContext` class, which appears to be a context for monitoring various system member attributes.  The class inherits from `WatchContext` and uses an enum `Type` to specify the monitored attribute (e.g., CPU utilization, memory utilization, software version, etc.).  The  `ENUM_FACTORY_DECLARE_ENUM_STRING` macro suggests automated enum generation. The class includes methods to get the object type, node name, and member type. The code also uses Boost.Filesystem.  The comment indicates a future plan to generate this file from a data model.  The class is fully default-constructible, copyable, and movable.

The log shows a single code change to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/StateWatchManager.cpp` on February 19, 2025, at 10:37:10 AM.  This file contains the implementation of `StateWatchManager`, a class that appears to monitor various state changes within a system.  The code heavily utilizes a `state::Observer` and handles different types of state changes (`onStateChange`) for various objects, including Nodes, Interfaces, Platform Members, System Members, Processes, and Assets. Each object type has a corresponding handler function (e.g., `handleNodeChange`, `handleInterfaceChange`).  These handlers often involve updating a `StateMonitor` object with the changes and adding additional watchers for related objects. The code uses numerous custom types and classes from namespaces like `state`, `process`, `config`, `persistentData`, `util`, and `dolly`.  The code demonstrates a significant amount of logic for handling various types of state updates and managing watchers, suggesting a complex state management system.  The `handleProcessLeaderChange` function, and similar functions for other components, seems to specifically manage leader election for different processes.  Error and debug logging is implemented to handle exceptions and provide diagnostic information.
