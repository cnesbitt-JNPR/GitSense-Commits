The log shows a single code change to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/SystemMemberWatchContext.hpp` on February 19, 2025, at 9:18:52 AM.  This file defines a `SystemMemberWatchContext` class, which appears to be a context for monitoring various system member attributes.  The class inherits from `WatchContext` and uses an enum `Type` to specify the monitored attribute (e.g., CPU utilization, memory utilization, software version, etc.).  The  `ENUM_FACTORY_DECLARE_ENUM_STRING` macro suggests automated enum generation. The class includes methods to get the object type, node name, and member type. The code also uses Boost.Filesystem.  The comment indicates a future plan to generate this file from a data model.  The class is fully default-constructible, copyable, and movable.
