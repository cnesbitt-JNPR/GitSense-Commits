# Activity Summary for 2/19/2025

## 10:12:45 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/SystemMemberWatchContext.hpp` on February 19, 2025, at 9:18:52 AM.  This file defines a `SystemMemberWatchContext` class, which appears to be a context for monitoring various system member attributes.  The class inherits from `WatchContext` and uses an enum `Type` to specify the monitored attribute (e.g., CPU utilization, memory utilization, software version, etc.).  The  `ENUM_FACTORY_DECLARE_ENUM_STRING` macro suggests automated enum generation. The class includes methods to get the object type, node name, and member type. The code also uses Boost.Filesystem.  The comment indicates a future plan to generate this file from a data model.  The class is fully default-constructible, copyable, and movable.


## 11:12:45 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/StateWatchManager.cpp` on February 19, 2025, at 10:37:10 AM.  This file contains the implementation of `StateWatchManager`, a class that appears to monitor various state changes within a system.  The code heavily utilizes a `state::Observer` and handles different types of state changes (`onStateChange`) for various objects, including Nodes, Interfaces, Platform Members, System Members, Processes, and Assets. Each object type has a corresponding handler function (e.g., `handleNodeChange`, `handleInterfaceChange`).  These handlers often involve updating a `StateMonitor` object with the changes and adding additional watchers for related objects. The code uses numerous custom types and classes from namespaces like `state`, `process`, `config`, `persistentData`, `util`, and `dolly`.  The code demonstrates a significant amount of logic for handling various types of state updates and managing watchers, suggesting a complex state management system.  The `handleProcessLeaderChange` function, and similar functions for other components, seems to specifically manage leader election for different processes.  Error and debug logging is implemented to handle exceptions and provide diagnostic information.


## 12:12:47 PM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateObserverTest.cpp` between 11:24 AM and 11:36 AM on February 19, 2025.  No changes were made to the file's content during this period; the code remained identical across all revisions.  A separate file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp`, was updated at 11:52:17 AM on the same day. This file introduces a `PasswordSecurityScanner` class which scans the `/etc/shadow` file for users ("admin", "t128", "root", "centos") with default passwords from a predefined list ("128Tadmin", "128tRoutes", "128tRoutes!", "exit33").  The class uses regular expressions to parse the shadow file,  `crypto::validateSHA512PasswordHash` and `crypto::validateSHA256PasswordHash` functions to identify hash algorithms, and then updates the application state with the list of users who have default passwords.  The update includes logging statements at various points to track the progress and any errors encountered during the scan.  The `writeDefaultPasswordViolations` function is a placeholder (indicated by a TODO comment), suggesting ongoing development.


## 3:12:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` on February 19th, 2025.

The `AlarmHandlerLib.py` file underwent several updates between 2:18:42 PM and 2:39:58 PM.  The primary change was the implementation of the `get_default_password_alarms` function. Initially, this function was empty.  Subsequent revisions added logic to filter alarms based on a message containing "The following accounts have default passwords...". The filtering changed from checking if the message simply contained the substring to checking if it started with the full string.  The  `get_default_password_alarms` function initially retrieved shelved alarms only, but was later modified to retrieve all alarms (ShelvedStatus.ALL).

The `AlarmHA.robot` file was modified once, at 2:54:26 PM. This revision involved minor changes in the `Verify Admin Down Alarm With Partial Conductor Connectivity On` and `Verify Admin Down Alarm With No Conductor Connectivity On` keywords.  These changes adjusted the ignored alarms list to include the results from `Get Default Password Alarms`, enhancing the test's accuracy.  Both files deal with alarm handling and testing, indicating a coordinated effort to improve the alarm management system.  The `AlarmHandlerLib.py` focuses on providing functions for retrieving and verifying alarms, while `AlarmHA.robot` uses these functions to implement several test cases for verifying alarm behavior in different scenarios, particularly related to High Availability (HA) routers and network connectivity. The tests use a consistent pattern of verifying alarms after manipulating network interfaces (`kniTest`) and checking for expected alarm messages based on connectivity statuses.
