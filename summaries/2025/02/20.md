# Activity Summary for 2/20/2025

## 10:12:47 AM
The log shows modifications to Robot Framework test suites and a library related to alarm handling.

On February 20, 2025, the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` file underwent two updates, at 9:27:22 AM and 9:30:57 AM.  Both versions contain Robot Framework test cases (`Verify Alarm Count On HA Router`, etc.) designed to test alarm behavior on an HA router under various network conditions (e.g., dropping conductor traffic).  The tests consistently use keywords like `Wait For Stable Connectivity Between All Duts`, `Add Kni Interface`, `Set ... Interface ... To Enabled`, and `Verify Admin Down Alarm`, suggesting a structured approach to testing alarm generation and clearance. The second version differs only by replacing  `Teardown Alarm HA Test` with `Run Keyword And Ignore Error Delete Kni Interface ... Run Keyword And Ignore Error Restore All Conductor Traffic On DUT3` in the keywords section. This change suggests an attempt to improve error handling during test teardown by ignoring potential errors during cleanup of resources.

At 9:45:17 AM and 9:51:32 AM, the  `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py` file was modified twice. These updates focus on refining the `Alarm` class and its methods.  The `Alarm` class represents an alarm with attributes like `node`, `router`, `message`, `severity`, and `shelved_status`. Several methods (`get_all_alarms`, `get_current_alarms`, `get_shelved_alarms`, `get_default_password_alarms`, `verify_all_alarms`, `verify_current_alarms`) provide functionality for retrieving and verifying alarms based on different criteria (all alarms, current alarms, shelved alarms, alarms related to default passwords).  The second update to the file only adds a more descriptive debug log in `get_default_password_alarms` function to specify that it finds default password alarms, instead of just mentioning alarms.  The core functionality remains unchanged.  The library uses the `RestLib` for making REST API calls to retrieve alarm data, suggesting integration with a remote system.


## 11:12:46 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` underwent two updates on February 20, 2025.  Both updates at 10:18:28 AM and 10:19:23 AM involved minor changes.  The changes primarily involved updating the `Get T128 Connection` keyword argument in the `Add Kni Interface` keyword. The rest of the file's content—including test cases focused on verifying alarm counts on an HA router under various network connectivity scenarios (dropping conductor traffic, manipulating KNI interfaces)—remained consistent across both revisions.  The test suite uses multiple libraries for network interactions, alarm handling, and system administration tasks, suggesting a comprehensive approach to testing the HA router's alarm system.  The tests repeatedly use keywords like `Wait For Stable Connectivity Between All Duts` and `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms`, which points to a focus on stability and ensuring the absence of unexpected alarms after various manipulations.  The tests also include tags such as `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel`, implying a role in nightly regression testing for different operating system distributions.


## 12:12:46 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` (last updated 2/20/2025, 11:16:44 AM) focuses on verifying alarm behavior on an HA router.  It uses numerous libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `LinuxLib`, `NodeConnectivity`, `SSHLib`, `SystemRegistry`, `SystemTunnels`, `T128`) and resources (`TestbedStore.robot`, `BaseSuiteVariables.robot`).

The test suite defines variables for topology, interface name (`kniTest`), and flags for legacy parameters and top alarm endpoint usage.

Three main test cases (`Verify Alarm Count On HA Router`) examine alarm counts under different network conditions:

1.  **Connectivity to one Conductor Node:**  Manipulates a KNI interface (`kniTest`) on `DUT3` to trigger and verify an admin down alarm, then checks overall alarm counts.
2.  **Partial Conductor Connectivity:**  Drops half of the conductor traffic on `DUT3`, verifies connectivity issues, and checks for specific alarms related to partial connectivity failures.
3.  **No Conductor Connectivity:**  Drops all conductor traffic on `DUT3`, verifies a complete loss of connectivity to conductor nodes, and checks for corresponding alarms.

The suite includes keywords for setup and teardown, handling Linux connections, ignoring errors during cleanup (e.g., deleting KNI interfaces), and waiting for stable connectivity between various Duts (DUT1-DUT4).  Many keywords involve verifying alarm states, comparing actual alarms against expected lists, factoring in ignored alarms (likely default password related). The `Get Expected Alarms List` and `Get Connectivity Alarms List` keywords appear to dynamically build dictionaries representing different alarm types based on the scenario.  These are then used in comparisons within `Verify Current Alarms`. The tests heavily rely on manipulating network connectivity to induce and verify specific alarm conditions.


## 1:12:46 PM
The provided log shows three revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py` file.  All revisions are within a short timeframe on February 20th, 2025, between 1:03 PM and 1:07 PM. The file contains a Python library for handling alarms, primarily focusing on retrieving and verifying alarms from devices.

Key changes across the revisions are minimal and appear to be bug fixes:


* **`get_default_password_alarms` function:** The most notable change is within the `get_default_password_alarms` function.  In the first revision, the log message references `each_alarm['id']`, while in the subsequent revisions this is corrected to `each_alarm['alarm-id']`, suggesting a minor bug fix in how the alarm ID was accessed.

* **No other significant code changes:**  The core functionality of retrieving alarms ( `get_all_alarms`, `get_current_alarms`, `get_shelved_alarms` ), filtering alarms by time range (`get_alarms_for_given_time_range`), and verifying alarm sets (`verify_all_alarms`, `verify_current_alarms`) remains consistent across all three revisions. The `Alarm` class definition also remains unchanged.

In summary, the code modifications are minor and focused on correcting how alarm IDs are accessed within the logging statements. The overall structure and functionality of the AlarmHandlerLib.py remain consistent.
