# Activity Summary for 2/20/2025

## 10:12:47 AM
The log shows modifications to Robot Framework test suites and a library related to alarm handling.

On February 20, 2025, the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` file underwent two updates, at 9:27:22 AM and 9:30:57 AM.  Both versions contain Robot Framework test cases (`Verify Alarm Count On HA Router`, etc.) designed to test alarm behavior on an HA router under various network conditions (e.g., dropping conductor traffic).  The tests consistently use keywords like `Wait For Stable Connectivity Between All Duts`, `Add Kni Interface`, `Set ... Interface ... To Enabled`, and `Verify Admin Down Alarm`, suggesting a structured approach to testing alarm generation and clearance. The second version differs only by replacing  `Teardown Alarm HA Test` with `Run Keyword And Ignore Error Delete Kni Interface ... Run Keyword And Ignore Error Restore All Conductor Traffic On DUT3` in the keywords section. This change suggests an attempt to improve error handling during test teardown by ignoring potential errors during cleanup of resources.

At 9:45:17 AM and 9:51:32 AM, the  `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py` file was modified twice. These updates focus on refining the `Alarm` class and its methods.  The `Alarm` class represents an alarm with attributes like `node`, `router`, `message`, `severity`, and `shelved_status`. Several methods (`get_all_alarms`, `get_current_alarms`, `get_shelved_alarms`, `get_default_password_alarms`, `verify_all_alarms`, `verify_current_alarms`) provide functionality for retrieving and verifying alarms based on different criteria (all alarms, current alarms, shelved alarms, alarms related to default passwords).  The second update to the file only adds a more descriptive debug log in `get_default_password_alarms` function to specify that it finds default password alarms, instead of just mentioning alarms.  The core functionality remains unchanged.  The library uses the `RestLib` for making REST API calls to retrieve alarm data, suggesting integration with a remote system.


## 11:12:46 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` underwent two updates on February 20, 2025.  Both updates at 10:18:28 AM and 10:19:23 AM involved minor changes.  The changes primarily involved updating the `Get T128 Connection` keyword argument in the `Add Kni Interface` keyword. The rest of the file's content—including test cases focused on verifying alarm counts on an HA router under various network connectivity scenarios (dropping conductor traffic, manipulating KNI interfaces)—remained consistent across both revisions.  The test suite uses multiple libraries for network interactions, alarm handling, and system administration tasks, suggesting a comprehensive approach to testing the HA router's alarm system.  The tests repeatedly use keywords like `Wait For Stable Connectivity Between All Duts` and `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms`, which points to a focus on stability and ensuring the absence of unexpected alarms after various manipulations.  The tests also include tags such as `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel`, implying a role in nightly regression testing for different operating system distributions.


## 12:12:46 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` (last updated 2/20/2025, 11:16:44 AM) focuses on verifying alarm behavior on an HA router.  It uses numerous libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `LinuxLib`, `NodeConnectivity`, `SSHLib`, `SystemRegistry`, `SystemTunnels`, `T128`) and resources (`TestbedStore.robot`, `BaseSuiteVariables.robot`).

The test suite defines variables for topology, interface name (`kniTest`), and flags for legacy parameters and top alarm endpoint usage.

Three main test cases (`Verify Alarm Count On HA Router`) examine alarm counts under different network conditions:

1.  **Connectivity to one Conductor Node:**  Manipulates a KNI interface (`kniTest`) on `DUT3` to trigger and verify an admin down alarm, then checks overall alarm counts.
2.  **Partial Conductor Connectivity:**  Drops half of the conductor traffic on `DUT3`, verifies connectivity issues, and checks for specific alarms related to partial connectivity failures.
3.  **No Conductor Connectivity:**  Drops all conductor traffic on `DUT3`, verifies a complete loss of connectivity to conductor nodes, and checks for corresponding alarms.

The suite includes keywords for setup and teardown, handling Linux connections, ignoring errors during cleanup (e.g., deleting KNI interfaces), and waiting for stable connectivity between various Duts (DUT1-DUT4).  Many keywords involve verifying alarm states, comparing actual alarms against expected lists, factoring in ignored alarms (likely default password related). The `Get Expected Alarms List` and `Get Connectivity Alarms List` keywords appear to dynamically build dictionaries representing different alarm types based on the scenario.  These are then used in comparisons within `Verify Current Alarms`. The tests heavily rely on manipulating network connectivity to induce and verify specific alarm conditions.


## 1:12:46 PM
The provided log shows three revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py` file.  All revisions are within a short timeframe on February 20th, 2025, between 1:03 PM and 1:07 PM. The file contains a Python library for handling alarms, primarily focusing on retrieving and verifying alarms from devices.

Key changes across the revisions are minimal and appear to be bug fixes:


* **`get_default_password_alarms` function:** The most notable change is within the `get_default_password_alarms` function.  In the first revision, the log message references `each_alarm['id']`, while in the subsequent revisions this is corrected to `each_alarm['alarm-id']`, suggesting a minor bug fix in how the alarm ID was accessed.

* **No other significant code changes:**  The core functionality of retrieving alarms ( `get_all_alarms`, `get_current_alarms`, `get_shelved_alarms` ), filtering alarms by time range (`get_alarms_for_given_time_range`), and verifying alarm sets (`verify_all_alarms`, `verify_current_alarms`) remains consistent across all three revisions. The `Alarm` class definition also remains unchanged.

In summary, the code modifications are minor and focused on correcting how alarm IDs are accessed within the logging statements. The overall structure and functionality of the AlarmHandlerLib.py remain consistent.


## 2:12:47 PM
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py` file and the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` file on February 20, 2025.

The `AlarmHandlerLib.py` file was modified twice, with minor changes between the two commits.  The first commit (1:14:16 PM) contains a comprehensive library for handling alarms, including functions to retrieve all, current, shelved, and default password alarms. It also includes functions to verify alarm states against expected and ignored alarms. The second commit (1:50:29 PM) shows a minor change in the `get_default_password_alarms` function; it removed a logging statement related to the alarm message. The core functionality of the library remains unchanged.  The `Alarm` class is central to the library, providing methods to represent and compare alarm data.

The `AlarmHA.robot` file was also modified twice, both times at 2:11:18 PM and 2:11:24 PM. These changes appear to be nearly identical, suggesting a possible accidental double commit or a very minor, inconsequential edit.  The file is a Robot Framework test suite designed to verify alarm handling on a high-availability (HA) router.  The test cases manipulate network connectivity (adding and deleting interfaces, dropping traffic), then verify the presence or absence of specific alarms using keywords defined in the `AlarmHandlerLib.py` file. The keywords utilize functions from `AlarmHandlerLib.py` to check alarm counts and states.  The tests extensively use variables to define DUTs, interfaces, and expected alarm states, demonstrating a well-structured approach to test automation.  The test suite uses various libraries for network manipulation, SSH, and system interaction.


## 3:12:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Python library (`AlarmHandlerLib.py`) and a Robot Framework test suite (`AlarmHA.robot`).  The library handles alarm retrieval and verification from network devices.  Significant changes occur between 2:19:36 PM and 2:24:40 PM in `AlarmHandlerLib.py`, primarily involving the `check_for_default_password_alarms` function.  This function's implementation changed from simply checking if a list of default password alarms is populated to using `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` to ensure the alarms are eventually found, indicating improvements in robustness.

The `AlarmHandlerLib.py` file consistently defines functions to retrieve all alarms, current alarms, shelved alarms, and alarms related to default passwords. These functions utilize a REST API (`RestLib`) for data retrieval and incorporate time-range filtering using the `datetimerange` library.  The `Alarm` class is used consistently to represent individual alarms, storing various attributes including ID, node, router, process, source, time, message, category, severity, and shelving information.

The `AlarmHA.robot` file contains test cases that verify alarm counts and states on a High Availability (HA) router.  These tests manipulate network interfaces (`kniTest`), simulate connectivity issues (dropping traffic), and then use the `AlarmHandlerLib` functions to check for expected alarms and ensure no unexpected alarms occur.  Several changes in `AlarmHA.robot` add log statements ("verify point 1", "verify point 2", etc.)  to aid debugging and track execution, occurring between 2:29:14 PM and 2:59:13 PM.  The keywords within `AlarmHA.robot` are designed to comprehensively test alarm functionality in different network scenarios.  The `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` is used extensively, indicating a strategy for handling potential delays in alarm propagation.  The final revision of `AlarmHA.robot` includes more detailed logging statements within the test cases.
