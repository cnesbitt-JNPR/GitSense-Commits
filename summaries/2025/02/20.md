# Activity Summary for 2/20/2025

The log shows modifications to Robot Framework test suites and a library related to alarm handling.

On February 20, 2025, the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` file underwent two updates, at 9:27:22 AM and 9:30:57 AM.  Both versions contain Robot Framework test cases (`Verify Alarm Count On HA Router`, etc.) designed to test alarm behavior on an HA router under various network conditions (e.g., dropping conductor traffic).  The tests consistently use keywords like `Wait For Stable Connectivity Between All Duts`, `Add Kni Interface`, `Set ... Interface ... To Enabled`, and `Verify Admin Down Alarm`, suggesting a structured approach to testing alarm generation and clearance. The second version differs only by replacing  `Teardown Alarm HA Test` with `Run Keyword And Ignore Error Delete Kni Interface ... Run Keyword And Ignore Error Restore All Conductor Traffic On DUT3` in the keywords section. This change suggests an attempt to improve error handling during test teardown by ignoring potential errors during cleanup of resources.

At 9:45:17 AM and 9:51:32 AM, the  `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py` file was modified twice. These updates focus on refining the `Alarm` class and its methods.  The `Alarm` class represents an alarm with attributes like `node`, `router`, `message`, `severity`, and `shelved_status`. Several methods (`get_all_alarms`, `get_current_alarms`, `get_shelved_alarms`, `get_default_password_alarms`, `verify_all_alarms`, `verify_current_alarms`) provide functionality for retrieving and verifying alarms based on different criteria (all alarms, current alarms, shelved alarms, alarms related to default passwords).  The second update to the file only adds a more descriptive debug log in `get_default_password_alarms` function to specify that it finds default password alarms, instead of just mentioning alarms.  The core functionality remains unchanged.  The library uses the `RestLib` for making REST API calls to retrieve alarm data, suggesting integration with a remote system.
