# Activity Summary for 2/21/2025

## 10:12:49 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Robot Framework test suite (`AlarmHA.robot`) and a Python library (`AlarmHandlerLib.py`) focused on alarm handling and verification.  The most significant changes occur in `AlarmHA.robot`.

**AlarmHandlerLib.py (2/21/2025, 9:16:12 AM):** This file defines a Python library for handling alarms.  It includes classes for representing alarms (`Alarm`), managing their status (`ShelvedStatus`), and several functions for retrieving alarms based on various criteria (all alarms, current alarms, shelved alarms, alarms within a specific time range, and alarms related to default passwords).  The library uses REST API calls (`RestLib`) to fetch alarm data.  The `Alarm` class provides methods for accessing alarm attributes, comparing alarms, and converting them to dictionaries.  The functions use `use_legacy_parameters` and `use_top_level_alarm_endpoint` flags for flexibility in API interaction. The `verify_all_alarms` function allows for comparison of retrieved alarms against expected and ignored alarms.

**AlarmHA.robot (Multiple Revisions):** This Robot Framework test suite undergoes several revisions between 9:27 AM and 10:06 AM.  The core functionality remains consistent: verifying alarm counts and states on an HA router under various network conditions (e.g., dropping network traffic to simulate connectivity issues). The test suite uses the `AlarmHandlerLib` library extensively.

* **Early Revisions (9:27 AM and 9:35 AM):** The initial revisions primarily focus on setting up the test environment, defining variables (like `${KNI_INTF_NAME}`, `${USE_LEGACY_PARAMS}`, `${USE_TOP_ALARM_ENDPOINT}`), and establishing the test cases.  The test cases involve manipulating network interfaces (`Add Kni Interface`, `Set ... Interface ... To Enabled`, `Delete Kni Interface`), inducing network issues, and verifying the presence or absence of specific alarms using `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms` and variations thereof.  These versions show an evolution in the `Verify ... Alarms` keywords, refining how expected and ignored alarms are handled, and adding logging for debugging purposes.

* **Later Revisions (9:44 AM and 10:06 AM):**  The later revisions demonstrate a refinement in the handling of default password alarms. The `Append Default Password Alarms To` keyword and its usage within the test cases become more prominent.  The keyword `Get Default Password Alarms` is used to collect these specific alarms.  The for loop iterating over password alarms to create dictionaries is refined for better readability and handling of potential index errors.  A pattern emerges where alarms are consistently compared against expected and ignored lists (`expected_alarms`, `ignored_alarms`).

In summary, the code evolution demonstrates a systematic approach to building a robust test suite for verifying alarm functionality in a network environment. The changes show a progression from establishing basic test cases to handling edge cases (default password alarms) and improving code readability and error handling.  The consistent use of  `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` indicates a focus on reliable test execution despite potential delays in the system under test.


## 11:12:48 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` underwent several revisions on February 21, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent throughoutâ€”verifying alarm counts on an HA router under various network conditions.  The changes primarily involved refinements to keyword definitions, specifically within the `Keywords` section.

Early revisions (10:15:53 AM, 10:16:38 AM, 10:22:24 AM, 10:24:45 AM) show minor inconsistencies in how `Append Default Password Alarms To` was used within the keywords, sometimes using `@{alarms}` and other times `${alarms}`.  These were likely minor syntax errors corrected in later commits.

A significant change occurred between 10:27:08 AM and 10:27:15 AM.  The `Append Default Password Alarms To` keyword usage was standardized to use `${alarms}`. Furthermore, the `Get Default Password Alarms` keyword was introduced, improving code clarity and potentially efficiency by separating the password alarm retrieval logic.


A final key change happened between 10:28:04 AM and 10:41:56 AM.  The `Set Variable` keyword replaced the `Set Variable` keyword within the loop in `Check For Default Password Alarms`, a small but potentially important change for variable handling.

The latest revisions (10:56:24 AM and 10:57:37 AM) further refined the keyword section. Notably,  `@{ignored_alarms}` is consistently initialized with `Create List` and then populated using `Append Default Password Alarms To` in multiple keywords, which demonstrates a commitment to consistent coding style and better maintainability. The `Get Expected Alarms List` keyword was also truncated, implying a potential refactoring of this logic.  The final version at 10:57:37 AM shows the keyword ending abruptly, indicating that it is incomplete and likely needs further work.


Throughout all revisions, the test cases remained largely unchanged. They consistently tested alarm behavior with varying degrees of connectivity to conductor nodes (full connectivity, half connectivity, and no connectivity), using the `kniTest` interface.  The `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` tags suggest these are regularly run integration tests.  The file consistently uses a `four_duts` topology defined in `topologies/four_duts/ConductorHAToComboHA.robot`.


## 12:12:49 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` underwent several revisions on February 21st, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be refining the handling of alarms, specifically related to HA router functionality.

The initial version (11:22:16 AM)  included three test cases (`Verify Alarm Count On HA Router`,  `Verify Alarm Count On HA Router With combo-east-1 Unable To Talk To conductor-east-1`, and `Verify Alarm Count On HA Router With combo-east-1 Unable To Talk To All Conductor Nodes`) which verify alarm counts under different network connectivity scenarios (full connectivity, half conductor traffic dropped, and all conductor traffic dropped).  These tests utilize various keywords like `Wait For Stable Connectivity Between All Duts`, `Add Kni Interface`, `Set ... Interface To Enabled`,  `Delete Kni Interface`, and  `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms`.  The tests employ a `kniTest` interface and leverage several libraries including `AlarmHandlerLib`, `NodeConnectivity`, and `SystemTunnels`.

Subsequent updates (11:22:56 AM, 11:23:31 AM, 11:26:31 AM, 11:28:42 AM) primarily involved consistent modifications to the `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms` keyword and related test cases.  The changes were incremental and centered around the variable `ALL_DUTS`, initially set as a suite variable, which was consistently changed to be a global variable  `ALL_DEVICES`.  This suggests a refactoring effort to improve variable management and scope.

A notable change occurred around 12:04:37 PM, with the `@{expected_alarms}` variable in the  `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms` keyword being set to `${None}`.  This change implies a modification to the expected alarm behavior and potentially how alarms are handled within the `Verify Current Alarms` keyword. The next two changes (12:06:58 PM and 12:07:20 PM) further refined the alarm handling logic, specifically within the `Verify Current Alarms` keyword and the addition of the `${alarm_dict}` to the return value within the `Append Default Password Alarms To` keyword. These final revisions indicate a shift towards more robust and explicit alarm verification and management.  The consistent use of  `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds 3m 30s` suggests a timeout mechanism for network stability checks.  All versions used the topology definition file `topologies/four_duts/ConductorHAToComboHA.robot`.


## 1:12:47 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` underwent several revisions on February 21, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be refining the `Get Expected Alarms List` and related keywords within the test suite.

The initial version (12:58:27 PM) included comprehensive test cases (`Verify Alarm Count On HA Router`, variations thereof) that involved manipulating network interfaces (`Add Kni Interface`, `Set ... Interface To Enabled`, `Delete Kni Interface`), controlling network traffic (`Drop Half Conductor Traffic`, `Drop All Conductor Traffic`, `Restore ... Traffic`), and verifying alarm states (`Verify Admin Down Alarm`, `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms`).  These tests utilize numerous custom keywords, such as those for managing Linux connections,  node connectivity, SSH, and system registries and tunnels.  The tests are tagged with `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel`, suggesting a nightly testing process across different RHEL versions.

Subsequent revisions (12:58:55 PM, 12:59:24 PM, 12:59:47 PM) primarily focused on the `Get Expected Alarms List` and the handling of `ignored_alarms` (specifically default password alarms).  The `Append Default Password Alarms To` keyword is consistently used and refined. The structure of the test cases and libraries remained largely unchanged, highlighting a concentrated effort on improving alarm handling logic.  A notable change between 12:59:24 PM and 12:59:47 PM was adding more detail to the  `&{admin_down_alarm}` dictionary in `Get Expected Alarms List`,  specifying the interface name in the alarm message.

The final revision at 1:08:14 PM further refined the alarm handling, showing that the `@{ignored_alarms}` variable was further improved to be more accurately defined and potentially reused.  The core functionality of the test suite stayed intact but became more precise in defining expected and ignored alarms, making the error handling and reporting of test results more accurate.  There were no substantial changes made to the Test Cases themselves.
