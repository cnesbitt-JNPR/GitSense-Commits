# Activity Summary for 2/21/2025

## 10:12:49 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Robot Framework test suite (`AlarmHA.robot`) and a Python library (`AlarmHandlerLib.py`) focused on alarm handling and verification.  The most significant changes occur in `AlarmHA.robot`.

**AlarmHandlerLib.py (2/21/2025, 9:16:12 AM):** This file defines a Python library for handling alarms.  It includes classes for representing alarms (`Alarm`), managing their status (`ShelvedStatus`), and several functions for retrieving alarms based on various criteria (all alarms, current alarms, shelved alarms, alarms within a specific time range, and alarms related to default passwords).  The library uses REST API calls (`RestLib`) to fetch alarm data.  The `Alarm` class provides methods for accessing alarm attributes, comparing alarms, and converting them to dictionaries.  The functions use `use_legacy_parameters` and `use_top_level_alarm_endpoint` flags for flexibility in API interaction. The `verify_all_alarms` function allows for comparison of retrieved alarms against expected and ignored alarms.

**AlarmHA.robot (Multiple Revisions):** This Robot Framework test suite undergoes several revisions between 9:27 AM and 10:06 AM.  The core functionality remains consistent: verifying alarm counts and states on an HA router under various network conditions (e.g., dropping network traffic to simulate connectivity issues). The test suite uses the `AlarmHandlerLib` library extensively.

* **Early Revisions (9:27 AM and 9:35 AM):** The initial revisions primarily focus on setting up the test environment, defining variables (like `${KNI_INTF_NAME}`, `${USE_LEGACY_PARAMS}`, `${USE_TOP_ALARM_ENDPOINT}`), and establishing the test cases.  The test cases involve manipulating network interfaces (`Add Kni Interface`, `Set ... Interface ... To Enabled`, `Delete Kni Interface`), inducing network issues, and verifying the presence or absence of specific alarms using `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms` and variations thereof.  These versions show an evolution in the `Verify ... Alarms` keywords, refining how expected and ignored alarms are handled, and adding logging for debugging purposes.

* **Later Revisions (9:44 AM and 10:06 AM):**  The later revisions demonstrate a refinement in the handling of default password alarms. The `Append Default Password Alarms To` keyword and its usage within the test cases become more prominent.  The keyword `Get Default Password Alarms` is used to collect these specific alarms.  The for loop iterating over password alarms to create dictionaries is refined for better readability and handling of potential index errors.  A pattern emerges where alarms are consistently compared against expected and ignored lists (`expected_alarms`, `ignored_alarms`).

In summary, the code evolution demonstrates a systematic approach to building a robust test suite for verifying alarm functionality in a network environment. The changes show a progression from establishing basic test cases to handling edge cases (default password alarms) and improving code readability and error handling.  The consistent use of  `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` indicates a focus on reliable test execution despite potential delays in the system under test.


## 11:12:48 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` underwent several revisions on February 21, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent throughoutâ€”verifying alarm counts on an HA router under various network conditions.  The changes primarily involved refinements to keyword definitions, specifically within the `Keywords` section.

Early revisions (10:15:53 AM, 10:16:38 AM, 10:22:24 AM, 10:24:45 AM) show minor inconsistencies in how `Append Default Password Alarms To` was used within the keywords, sometimes using `@{alarms}` and other times `${alarms}`.  These were likely minor syntax errors corrected in later commits.

A significant change occurred between 10:27:08 AM and 10:27:15 AM.  The `Append Default Password Alarms To` keyword usage was standardized to use `${alarms}`. Furthermore, the `Get Default Password Alarms` keyword was introduced, improving code clarity and potentially efficiency by separating the password alarm retrieval logic.


A final key change happened between 10:28:04 AM and 10:41:56 AM.  The `Set Variable` keyword replaced the `Set Variable` keyword within the loop in `Check For Default Password Alarms`, a small but potentially important change for variable handling.

The latest revisions (10:56:24 AM and 10:57:37 AM) further refined the keyword section. Notably,  `@{ignored_alarms}` is consistently initialized with `Create List` and then populated using `Append Default Password Alarms To` in multiple keywords, which demonstrates a commitment to consistent coding style and better maintainability. The `Get Expected Alarms List` keyword was also truncated, implying a potential refactoring of this logic.  The final version at 10:57:37 AM shows the keyword ending abruptly, indicating that it is incomplete and likely needs further work.


Throughout all revisions, the test cases remained largely unchanged. They consistently tested alarm behavior with varying degrees of connectivity to conductor nodes (full connectivity, half connectivity, and no connectivity), using the `kniTest` interface.  The `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` tags suggest these are regularly run integration tests.  The file consistently uses a `four_duts` topology defined in `topologies/four_duts/ConductorHAToComboHA.robot`.


## 12:12:49 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` underwent several revisions on February 21st, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be refining the handling of alarms, specifically related to HA router functionality.

The initial version (11:22:16 AM)  included three test cases (`Verify Alarm Count On HA Router`,  `Verify Alarm Count On HA Router With combo-east-1 Unable To Talk To conductor-east-1`, and `Verify Alarm Count On HA Router With combo-east-1 Unable To Talk To All Conductor Nodes`) which verify alarm counts under different network connectivity scenarios (full connectivity, half conductor traffic dropped, and all conductor traffic dropped).  These tests utilize various keywords like `Wait For Stable Connectivity Between All Duts`, `Add Kni Interface`, `Set ... Interface To Enabled`,  `Delete Kni Interface`, and  `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms`.  The tests employ a `kniTest` interface and leverage several libraries including `AlarmHandlerLib`, `NodeConnectivity`, and `SystemTunnels`.

Subsequent updates (11:22:56 AM, 11:23:31 AM, 11:26:31 AM, 11:28:42 AM) primarily involved consistent modifications to the `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms` keyword and related test cases.  The changes were incremental and centered around the variable `ALL_DUTS`, initially set as a suite variable, which was consistently changed to be a global variable  `ALL_DEVICES`.  This suggests a refactoring effort to improve variable management and scope.

A notable change occurred around 12:04:37 PM, with the `@{expected_alarms}` variable in the  `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms` keyword being set to `${None}`.  This change implies a modification to the expected alarm behavior and potentially how alarms are handled within the `Verify Current Alarms` keyword. The next two changes (12:06:58 PM and 12:07:20 PM) further refined the alarm handling logic, specifically within the `Verify Current Alarms` keyword and the addition of the `${alarm_dict}` to the return value within the `Append Default Password Alarms To` keyword. These final revisions indicate a shift towards more robust and explicit alarm verification and management.  The consistent use of  `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds 3m 30s` suggests a timeout mechanism for network stability checks.  All versions used the topology definition file `topologies/four_duts/ConductorHAToComboHA.robot`.


## 1:12:47 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` underwent several revisions on February 21, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be refining the `Get Expected Alarms List` and related keywords within the test suite.

The initial version (12:58:27 PM) included comprehensive test cases (`Verify Alarm Count On HA Router`, variations thereof) that involved manipulating network interfaces (`Add Kni Interface`, `Set ... Interface To Enabled`, `Delete Kni Interface`), controlling network traffic (`Drop Half Conductor Traffic`, `Drop All Conductor Traffic`, `Restore ... Traffic`), and verifying alarm states (`Verify Admin Down Alarm`, `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms`).  These tests utilize numerous custom keywords, such as those for managing Linux connections,  node connectivity, SSH, and system registries and tunnels.  The tests are tagged with `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel`, suggesting a nightly testing process across different RHEL versions.

Subsequent revisions (12:58:55 PM, 12:59:24 PM, 12:59:47 PM) primarily focused on the `Get Expected Alarms List` and the handling of `ignored_alarms` (specifically default password alarms).  The `Append Default Password Alarms To` keyword is consistently used and refined. The structure of the test cases and libraries remained largely unchanged, highlighting a concentrated effort on improving alarm handling logic.  A notable change between 12:59:24 PM and 12:59:47 PM was adding more detail to the  `&{admin_down_alarm}` dictionary in `Get Expected Alarms List`,  specifying the interface name in the alarm message.

The final revision at 1:08:14 PM further refined the alarm handling, showing that the `@{ignored_alarms}` variable was further improved to be more accurately defined and potentially reused.  The core functionality of the test suite stayed intact but became more precise in defining expected and ignored alarms, making the error handling and reporting of test results more accurate.  There were no substantial changes made to the Test Cases themselves.


## 2:12:48 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot`, a Robot Framework test suite.  The file underwent significant changes between 1:17 PM and 1:50 PM on February 21, 2025.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions: verifying alarm behavior on an HA router under various network conditions.  The tests involve manipulating a "kniTest" interface on a router (DUT3), simulating network disruptions (dropping conductor traffic), and verifying expected alarms.  The tests are tagged `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel`, suggesting they are part of a nightly regression suite, possibly for RHEL.

The most substantial changes center around the `Keywords` section, specifically the `Verify Current Alarms` and related keywords.  Early versions lacked a dedicated `expected_alarms` list, with the `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms` keyword potentially handling all alarm checks.  Later revisions introduce  `Get Connectivity Alarms List For Partial Conductor Connectivity On` and `Get Connectivity Alarms List For No Conductor Connectivity On`, indicating a move towards more precise alarm verification based on specific network scenarios.  This involved creating separate lists for expected and ignored alarms, refining the alarm verification process. The `Append Default Password Alarms To` keyword consistently handles ignoring default password alarms across all versions.  There's also a notable addition of detailed alarm dictionary creation within keywords (`Get Expected Alarms List`,  `Get Connectivity Alarms List`), providing richer information about the expected alarms' message, category, severity, and location (router and node).  Finally, the last revision added a `Return From Keyword If` condition to the `Check For Default Password Alarms` keyword, improving efficiency by exiting early if no such alarms are found.  The `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` with a timeout of 3m 30s is consistently used throughout to allow time for network changes and alarm propagation.  The use of global variables like `ALL_DEVICES` and `DUT3_LINUX_CONN` for managing devices and Linux connections remains consistent.


## 3:12:48 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` file and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot` file between 2:17:45 PM and 2:55:59 PM on February 21, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the Robot Framework test suite for verifying alarms on an HA router.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` file underwent multiple revisions.  The initial version (2:17:45 PM) contained test cases that verified alarm counts under various network conditions (e.g.,  dropping conductor traffic partially or completely, enabling/disabling kniTest interface).  These test cases used keywords for verifying connectivity, managing the kniTest interface on DUT3, and checking for expected and ignored alarms.

Subsequent revisions (2:34:40 PM, 2:35:42 PM, 2:37:01 PM, 2:37:13 PM, 2:39:28 PM, 2:51:27 PM, 2:54:57 PM, 2:55:59 PM) focused on minor adjustments:

* **Variable Definition:** The way the `@{ALL_DEVICES}` variable was defined changed from using the `Create List` keyword to a direct assignment of the list elements.  This simplification occurred around 2:35 PM.
* **Keyword Refactoring:**  The `Append Default Password Alarms To` keyword, initially within `AlarmHA.robot`, was moved to a new file `AlarmCommon.robot` (2:49:56 PM), improving code organization and reusability.  The `AlarmHA.robot` file was then updated to use this new resource. The `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword was further simplified by removing the `To` from the keyword's name.


The modifications show a consistent pattern of improving the test suite's structure and maintainability without altering the core functionality of the test cases themselves. The 3m 30s timeout in `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` is consistently used across many keywords, suggesting a standard wait period for various operations.  The repeated use of `DUT1`, `DUT2`, `DUT3`, and `DUT4` indicates a test environment involving four devices (DUTS). The tests extensively manipulate the `kniTest` interface, suggesting a key component of the system under test.


## 5:13:27 PM
The log shows numerous updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot` and several other Robot Framework test files between 3:16 PM and 4:52 PM on February 21, 2025.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot` file underwent several revisions, primarily focused on the `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword.  Initial versions lacked explicit handling of keyword failures. Later versions added error handling using `Run Keyword And Ignore Error`, checking for the keyword's success or failure and conditionally appending default password alarms to the input alarm list.  The final version included better comments explaining the logic and improved variable handling.  These changes were made in rapid succession, indicating active development and debugging.

The other Robot Framework test files (`SpirentHACapacity.robot`, `Bgp.robot`, `BgpVrf.robot`, `ConductorHATest.robot`, `ConductorServiceFailoverTest.robot`, and `RouterMaintenanceMode.robot`, `DHCP/BasicDhcpHA.robot`, `IDP/SRXContainer.robot`, `RappidDirector/RappidApplications.robot`, `Vrrp/VrrpAlarm.robot`) showcase various test cases related to system functionalities including:  Spirent HA capacity testing (upgrade/rollback scenarios with traffic sampling), BGP functionality (route advertisement, graceful restart, BFD interaction), VRF configurations and reachability, HA conductor and router synchronization tests,  conductor service failover, router maintenance mode and alarm shelving, DHCP HA failover, IDP container management (cSRX), and Rappid Director application management. A recurring pattern is the extensive use of  keywords such as `Verify Alarms`, `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds`, and the use of  `Create Dictionary` and `Append To List` keywords, suggesting a structured approach to managing alarms and test data.  Multiple test cases in different files utilize the `AlarmCommon.robot` resource file, demonstrating its importance for alarm handling across diverse testing scenarios.  Many tests include tags like `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel`, suggesting a nightly test suite execution. The `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword in `AlarmCommon.robot` is consistently used across many test files to manage default password alarms, indicating a common concern in the test suite.
