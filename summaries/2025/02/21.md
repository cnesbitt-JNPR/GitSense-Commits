# Activity Summary for 2/21/2025

## 10:12:49 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Robot Framework test suite (`AlarmHA.robot`) and a Python library (`AlarmHandlerLib.py`) focused on alarm handling and verification.  The most significant changes occur in `AlarmHA.robot`.

**AlarmHandlerLib.py (2/21/2025, 9:16:12 AM):** This file defines a Python library for handling alarms.  It includes classes for representing alarms (`Alarm`), managing their status (`ShelvedStatus`), and several functions for retrieving alarms based on various criteria (all alarms, current alarms, shelved alarms, alarms within a specific time range, and alarms related to default passwords).  The library uses REST API calls (`RestLib`) to fetch alarm data.  The `Alarm` class provides methods for accessing alarm attributes, comparing alarms, and converting them to dictionaries.  The functions use `use_legacy_parameters` and `use_top_level_alarm_endpoint` flags for flexibility in API interaction. The `verify_all_alarms` function allows for comparison of retrieved alarms against expected and ignored alarms.

**AlarmHA.robot (Multiple Revisions):** This Robot Framework test suite undergoes several revisions between 9:27 AM and 10:06 AM.  The core functionality remains consistent: verifying alarm counts and states on an HA router under various network conditions (e.g., dropping network traffic to simulate connectivity issues). The test suite uses the `AlarmHandlerLib` library extensively.

* **Early Revisions (9:27 AM and 9:35 AM):** The initial revisions primarily focus on setting up the test environment, defining variables (like `${KNI_INTF_NAME}`, `${USE_LEGACY_PARAMS}`, `${USE_TOP_ALARM_ENDPOINT}`), and establishing the test cases.  The test cases involve manipulating network interfaces (`Add Kni Interface`, `Set ... Interface ... To Enabled`, `Delete Kni Interface`), inducing network issues, and verifying the presence or absence of specific alarms using `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms` and variations thereof.  These versions show an evolution in the `Verify ... Alarms` keywords, refining how expected and ignored alarms are handled, and adding logging for debugging purposes.

* **Later Revisions (9:44 AM and 10:06 AM):**  The later revisions demonstrate a refinement in the handling of default password alarms. The `Append Default Password Alarms To` keyword and its usage within the test cases become more prominent.  The keyword `Get Default Password Alarms` is used to collect these specific alarms.  The for loop iterating over password alarms to create dictionaries is refined for better readability and handling of potential index errors.  A pattern emerges where alarms are consistently compared against expected and ignored lists (`expected_alarms`, `ignored_alarms`).

In summary, the code evolution demonstrates a systematic approach to building a robust test suite for verifying alarm functionality in a network environment. The changes show a progression from establishing basic test cases to handling edge cases (default password alarms) and improving code readability and error handling.  The consistent use of  `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` indicates a focus on reliable test execution despite potential delays in the system under test.


## 11:12:48 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` underwent several revisions on February 21, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent throughoutâ€”verifying alarm counts on an HA router under various network conditions.  The changes primarily involved refinements to keyword definitions, specifically within the `Keywords` section.

Early revisions (10:15:53 AM, 10:16:38 AM, 10:22:24 AM, 10:24:45 AM) show minor inconsistencies in how `Append Default Password Alarms To` was used within the keywords, sometimes using `@{alarms}` and other times `${alarms}`.  These were likely minor syntax errors corrected in later commits.

A significant change occurred between 10:27:08 AM and 10:27:15 AM.  The `Append Default Password Alarms To` keyword usage was standardized to use `${alarms}`. Furthermore, the `Get Default Password Alarms` keyword was introduced, improving code clarity and potentially efficiency by separating the password alarm retrieval logic.


A final key change happened between 10:28:04 AM and 10:41:56 AM.  The `Set Variable` keyword replaced the `Set Variable` keyword within the loop in `Check For Default Password Alarms`, a small but potentially important change for variable handling.

The latest revisions (10:56:24 AM and 10:57:37 AM) further refined the keyword section. Notably,  `@{ignored_alarms}` is consistently initialized with `Create List` and then populated using `Append Default Password Alarms To` in multiple keywords, which demonstrates a commitment to consistent coding style and better maintainability. The `Get Expected Alarms List` keyword was also truncated, implying a potential refactoring of this logic.  The final version at 10:57:37 AM shows the keyword ending abruptly, indicating that it is incomplete and likely needs further work.


Throughout all revisions, the test cases remained largely unchanged. They consistently tested alarm behavior with varying degrees of connectivity to conductor nodes (full connectivity, half connectivity, and no connectivity), using the `kniTest` interface.  The `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` tags suggest these are regularly run integration tests.  The file consistently uses a `four_duts` topology defined in `topologies/four_duts/ConductorHAToComboHA.robot`.
