# Activity Summary for 2/24/2025

## 10:03:36 AM
The Robot Framework test script `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/topologies/large/TwoVrfsOneHAGateway.robot` (last updated 2/24/2025, 9:04:52 AM) defines a complex network topology involving six devices (DUT1-DUT6).  DUT1 is a Conductor, DUT2 and DUT3 form an HA gateway router, and DUT4, DUT5, and DUT6 are combo devices (DUT6 unmanaged). The topology simulates two customer VRFs (A and B) communicating with a BNG (DUT6) over separate VLANs (111 and 112), and includes Spirent test equipment and internet connectivity.

The script extensively uses variables to define IP addresses, VLANs, BGP parameters (AS numbers, keepalive intervals, etc.), and device-specific configurations.  These variables are grouped by device (DUT1-DUT6), providing structured access to device settings like management IPs, PCI addresses, roles (conductor, combo), and local/internet/VLAN IPs.  There is a consistent naming pattern for variables relating to each DUT (e.g., `DUTx_MGMT`, `DUTx_PCI_y`, `DUTx_ROLE`).  The configuration also includes details about security settings (AES, HMAC), service definitions for different LANs, access policies, and source NAT configurations.  The script thoroughly documents the topology via comments.  A key aspect is the setup of multiple services with associated access policies and source NAT configurations related to CustomerSite4 and CustomerSite5 interactions with the gateway via internet and MPLS VPN.
