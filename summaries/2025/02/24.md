# Activity Summary for 2/24/2025

## 10:03:36 AM
The Robot Framework test script `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/topologies/large/TwoVrfsOneHAGateway.robot` (last updated 2/24/2025, 9:04:52 AM) defines a complex network topology involving six devices (DUT1-DUT6).  DUT1 is a Conductor, DUT2 and DUT3 form an HA gateway router, and DUT4, DUT5, and DUT6 are combo devices (DUT6 unmanaged). The topology simulates two customer VRFs (A and B) communicating with a BNG (DUT6) over separate VLANs (111 and 112), and includes Spirent test equipment and internet connectivity.

The script extensively uses variables to define IP addresses, VLANs, BGP parameters (AS numbers, keepalive intervals, etc.), and device-specific configurations.  These variables are grouped by device (DUT1-DUT6), providing structured access to device settings like management IPs, PCI addresses, roles (conductor, combo), and local/internet/VLAN IPs.  There is a consistent naming pattern for variables relating to each DUT (e.g., `DUTx_MGMT`, `DUTx_PCI_y`, `DUTx_ROLE`).  The configuration also includes details about security settings (AES, HMAC), service definitions for different LANs, access policies, and source NAT configurations.  The script thoroughly documents the topology via comments.  A key aspect is the setup of multiple services with associated access policies and source NAT configurations related to CustomerSite4 and CustomerSite5 interactions with the gateway via internet and MPLS VPN.

The log shows three nearly identical revisions of the Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot`.  The changes between revisions are minimal and not reflected in the provided code snippets.  All three revisions share the same content at the time of logging.


The test suite is designed to test SNMP functionality within a 128T system. It utilizes numerous libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, `T128`) and resources (`TestbedStore`, `MibDefinitions`, `SnmpCommon`, `BaseSuiteVariables`).


The test cases cover various aspects of SNMP:

* **SNMPv2 Host MIB Sanity Test:** Verifies basic SNMPv2-MIB objects (`sysObjectID`, `sysLocation`).
* **T128 System Mib Basic Objects:**  Tests retrieval of basic scalar objects from the T128-SYSTEM-MIB.
* **T128 System Mib Process Table:** Checks objects within the T128-SYSTEM-MIB Process table.
* **Snmp Get Table IfTable:** Verifies data from the IF-MIB::ifTable, including interface speed, MAC address, and statistics (octets, packets).  It accounts for different interface speeds (1Gb/s or 10Gb/s).
* **T128 Alarm Mib Alarm Tables:**  Tests the retrieval of data from the T128-ALARM-MIB Alarm and ShelvedAlarm tables, involving manipulating maintenance mode and interface status.
* **T128 Metrics Mib Metrics Table:** Verifies data from the T128-METRICS-MIB Metrics table.
* **Receive Alarm Trap:**  Tests the reception of SNMP traps related to interface admin status changes (with and without shelving), including a `Sleep 60s` for trap agent connection.
* **Receive ifDown and ifUp Traps:** (Incomplete in the provided log)  Indicates further testing of SNMP trap reception for interface status changes.


A recurring pattern is the use of `Get Snmp Object` and `Snmp Get Table` keywords to interact with the SNMP agent, followed by numerous `Should Be Equal` and `Should Be Within` assertions to validate the retrieved data.  The test cases are tagged with `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins`, suggesting a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.  The timestamp of the revisions suggests that multiple commits were made in quick succession.
