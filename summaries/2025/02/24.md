# Activity Summary for 2/24/2025

## 10:03:36 AM
The Robot Framework test script `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/topologies/large/TwoVrfsOneHAGateway.robot` (last updated 2/24/2025, 9:04:52 AM) defines a complex network topology involving six devices (DUT1-DUT6).  DUT1 is a Conductor, DUT2 and DUT3 form an HA gateway router, and DUT4, DUT5, and DUT6 are combo devices (DUT6 unmanaged). The topology simulates two customer VRFs (A and B) communicating with a BNG (DUT6) over separate VLANs (111 and 112), and includes Spirent test equipment and internet connectivity.

The script extensively uses variables to define IP addresses, VLANs, BGP parameters (AS numbers, keepalive intervals, etc.), and device-specific configurations.  These variables are grouped by device (DUT1-DUT6), providing structured access to device settings like management IPs, PCI addresses, roles (conductor, combo), and local/internet/VLAN IPs.  There is a consistent naming pattern for variables relating to each DUT (e.g., `DUTx_MGMT`, `DUTx_PCI_y`, `DUTx_ROLE`).  The configuration also includes details about security settings (AES, HMAC), service definitions for different LANs, access policies, and source NAT configurations.  The script thoroughly documents the topology via comments.  A key aspect is the setup of multiple services with associated access policies and source NAT configurations related to CustomerSite4 and CustomerSite5 interactions with the gateway via internet and MPLS VPN.

The log shows three nearly identical revisions of the Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot`.  The changes between revisions are minimal and not reflected in the provided code snippets.  All three revisions share the same content at the time of logging.


The test suite is designed to test SNMP functionality within a 128T system. It utilizes numerous libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, `T128`) and resources (`TestbedStore`, `MibDefinitions`, `SnmpCommon`, `BaseSuiteVariables`).


The test cases cover various aspects of SNMP:

* **SNMPv2 Host MIB Sanity Test:** Verifies basic SNMPv2-MIB objects (`sysObjectID`, `sysLocation`).
* **T128 System Mib Basic Objects:**  Tests retrieval of basic scalar objects from the T128-SYSTEM-MIB.
* **T128 System Mib Process Table:** Checks objects within the T128-SYSTEM-MIB Process table.
* **Snmp Get Table IfTable:** Verifies data from the IF-MIB::ifTable, including interface speed, MAC address, and statistics (octets, packets).  It accounts for different interface speeds (1Gb/s or 10Gb/s).
* **T128 Alarm Mib Alarm Tables:**  Tests the retrieval of data from the T128-ALARM-MIB Alarm and ShelvedAlarm tables, involving manipulating maintenance mode and interface status.
* **T128 Metrics Mib Metrics Table:** Verifies data from the T128-METRICS-MIB Metrics table.
* **Receive Alarm Trap:**  Tests the reception of SNMP traps related to interface admin status changes (with and without shelving), including a `Sleep 60s` for trap agent connection.
* **Receive ifDown and ifUp Traps:** (Incomplete in the provided log)  Indicates further testing of SNMP trap reception for interface status changes.


A recurring pattern is the use of `Get Snmp Object` and `Snmp Get Table` keywords to interact with the SNMP agent, followed by numerous `Should Be Equal` and `Should Be Within` assertions to validate the retrieved data.  The test cases are tagged with `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins`, suggesting a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.  The timestamp of the revisions suggests that multiple commits were made in quick succession.


## 12:04:05 PM
The provided log shows two revisions of the Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot`.  Both revisions are identical in content. The only difference is the timestamp, indicating a possible backup or unintentional duplicate entry. The file contains numerous test cases related to SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) functionality, specifically testing various MIBs (Management Information Bases) on a 128T system.

The test suite utilizes several custom Robot Framework libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, `T128`) and resources (`TestbedStore`, `MibDefinitions`, `SnmpCommon`, `BaseSuiteVariables`).  Test cases cover:

* **SNMPv2 Host MIB Sanity Test:** Checks basic SNMPv2 functionality and object retrieval.
* **T128 System MIB Basic Objects:** Verifies T128-SYSTEM-MIB scalar objects (router name, node name, role, asset ID).
* **T128 System MIB Process Table:** Tests retrieval and verification of data from the T128-SYSTEM-MIB Process table.
* **SNMP Get Table IfTable:**  A comprehensive test focusing on the IF-MIB::ifTable, checking various interface parameters (index, description, type, MTU, speed, physical address, admin/oper status, counters, etc.). This includes handling of potentially large interface speeds according to RFC2863.
* **T128 Alarm MIB Alarm Tables:** Tests the retrieval of alarm data from T128-ALARM-MIB tables, including verification of alarm and shelved alarm entries after triggering an interface administrative down event.
* **T128 Metrics MIB Metrics Table:** Tests data retrieval from the T128-METRICS-MIB Metrics table.
* **Receive Alarm Trap:**  Tests the reception of SNMP traps upon interface down/up events, verifying both shelved and unshelved trap status. This test includes a `Sleep 60s` which is noted as a TODO item for removal.
* **Receive ifDown and ifUp Traps:**  Indicates another test for SNMP trap reception on interface state changes.


The tests heavily rely on variables such as `${DUT1_SNMP}`, `${DUT1_ROUTER}`, `${DUT1_NODE_NAME}`, `${DUT1_ASSET_ID}`, and `${TEST_IF}` (likely representing a specific device and interface under test).  The tests consistently use keywords like `Get Snmp Object`, `Snmp Get Table`, and `Get Next Snmp Object` to interact with the SNMP agent. The timestamps of both entries are on February 24th, 2025, with a difference of only 6 minutes, suggesting a possible redundancy in the log.


## 2:04:03 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` underwent a minor revision between 1:41:50 PM and 2:00:28 PM on February 24, 2025.  The change involved a single modification within the `T128 Alarm Mib Alarm Tables` test case. Specifically, the line  `${response}= Get Next Snmp Object ${DUT1_SNMP} T128-ALARM-MIB::t128AlarmTableCategory` was updated to include a `.1` index, becoming `${response}= Get Next Snmp Object ${DUT1_SNMP} T128-ALARM-MIB::t128AlarmTableCategory.1`.  The rest of the file's content remained identical. The update suggests a correction to correctly access the SNMP table using the index.  The overall structure and purpose of the test suite, encompassing SNMP testing across various MIBs (SNMPv2-MIB, T128-SYSTEM-MIB, T128-ALARM-MIB, T128-METRICS-MIB, and IF-MIB),  remained unchanged.  The test cases consistently use tags like `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins`, indicating a standardized testing and CI/CD pipeline.
