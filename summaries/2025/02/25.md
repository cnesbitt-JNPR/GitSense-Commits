# Activity Summary for 2/25/2025

## 10:04:07 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` file between 9:14 AM and 9:57 AM on February 25, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be on refining and simplifying the `Verify Default Password Alarm Is Cleared When Updating Password` test case.

Initially, this test case was quite extensive, involving multiple password changes for various users, clock adjustments using `date` command, and restarting node monitors.  Subsequent edits progressively removed unnecessary steps, such as changing passwords for users other than "admin," and streamlining the clock synchronization.  The final version at 9:57 AM shows a significantly more concise test concentrating solely on the essential steps to verify the clearing of the default password alarm for the "admin" user.  The changes also introduced a `Create Password Alarm Test Variables` keyword, likely aiming for better organization and code maintainability.

Throughout the modifications, the libraries and resources included in the `*** Settings ***` section remained consistent, indicating a stable testing environment setup.  The test cases related to verifying alarm counts under various network conditions ("Verify Alarm Count On HA Router," etc.) showed no substantial structural changes, suggesting their functionality was not the primary focus of these edits. The repeated use of `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds 3m 30s ...` across various tests implies a consistent time allowance for actions to complete.  Keywords like `Verify Stable Connectivity`, `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms`, and those related to manipulating network traffic ('Drop Half Conductor Traffic,' etc.) were consistently used, indicative of a well-defined testing methodology for network stability and alarm checks.  The use of  `Run Keyword And Ignore Error` in several keywords suggests that certain operations, potentially related to network interface manipulation, are expected to sometimes fail without impacting the overall test execution.
