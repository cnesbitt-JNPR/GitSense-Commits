# Activity Summary for 2/25/2025

## 10:04:07 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` file between 9:14 AM and 9:57 AM on February 25, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be on refining and simplifying the `Verify Default Password Alarm Is Cleared When Updating Password` test case.

Initially, this test case was quite extensive, involving multiple password changes for various users, clock adjustments using `date` command, and restarting node monitors.  Subsequent edits progressively removed unnecessary steps, such as changing passwords for users other than "admin," and streamlining the clock synchronization.  The final version at 9:57 AM shows a significantly more concise test concentrating solely on the essential steps to verify the clearing of the default password alarm for the "admin" user.  The changes also introduced a `Create Password Alarm Test Variables` keyword, likely aiming for better organization and code maintainability.

Throughout the modifications, the libraries and resources included in the `*** Settings ***` section remained consistent, indicating a stable testing environment setup.  The test cases related to verifying alarm counts under various network conditions ("Verify Alarm Count On HA Router," etc.) showed no substantial structural changes, suggesting their functionality was not the primary focus of these edits. The repeated use of `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds 3m 30s ...` across various tests implies a consistent time allowance for actions to complete.  Keywords like `Verify Stable Connectivity`, `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms`, and those related to manipulating network traffic ('Drop Half Conductor Traffic,' etc.) were consistently used, indicative of a well-defined testing methodology for network stability and alarm checks.  The use of  `Run Keyword And Ignore Error` in several keywords suggests that certain operations, potentially related to network interface manipulation, are expected to sometimes fail without impacting the overall test execution.


## 11:04:05 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` file between 10:06 AM and 10:34 AM on February 25, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor edits and do not affect the core functionality of the Robot Framework test suite.  The suite uses several libraries (`AlarmHandlerLib`, `LinuxLib`, `NodeConnectivity`, `SSHLib`, `SystemRegistry`, `SystemTunnels`, `T128`) and resources (`AlarmCommon`, `TestbedStore`, `BaseSuiteVariables`) for testing alarms on an HA router, specifically focusing on password changes and connectivity verification.


The `Verify Default Password Alarm Is Cleared When Updating Password` test case is the main focus, involving password changes for multiple users (`Admin`, `root`, `t128`, `centos`) on an HA combo node.  The test uses `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` with a 3-minute 30-second timeout for several verification steps, indicating a reliance on asynchronous operations.  The keywords extensively use variables like `${DUT1}`, `${DUT2}`, `${DUT3}`, `${DUT4}`  (presumably representing different devices under test), `${DUT3_LINUX_CONN}`, `${DUT3_ROUTER}`, and `${DUT3_NODE_NAME}` suggesting a multi-device test environment.


The keywords `Get Connectivity Alarms List For Partial Conductor Connectivity On` and `Get Connectivity Alarms List For No Conductor Connectivity On` are utilized multiple times, implying repeated checks for connectivity-related alarms under various conditions.  The consistent use of `Append Default Password Alarms` to the `${ignored_alarms}` list points to a strategy of handling expected default password alarms.  No significant structural changes are observed in the code across the revisions.  The timestamps indicate a period of active editing and debugging, with several minor commits within a relatively short time frame.


## 1:04:03 PM
The code implements a `PasswordSecurityScanner` class in C++ that checks for users with default passwords in the `/etc/shadow` file.  The class, part of a larger node monitoring system,  periodically scans the shadow file (the timing is configurable). It targets specific usernames (`admin`, `t128`, `root`, `centos`) and a predefined list of default passwords.


The `scanShadowFileForViolations` function reads the `/etc/shadow` file, parses each line using regular expressions to extract usernames and passwords.  It then uses the `doesUserHaveDefaultPassword` function to verify if a password matches any of the default passwords. This verification involves resolving the hash algorithm used (SHA256 or SHA512), parsing the salt and hash from the encrypted password and comparing it against hashes of the default passwords.

Detected violations (users with default passwords) are collected and stored in a `dolly::dynamic` object, intended to be written to a state object (although this functionality is currently stubbed out with a placeholder DebugLog).  The code extensively uses logging for debugging purposes.  The timestamp of the code is 2/25/2025, 12:55:51 PM.  The code includes several TODO comments indicating ongoing development or features awaiting merging from other branches.  Error handling is included for file reading failures.
