# Activity Summary for 2/26/2025

## 10:03:30 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` underwent updates on February 26, 2025, at 9:42:22 AM.  The changes primarily involve additions and modifications to SNMP tests focusing on various MIBs (Management Information Bases): SNMPv2-MIB, T128-SYSTEM-MIB, IF-MIB, and T128-ALARM-MIB.

**File-Specific Updates:**

The `SnmpSuite.robot` file shows extensive testing of SNMP functionalities.  The tests cover:

* **SNMPv2-MIB Sanity Check:** Verifies basic SNMPv2 object retrieval and value comparison against expected results.
* **T128 System MIB:** Tests retrieval of scalar objects (like router name, node name, role, asset ID) from the T128-SYSTEM-MIB.
* **T128 System MIB Process Table:**  Verifies data retrieval from the process table, checking object names and values.
* **IF-MIB Table:**  Thoroughly tests the retrieval and validation of data from the IF-MIB interface table, including various interface statistics (octets, packets, errors, etc.) with comparisons against expected values derived from other metrics.  Noteworthy is the handling of different interface speeds (1Gb/s or 10Gb/s).
* **T128 Alarm MIB:** Tests the alarm management functionality by triggering an interface alarm, verifying its state (active/shelved), and checking corresponding entries in the T128-ALARM-MIB tables.  Includes steps to configure maintenance mode and wait for alarms to trigger and be shelved.  The test explicitly checks for expected alarm messages and compares them with the values obtained from the SNMP requests.
* **T128 Metrics MIB:**  Includes an incomplete test case for verifying data from the T128-METRICS-MIB table.


**Recurring Elements:**

The tests consistently use the `Get Snmp Object` and `Snmp Get Table` keywords, along with numerous `Should Be Equal` and `Should Be Within` assertions for validation.  Many test cases are tagged with `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins`, suggesting a nightly automated testing process linked to continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.  The tests rely heavily on variables like `${DUT1_SNMP}`, `${DUT1_ROUTER}`, `${DUT1_NODE_NAME}`, and `${DUT1_ASSET_ID}`, indicating parameterized testing across different devices or configurations.  There are also references to helper libraries (e.g., `SNMPLib.py`, `CliLib.py`) that manage the lower-level interactions with the SNMP agent and CLI.


**Significant Changes:**

The most significant change is the comprehensive addition of tests related to SNMP alarm handling and validation (T128 Alarm MIB section), including explicit checks for alarm shelving due to maintenance mode.  The IF-MIB table test is also quite substantial, demonstrating a more detailed verification of interface statistics.  The commented-out code section near the end suggests a cleanup effort targeting unused functions within `SNMPLib.py`.


## 12:05:08 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` underwent several revisions on February 26, 2025.  The changes primarily involved modifications to the `T128 Alarm Mib Alarm Tables` test case.  Initially, this test case used `Get Next Snmp Object` repeatedly to verify specific alarm table entries.  Between 11:04 AM and 11:09 AM, no changes were made to the code.  Later revisions, starting around 11:22 AM, significantly altered the test case by introducing the keywords `Find Active Intf Alarm Index` and `Find Shelved Intf Alarm Index`. These keywords were added to dynamically find alarm indices, making the test more robust and less reliant on static OID values. The final version, around 11:45 AM and 11:46 AM, further refined this approach by incorporating the index into the `Get Next Snmp Object` calls, indicating a complete transition to a more dynamic and flexible testing method. All other test cases remained unchanged throughout these revisions.


A separate Robot Framework test suite, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot`, was also modified at 11:57 AM on February 26, 2025.  This suite focuses on High Availability (HA) router alarm verification.  The update involved adding a new test case,  `Verify Default Password Alarm Is Cleared When Updating Password`, demonstrating a focus on password management related alarms.  This test case includes steps for restarting node monitors to force state updates, updating passwords for various users (root, t128, centos), and then verifying that password-related alarms clear as expected. The keywords `Setup Alarm HA Suite` and `Teardown Alarm HA Suite` were defined to manage setup and teardown tasks across the suite, streamlining the test execution process.  Other existing test cases focused on verifying alarm counts in different network states (full connectivity, partial connectivity, no connectivity) with regards to the HA router and other devices. The overall changes in this file show an enhancement of the testing process by using helper keywords.


## 2:03:28 PM
The Robot Framework test suite logs show modifications to two files: `SnmpSuite.robot` and `AlarmHA.robot`.  The changes to `SnmpSuite.robot` occurred between 1:30:09 PM and 1:31:29 PM on February 26, 2025, with no substantial differences in content across the multiple timestamps. This file contains test cases focused on SNMP functionality within a 128T system.  The tests extensively utilize the `Get Snmp Object` and `Snmp Get Table` keywords to retrieve and verify data from various MIBs (SNMPv2-MIB, T128-SYSTEM-MIB, T128-ALARM-MIB, T128-METRICS-MIB, and IF-MIB).  Multiple test cases validate specific object values, including sysObjectID, sysLocation, router name, node name, node role, asset ID, process table entries, ifTable entries, and metrics table entries.  There are also tests focused on receiving alarm traps, both shelved and unshelved, following interface manipulation.  The `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins` tags suggest these tests are part of a continuous integration pipeline.

The `AlarmHA.robot` file was modified at 1:32:26 PM on February 26, 2025.  This file contains test cases designed to verify alarm behavior on a High Availability (HA) router.  It uses keywords like `Wait For Stable Connectivity Between All Duts`, `Add Kni Interface`, `Set ... Interface ... To Enabled`, `Delete Kni Interface`, `Verify Admin Down Alarm`, and `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms`. The test cases systematically manipulate network interfaces (specifically a `kniTest` interface), trigger alarms, and then verify the expected alarm counts.  The tests cover scenarios involving partial and complete loss of connectivity to conductor nodes and also verify that default password alarms are cleared when passwords are updated.  Similar to `SnmpSuite.robot`,  `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` tags are present.


## 3:03:28 PM
The Robot Framework test suite logs show modifications to two test suite files (`SnmpSuite.robot` and `AlarmHA.robot`) on February 26, 2025.  

The `SnmpSuite.robot` file underwent multiple revisions between 2:17 PM and 2:50 PM.  These revisions did not change the overall structure or test cases; instead, the code remained consistent across all three timestamps. The file focuses on testing SNMP functionality, including checks against SNMPv2-MIB, T128-SYSTEM-MIB, IF-MIB, T128-ALARM-MIB, and T128-METRICS-MIB.  The tests extensively use keywords like `Get Snmp Object`, `Snmp Get Table`, and custom keywords for interacting with interfaces, metrics, and alarms.  Many test cases are tagged with `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins`, suggesting a regular automated testing process.  A recurring theme is the verification of specific OIDs and values from different MIBs.  There's also a `TODO` comment about removing a sleep statement related to trap agent connection.

The `AlarmHA.robot` file was modified at 2:59 PM. This file tests alarm handling on a high-availability (HA) router using a four-DUT topology. The test cases systematically verify alarm counts under various scenarios, including network connectivity issues and password changes.  It uses keywords related to interface manipulation (`Add Kni Interface`, `Delete Kni Interface`), alarm verification (`Verify Admin Down Alarm`), and connectivity checks (`Wait For Stable Connectivity Between All Duts`).  The suite utilizes a significant number of `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` calls, indicating a tolerance for delays in the system under test.  The `Teardown` section is meticulously designed to cleanup after each test.  Variables, such as `${TOPOLOGY_DEFINITION_FILE}`, `${KNI_INTF_NAME}`, and others, are used for configuration and DUT identification.


## 4:03:29 PM
The log shows Robot Framework test suite updates across three timestamps.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` file, modified at 3:14:35 PM on February 26, 2025, contains test cases focused on verifying alarm behavior on an HA router under various network connectivity scenarios (dropping conductor traffic, manipulating KNI interfaces).  These tests extensively use keywords for connectivity checks and alarm verification.  The recurring theme is verifying alarm counts and states after inducing specific network changes.  A test also verifies that default password alarms are cleared after password updates, involving restarting node monitors to ensure state updates.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` file underwent two updates: one at 3:39:38 PM and another at 3:40:23 PM on the same day. Both revisions contain numerous SNMP tests.  The tests verify various aspects of SNMP functionality, including:

* **Sanity checks:** verifying basic SNMP object retrieval against expected values from the `SNMPv2-MIB` and `T128-SYSTEM-MIB`.
* **Table retrieval:** verifying data obtained from SNMP tables like `IF-MIB::ifTable`, `T128-SYSTEM-MIB::t128ProcessTable`, and `T128-METRICS-MIB::t128MetricsTable`.  These checks compare retrieved data against expected values and ranges (e.g., interface speed and received/sent bytes).
* **Alarm handling:** verifying alarm states and retrieval using `T128-ALARM-MIB` objects, including shelved alarms.  Maintenance mode is manipulated to trigger and shelf alarms.
* **Trap reception:** tests for receiving SNMP traps (`Expect Received T128 Network Trap Admin Down`) upon interface bouncing, differentiating between shelved and unshelved traps.

The later update (4:00:33 PM) added `Log` keywords to print the values of `${index}` variables before some SNMP object retrievals within the Alarm MIB tests, suggesting debugging efforts or logging enhancements. The consistent use of tags like `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins` indicates a structured testing process involving nightly builds and continuous integration.  The file uses various custom keywords from libraries such as `SNMPLib`, `CliLib`, and `AlarmHandlerLib`.


## 5:03:29 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Robot Framework test suite (`SnmpSuite.robot`) for testing SNMP functionality within a 128T system.  No changes were made to the file content across the revisions. The file consistently uses numerous libraries (`InitRobot.py`, `AlarmHandlerLib.py`, `CliLib.py`, `CommonLib.py`, `LinuxDevices.py`, `LinuxLib.py`, `Timeseries.py`, `SNMPLib.py`, `SSHLib.py`, `T128.py`) and resources (`TestbedStore.robot`, `AlarmCommon.robot`, `MibDefinitions.robot`, `SnmpCommon.robot`, `BaseSuiteVariables.robot`).  The test suite tests various aspects of SNMP, including:

* **SNMPv2 Host MIB Sanity Test:** Verifying basic SNMPv2 objects like `sysObjectID` and `sysLocation`.
* **T128 System MIB Tests:**  Testing different T128-SYSTEM-MIB objects, including scalar objects (`t128RouterName`, `t128NodeName`, `t128NodeRole`, `t128AssetId`) and the `t128ProcessTable`.
* **IF-MIB Table Test:**  Comprehensive testing of the `IF-MIB::ifTable`, validating numerous interface attributes (index, description, type, MTU, speed, physical address, admin/oper status, statistics etc.).  It handles different interface speeds (1Gb/s and 10Gb/s) correctly.
* **T128 Alarm MIB Tests:** Testing the T128-ALARM-MIB alarm tables, including triggering alarms, shelving them using maintenance mode, and verifying the shelved and unshelved alarm entries.
* **T128 Metrics MIB Tests:** Testing the T128-METRICS-MIB metrics table, verifying the `t128MetricsTable` entries.
* **SNMP Trap Reception:** Testing the reception of SNMP traps (Admin Down) when an interface is bounced, both with and without shelving, with a 60-second sleep before the test (potentially for trap agent connection establishment).  A TODO comment indicates that this sleep should be replaced with a proper connection check.


The timestamps indicate multiple saves of the file (4:05:01 PM, 4:05:26 PM, 4:36:49 PM, and 4:55:05 PM on February 26, 2025), but the content remained identical in all revisions.  This suggests the changes might be related to version control, or perhaps the timestamps are inaccurate,  but no actual code modification happened between the recorded revision times.  The recurring elements are the consistent use of libraries, resources and the tags `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins` across all test cases, suggesting a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is used.


## 6:03:29 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` (last updated 2/26/2025, 5:16:59 PM)  tests SNMP functionality on a 128T system.  It uses numerous custom libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, `T128`) and resource files (`TestbedStore`, `AlarmCommon`, `MibDefinitions`, `SnmpCommon`, `BaseSuiteVariables`).

The suite contains multiple test cases focusing on different aspects of SNMP:

* **SNMPv2 Host MIB Sanity Test:** Verifies basic SNMPv2-MIB objects (`sysObjectID`, `sysLocation`).
* **T128 System Mib Basic Objects:** Checks T128-SYSTEM-MIB scalar objects (`t128RouterName`, `t128NodeName`, `t128NodeRole`, `t128AssetId`).
* **T128 System Mib Process Table:** Tests retrieval and verification of data from the T128-SYSTEM-MIB Process table.
* **Snmp Get Table IfTable:**  Extensively tests the IF-MIB::ifTable, verifying numerous interface attributes (index, description, type, MTU, speed, physical address, admin/oper status, various counters). It dynamically handles different interface speeds (1Gb/s or 10Gb/s).  The test also cross-references SNMP data with metrics obtained through `/stats/interface/received/bytes` and `/stats/interface/sent/bytes`.
* **T128 Alarm Mib Alarm Tables:** Verifies data from the T128-ALARM-MIB Alarm and ShelvedAlarm tables, involving the manipulation of interface status and maintenance mode to trigger alarms.
* **T128 Metrics Mib Metrics Table:**  Tests the T128-METRICS-MIB Metrics table.
* **Receive Alarm Trap:** Tests the reception of SNMP traps (admin down) with and without shelving, involving interface manipulation and a wait period to ensure trap reception.  This test also includes a placeholder TODO to remove a sleep.


Many tests share common tags like `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins`, suggesting a continuous integration and testing workflow.  The tests consistently use keywords like `Get Snmp Object`, `Snmp Get Table`,  and leverage variables like `${DUT1_SNMP}`, `${DUT1_ROUTER}`, `${DUT1_NODE_NAME}`, `${DUT1_ASSET_ID}`, and `${TEST_IF}` (likely representing a device under test and an interface). The `Should Be Equal` and `Should Be Within` assertions are extensively used for result verification.
