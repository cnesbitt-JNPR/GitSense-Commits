# Activity Summary for 2/27/2025

## 10:03:29 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` (last updated 2/27/2025, 9:37:16 AM) focuses on testing SNMP functionality within a 128T system.  It utilizes numerous custom libraries (InitRobot, AlarmHandlerLib, CliLib, CommonLib, LinuxDevices, LinuxLib, Timeseries, SNMPLib, SSHLib, T128) and resource files (TestbedStore, AlarmCommon, MibDefinitions, SnmpCommon, BaseSuiteVariables).

The suite includes tests for:

* **SNMPv2 Host MIB Sanity:** Verifies basic SNMPv2 object retrieval (sysObjectID, sysLocation).
* **T128 System MIB Basic Objects:** Checks scalar objects from the T128-SYSTEM-MIB (t128RouterName, t128NodeName, t128NodeRole, t128AssetId).
* **T128 System MIB Process Table:** Tests retrieval and verification of data from the t128ProcessTable.
* **SNMP Get Table IfTable:**  Thoroughly tests the IF-MIB::ifTable, verifying numerous interface attributes (ifIndex, ifDescr, ifType, ifMtu, ifSpeed, ifPhysAddress, ifAdminStatus, ifOperStatus, ifLastChange, ifInOctets, ifInUcastPkts, ifInNUcastPkts, ifInDiscards, ifInErrors, ifInUnknownProtos, ifOutOctets, ifOutUcastPkts, ifOutNUcastPkts, ifOutDiscards, ifOutErrors, ifOutQLen, ifSpecific).  It dynamically handles different interface speeds (1Gb/s or 10Gb/s).
* **T128 Alarm MIB Alarm Tables:**  Tests the retrieval of alarm data from the T128-ALARM-MIB, including active and shelved alarms, manipulating maintenance mode to trigger alarms.  It uses `Find Active Intf Alarm Index` and `Find Shelved Intf Alarm Index` keywords, suggesting helper functions to locate specific alarm entries.
* **T128 Metrics MIB Metrics Table:** Tests retrieval and verification of data from the T128-METRICS-MIB::t128MetricsTable.
* **Receive Alarm Trap:** Simulates interface bounces to verify that SNMP traps are received (both shelved and unshelved) using `Expect Received T128 Network Trap Admin Down` keyword, includes a sleep statement (60s) which is marked as temporary pending a more robust connection check.  This test also interacts with interface configuration and maintenance mode.

Many tests utilize the `${DUT1_SNMP}` variable, indicating a consistent approach to interacting with the Device Under Test via SNMP.  The tests extensively use `Should Be Equal` and `Should Be Within` assertions, showing a strong focus on precise result validation.  The use of tags like `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, and `ci_jenkins` suggests an automated CI/CD integration.  The presence of several helper keywords and custom libraries shows a well-structured and modular test design.

The log shows multiple revisions of a Robot Framework test suite (`SnmpSuite.robot`) focused on testing SNMP functionality within a 128T system.  The file remains largely unchanged across all revisions, indicating a stable test suite.  The timestamps indicate that modifications occurred between 10:13 AM and 10:41 AM on February 27, 2025.  The changes between revisions are minor and do not affect the core functionality of the test suite.


The test suite uses several custom libraries (`AlarmHandlerLib.py`, `CliLib.py`, `CommonLib.py`, `LinuxDevices.py`, `LinuxLib.py`, `Timeseries.py`, `SNMPLib.py`, `SSHLib.py`, `T128.py`, and `InitRobot.py`) and resources (`TestbedStore.robot`, `AlarmCommon.robot`, `MibDefinitions.robot`, `SnmpCommon.robot`, and `BaseSuiteVariables.robot`) suggesting a well-structured project.  The test cases consistently use variables such as `${DUT1_SNMP}`, `${DUT1_ROUTER}`, `${DUT1_NODE_NAME}`, and `${DUT1_ASSET_ID}`  for device-specific configuration.  The tests cover various aspects of SNMP, including:

* **SNMPv2 Host MIB Sanity Test:** Verifying basic SNMPv2 object retrieval.
* **T128 System MIB tests:** Checking various scalar and table objects from the T128-SYSTEM-MIB.
* **IF-MIB::ifTable Test:**  A comprehensive test of the IF-MIB interface table, including data validation against metrics retrieved from `/stats/interface`.
* **T128 Alarm MIB tests:** Testing alarm table functionalities, including shelving and unshelving alarms.
* **T128 Metrics MIB tests:** Verifying metrics from the T128-METRICS-MIB.
* **SNMP Trap Reception:**  Testing the reception of SNMP traps generated by interface events, both shelved and unshelved.


The `[Tags]` section in each test case consistently includes `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins`, suggesting a CI/CD integration and a focus on stability testing across different platforms (likely RHEL).  The  `# TODO` comment in the `Receive Alarm Trap` test case hints at ongoing development or improvement.
