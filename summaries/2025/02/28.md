# Activity Summary for 2/28/2025

## 10:05:25 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Robot Framework test suite (`SnmpSuite.robot`) and a Python library (`SNMPLib.py`) related to SNMP testing.  The `SnmpSuite.robot` file underwent several revisions between 9:13 AM and 10:01 AM on February 28th, 2025.  These revisions primarily involved minor adjustments to test case teardown sections and no significant changes to the core test logic were observed. The `SnmpSuite.robot` file consistently uses numerous libraries for various functionalities, including `InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, and `T128`.  The test suite focuses on verifying SNMP functionality, including checks against the SNMPv2 Host MIB, T128 System MIB (basic objects and tables), IF-MIB (ifTable), T128 Alarm MIB (Alarm tables and shelved status), and T128 Metrics MIB.

The `SNMPLib.py` file was updated at 9:21:55 AM on February 28th, 2025. This update added several functions for interacting with SNMP, including `create_snmp_session_to`, `create_snmp_session`, `get_snmp_object`, `expect_received_trap`, `expect_received_t128_network_trap_admin_down`, `expect_received_t128_network_trap_oper_down`, `get_next_snmp_object`, and `snmp_walk`.  These functions provide various levels of interaction for retrieving SNMP objects and verifying the reception of SNMP traps.  The library utilizes the `pysnmp` library for SNMP communication and includes constants for specific MIB objects and OIDs, mainly focusing on T128-ALARM-MIB and related objects.  The addition of functions to handle the retrieval of next SNMP object and walking of SNMP tables indicate an enhancement to the SNMP interaction capabilities.


## 11:05:21 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` file.  The file contains Robot Framework test suite for testing SNMP functionality, specifically focusing on 128T devices.  No substantial changes were made to the content across the different revisions.  All revisions share the same structure, including libraries, resources, test cases, and keywords. The timestamps indicate frequent updates within a short time frame (between 10:06 AM and 10:40 AM on February 28th, 2025).  The test cases consistently use keywords like `Get Snmp Object` and `Snmp Get Table` to interact with SNMP agents, validating responses against expected values derived from variables,  and external metric sources.  The test suite is extensively tagged with `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins`, suggesting an automated testing environment.  A recurring element is the testing of SNMP objects from various MIBs (SNMPv2-MIB, T128-SYSTEM-MIB, T128-ALARM-MIB, T128-METRICS-MIB, and IF-MIB),  and the interface 10 (`${TEST_IF}`).  The `Receive Alarm Trap` and `Receive ifDown and ifUp Traps` test cases highlight SNMP trap handling, involving interface bouncing and maintenance mode configuration.  Overall, the revisions show no significant code changes; the minor time differences likely reflect iterative saving or minor adjustments within the same testing framework.
