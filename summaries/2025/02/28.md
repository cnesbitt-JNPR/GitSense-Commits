# Activity Summary for 2/28/2025

## 10:05:25 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Robot Framework test suite (`SnmpSuite.robot`) and a Python library (`SNMPLib.py`) related to SNMP testing.  The `SnmpSuite.robot` file underwent several revisions between 9:13 AM and 10:01 AM on February 28th, 2025.  These revisions primarily involved minor adjustments to test case teardown sections and no significant changes to the core test logic were observed. The `SnmpSuite.robot` file consistently uses numerous libraries for various functionalities, including `InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, and `T128`.  The test suite focuses on verifying SNMP functionality, including checks against the SNMPv2 Host MIB, T128 System MIB (basic objects and tables), IF-MIB (ifTable), T128 Alarm MIB (Alarm tables and shelved status), and T128 Metrics MIB.

The `SNMPLib.py` file was updated at 9:21:55 AM on February 28th, 2025. This update added several functions for interacting with SNMP, including `create_snmp_session_to`, `create_snmp_session`, `get_snmp_object`, `expect_received_trap`, `expect_received_t128_network_trap_admin_down`, `expect_received_t128_network_trap_oper_down`, `get_next_snmp_object`, and `snmp_walk`.  These functions provide various levels of interaction for retrieving SNMP objects and verifying the reception of SNMP traps.  The library utilizes the `pysnmp` library for SNMP communication and includes constants for specific MIB objects and OIDs, mainly focusing on T128-ALARM-MIB and related objects.  The addition of functions to handle the retrieval of next SNMP object and walking of SNMP tables indicate an enhancement to the SNMP interaction capabilities.
