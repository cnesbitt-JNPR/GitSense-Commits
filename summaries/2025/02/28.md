# Activity Summary for 2/28/2025

## 10:05:25 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Robot Framework test suite (`SnmpSuite.robot`) and a Python library (`SNMPLib.py`) related to SNMP testing.  The `SnmpSuite.robot` file underwent several revisions between 9:13 AM and 10:01 AM on February 28th, 2025.  These revisions primarily involved minor adjustments to test case teardown sections and no significant changes to the core test logic were observed. The `SnmpSuite.robot` file consistently uses numerous libraries for various functionalities, including `InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, and `T128`.  The test suite focuses on verifying SNMP functionality, including checks against the SNMPv2 Host MIB, T128 System MIB (basic objects and tables), IF-MIB (ifTable), T128 Alarm MIB (Alarm tables and shelved status), and T128 Metrics MIB.

The `SNMPLib.py` file was updated at 9:21:55 AM on February 28th, 2025. This update added several functions for interacting with SNMP, including `create_snmp_session_to`, `create_snmp_session`, `get_snmp_object`, `expect_received_trap`, `expect_received_t128_network_trap_admin_down`, `expect_received_t128_network_trap_oper_down`, `get_next_snmp_object`, and `snmp_walk`.  These functions provide various levels of interaction for retrieving SNMP objects and verifying the reception of SNMP traps.  The library utilizes the `pysnmp` library for SNMP communication and includes constants for specific MIB objects and OIDs, mainly focusing on T128-ALARM-MIB and related objects.  The addition of functions to handle the retrieval of next SNMP object and walking of SNMP tables indicate an enhancement to the SNMP interaction capabilities.


## 11:05:21 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` file.  The file contains Robot Framework test suite for testing SNMP functionality, specifically focusing on 128T devices.  No substantial changes were made to the content across the different revisions.  All revisions share the same structure, including libraries, resources, test cases, and keywords. The timestamps indicate frequent updates within a short time frame (between 10:06 AM and 10:40 AM on February 28th, 2025).  The test cases consistently use keywords like `Get Snmp Object` and `Snmp Get Table` to interact with SNMP agents, validating responses against expected values derived from variables,  and external metric sources.  The test suite is extensively tagged with `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins`, suggesting an automated testing environment.  A recurring element is the testing of SNMP objects from various MIBs (SNMPv2-MIB, T128-SYSTEM-MIB, T128-ALARM-MIB, T128-METRICS-MIB, and IF-MIB),  and the interface 10 (`${TEST_IF}`).  The `Receive Alarm Trap` and `Receive ifDown and ifUp Traps` test cases highlight SNMP trap handling, involving interface bouncing and maintenance mode configuration.  Overall, the revisions show no significant code changes; the minor time differences likely reflect iterative saving or minor adjustments within the same testing framework.


## 2:05:23 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.hpp` files between 1:31 PM and 1:58 PM on February 28, 2025.  The code implements a password security scanner that checks the `/etc/shadow` file for users with default passwords from a predefined list.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` changes:**

* **Initial Commit (1:31 PM):** The initial version of the `PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` was committed.  This version included a `readShadowFile` function that contained a debugging log statement to print the contents of the shadow file. This log statement was commented out later.  The `checkEntryForViolations` function passed a `std::vector<std::string>& usersWithDefaultPW` by reference. The `doesUserHaveDefaultPassword` function had a minor error handling `hashFunction` as pointer.

* **1:32 PM:** A minor change was made; no functional changes were observed.

* **1:44 PM:** The `doesUserHaveDefaultPassword` function was corrected; the `hashFunction` was checked using `!hashFunction` instead of `hashFunction == nullptr`.

* **1:45 PM:** The debugging log statement in the `readShadowFile` function was removed. This means the shadow file content will no longer be printed.


* **1:47 PM - 1:58 PM:** Several commits focused on refactoring the code.  The `checkEntryForViolations` and `updateDefaultPasswordViolationState` functions were modified to remove the `std::vector<std::string>& usersWithDefaultPW` parameter, making the  `usersWithDefaultPW` a member variable of the class and clearing it at the beginning of `scanShadowFileForViolations`. This improved the design by reducing the number of parameters.  The `buildDefaultPasswordViolations` function was similarly changed to not require the `usersWithDefaultPW` vector as a parameter. The error handling in `doesUserHaveDefaultPassword` was also improved by changing log levels from `DebugLog` to `ErrorLog`  for certain errors to improve the reporting of serious issues.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.hpp` changes:**

* **1:47 PM:** The header file was updated to reflect the changes made in the `.cpp` file, primarily removing the `usersWithDefaultPW` parameter from the function signatures. The `usersWithDefaultPW` is made a member variable.  This shows a consistent effort to maintain consistency between the header and implementation files.

* **1:48 PM:**  Further modifications to the header file removed the `usersWithDefaultPW` parameter from the `updateDefaultPasswordViolationState` and `buildDefaultPasswordViolations` functions reflecting the changes in the corresponding .cpp file.

The overall pattern in the code changes indicates a focus on improving code clarity, error handling, and design by refactoring the functions to improve code maintainability.  The changes were made in a relatively short period, suggesting a focused development effort.


## 3:05:21 PM
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.hpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` files on February 28, 2025.

The `PasswordSecurityScanner.hpp` file was updated at 2:07:45 PM,  defining the class `PasswordSecurityScanner`. This class includes methods for scanning a shadow file for users with default passwords,  handling timeouts, updating violation states, and building and writing violation reports using the `dolly::dynamic` library.  The header file declares static members defining default settings like shadow file path, scan timer interval, target usernames, and default passwords.


The `PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp` file underwent two updates. The first, at 2:14:16 PM, contained the implementation of the methods declared in the header file. It uses regular expressions to parse the shadow file entries,  `crypto::HashUtil` for password hash verification, and logging functionalities.  The `writeDefaultPasswordViolations` function is stubbed, indicating ongoing development.  The second update at 2:14:30 PM appears to be a minor change, with only a slight difference in the `scanShadowFileForViolations` method's comment regarding clearing the `usersWithDefaultPW` vector.  The difference is in a colon being added. This change is inconsequential and likely a code style correction.

Both `.cpp` updates include the same copyright notice for Juniper Networks.  The code consistently uses the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON-like data structures and handles potential exceptions during file reading. The core functionality revolves around detecting users with weak passwords by comparing hashed passwords against a list of known default passwords, utilizing different hash algorithms (SHA256 and SHA512).  The system appears to be designed to monitor and report password security vulnerabilities within a system, likely for security auditing or alerting.
