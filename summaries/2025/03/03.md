# Activity Summary for 3/3/2025

## 10:03:33 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `SnmpSuite.robot` (last updated 3/3/2025, 9:14:28 AM) tests SNMP functionality on a 128T device.  It uses numerous libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, `T128`) and resources (`TestbedStore`, `AlarmCommon`, `MibDefinitions`, `SnmpCommon`, `BaseSuiteVariables`).

The suite includes tests for:

* **SNMPv2 Host MIB Sanity:** Verifies basic SNMPv2 MIB object retrieval.
* **T128 System MIB Basic Objects:** Checks various T128-SYSTEM-MIB scalar objects.
* **T128 System MIB Process Table:** Tests retrieval and verification of entries in the T128-SYSTEM-MIB Process table.
* **Snmp Get Table IfTable:**  Retrieves and validates data from the IF-MIB::ifTable, including interface statistics (octets, packets).  It handles varying interface speeds gracefully.
* **T128 Alarm MIB Alarm Tables:**  Tests alarm table interactions, including maintenance mode configuration and alarm shelving.  It verifies the impact on SNMP object retrieval (`Get Next`).
* **T128 Metrics MIB Metrics Table:**  Tests retrieval and verification of entries in the T128-METRICS-MIB Metrics table.
* **Receive Alarm Trap:**  Tests the reception of SNMP traps (Admin Down) triggered by interface bouncing, both shelved and unshelved. This test includes a 60-second sleep (marked as TODO for removal).
* **Receive ifDown and ifUp Traps:** Tests reception of ifDown and ifUp traps using `ifdown` and `ifup` commands.

The `Snmp Suite Setup` keyword initializes the test environment, including SNMP configuration, SSH and CLI sessions, and a trap receiver.  The tests heavily rely on variables like `${DUT1_SNMP}`, `${DUT1_ROUTER}`, `${TEST_IF}`, etc., defined within the suite or in imported resources.  Many tests utilize the `Get Snmp Object` and `Snmp Get Table` keywords from the `SNMPLib` library.  The tests are tagged with `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins`, suggesting a continuous integration testing workflow.

The Robot Framework test suite `SnmpSuite.robot` (last updated 3/3/2025, 10:10:47 AM) focuses on testing SNMP functionality within a 128T system.  It uses numerous libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, `T128`) and resources (`TestbedStore`, `AlarmCommon`, `MibDefinitions`, `SnmpCommon`, `BaseSuiteVariables`).

The suite includes tests for SNMPv2 Host MIB sanity checks, verification of T128 system MIB objects (including the process and metrics tables), and interaction with the IF-MIB (interface table).  It also tests alarm handling, including shelving, and the reception of SNMP traps (both `ifDown` and `ifUp`, and T128 network traps related to interface administration).  The tests extensively use the `Get Snmp Object` and `Snmp Get Table` keywords to retrieve and verify SNMP data.

Significant reliance is placed on variables like `${DUT1_SNMP}`, `${DUT1_ROUTER}`, `${DUT1_NODE_NAME}`, `${DUT1_ASSET_ID}`, `${TEST_IF}`,  and `${TD_CONNECTION}` which are likely defined elsewhere (e.g., in the resource files).  The tests employ a common pattern of retrieving SNMP data, and then asserting expected values against the received data.  There is also use of helper keywords to manage interface configurations, maintenance modes, and waiting for expected conditions.  The test suite incorporates waits for keywords to succeed (e.g., `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds`), implying some degree of asynchronous operation.   A noticeable pattern is the extensive use of tags like `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, and `snmp`, suggesting a CI/CD integration.  The `Snmp Suite Setup` and `Snmp Suite Teardown` keywords manage test suite setup and cleanup including configuring SNMP access and sessions.

The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/SNMPLib.py` file and the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` file.  No changes were observed in the code content of `SNMPLib.py` across the revisions. The `SnmpSuite.robot` file also remained unchanged across its multiple revisions.  The timestamps indicate that the changes were made within a short time span on March 3rd, 2025, between 11:27 AM and 12:03 PM.  The `SNMPLib.py` file contains functions for creating SNMP sessions, retrieving SNMP objects (single and next), walking SNMP objects, and expecting received SNMP traps (with specific functions for T128 network traps).  The `SnmpSuite.robot` file appears to be a Robot Framework test suite utilizing the `SNMPLib.py` library for testing SNMP functionality, including sanity checks on SNMPv2 MIB, T128 system MIB, and IF-MIB,  as well as tests for receiving SNMP traps. The tests extensively use the `Get Snmp Object`, `Snmp Get Table`, and `Expect Received Trap` keywords, indicating a comprehensive approach to validating SNMP features.
