# Activity Summary for 3/3/2025

## 10:03:33 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `SnmpSuite.robot` (last updated 3/3/2025, 9:14:28 AM) tests SNMP functionality on a 128T device.  It uses numerous libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, `T128`) and resources (`TestbedStore`, `AlarmCommon`, `MibDefinitions`, `SnmpCommon`, `BaseSuiteVariables`).

The suite includes tests for:

* **SNMPv2 Host MIB Sanity:** Verifies basic SNMPv2 MIB object retrieval.
* **T128 System MIB Basic Objects:** Checks various T128-SYSTEM-MIB scalar objects.
* **T128 System MIB Process Table:** Tests retrieval and verification of entries in the T128-SYSTEM-MIB Process table.
* **Snmp Get Table IfTable:**  Retrieves and validates data from the IF-MIB::ifTable, including interface statistics (octets, packets).  It handles varying interface speeds gracefully.
* **T128 Alarm MIB Alarm Tables:**  Tests alarm table interactions, including maintenance mode configuration and alarm shelving.  It verifies the impact on SNMP object retrieval (`Get Next`).
* **T128 Metrics MIB Metrics Table:**  Tests retrieval and verification of entries in the T128-METRICS-MIB Metrics table.
* **Receive Alarm Trap:**  Tests the reception of SNMP traps (Admin Down) triggered by interface bouncing, both shelved and unshelved. This test includes a 60-second sleep (marked as TODO for removal).
* **Receive ifDown and ifUp Traps:** Tests reception of ifDown and ifUp traps using `ifdown` and `ifup` commands.

The `Snmp Suite Setup` keyword initializes the test environment, including SNMP configuration, SSH and CLI sessions, and a trap receiver.  The tests heavily rely on variables like `${DUT1_SNMP}`, `${DUT1_ROUTER}`, `${TEST_IF}`, etc., defined within the suite or in imported resources.  Many tests utilize the `Get Snmp Object` and `Snmp Get Table` keywords from the `SNMPLib` library.  The tests are tagged with `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `snmp`, and `ci_jenkins`, suggesting a continuous integration testing workflow.
