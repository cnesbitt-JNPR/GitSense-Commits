# Activity Summary for 3/4/2025

## 10:03:33 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `SnmpSuite.robot` (last updated 3/4/2025, 9:18:52 AM)  tests SNMP functionality within a 128T system.  It uses numerous libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, `T128`) and resources (`TestbedStore`, `AlarmCommon`, `MibDefinitions`, `SnmpCommon`, `BaseSuiteVariables`).

The suite includes test cases focused on verifying SNMP object retrieval from various MIBs (SNMPv2-MIB, T128-SYSTEM-MIB, T128-ALARM-MIB, T128-METRICS-MIB, IF-MIB).  `SNMPv2 Host MIB Sanity Test` checks basic SNMPv2 objects. `T128 System Mib Basic Objects` and `T128 System Mib Process Table`  test T128-SYSTEM-MIB scalar and table objects respectively.  `Snmp Get Table IfTable` extensively tests the IF-MIB::ifTable, including interface speed and traffic counters. `T128 Alarm Mib Alarm Tables` tests alarm management functionalities, including maintenance mode interaction. `T128 Metrics Mib Metrics Table` verifies data retrieval from the T128-METRICS-MIB.  Finally, `Receive Alarm Trap` and `Receive ifDown and ifUp Traps` test the reception of SNMP traps, notably for interface events.

The tests heavily rely on variables like `${DUT1_SNMP}`, `${DUT1_ROUTER}`, `${DUT1_NODE_NAME}`, and `${TEST_IF}` representing DUT information and interface configurations.  The `Snmp Suite Setup` keyword performs setup tasks including creating SSH and SNMP sessions and configuring the test environment.  Recurring patterns involve using `Get Snmp Object` and `Snmp Get Table` keywords for data retrieval and `Should Be Equal` for assertion. The tests utilize a variety of tags, prominently  `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, and `snmp`, suggesting a CI/CD integration. Several keywords like `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` and `Wait Until Alarms Are Triggered` indicate mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations and timing dependencies.

The log shows a single code change on March 4, 2025, at 10:23:07 AM, affecting the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py`.  This Python file defines a library for handling alarms.  Key features include:

* **`Alarm` class:** This class represents an individual alarm, storing attributes like ID, node, router, process, source, time, message, category, severity, shelved status, shelved reason, and value. It provides methods for comparison (`__eq__`, `__hash__`), dictionary-like access (`__contains__`, `__getitem__`), and string representation (`__str__`).

* **Alarm Retrieval Functions:** The file contains multiple functions to retrieve alarms based on different criteria:
    * `get_all_alarms()`: Retrieves all alarms (current and shelved).
    * `get_alarms_for_given_time_range()`: Retrieves alarms within a specified time range using a `DateTimeRange` object.  This function utilizes a REST API call via `RestLib.make_rest_request_on`.
    * `get_current_alarms()`: Retrieves only current (unshelved) alarms.
    * `get_shelved_alarms()`: Retrieves only shelved alarms.
    * `get_default_password_alarms()`: Retrieves alarms related to default passwords.  This is specifically designed for ignoring alarms triggered by default DUT configurations during testing.  Variations exist to retrieve all, current, or shelved default password alarms.

* **`_get_alarms()` and `_get_default_password_alarms()`:**  These are likely helper functions (private due to leading underscore) used by the various alarm retrieval functions.

* **`verify_all_alarms()`:** This function compares a set of retrieved alarms against a set of expected alarms, allowing for the specification of alarms to ignore.  This is crucial for robust alarm verification in testing.


The code uses logging (`logging.getLogger(__name__)`) and an `enum` class (`ShelvedStatus`) for better organization and readability.  The functions extensively use docstrings to explain their purpose, arguments, return values, and usage examples.  The overarching pattern is the consistent handling and filtering of alarms based on different statuses (all, current, shelved) and the potential for filtering based on specific alarm messages (as seen in the `get_default_password_alarms` functions).
