# Activity Summary for 3/4/2025

## 10:03:33 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `SnmpSuite.robot` (last updated 3/4/2025, 9:18:52 AM)  tests SNMP functionality within a 128T system.  It uses numerous libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, `T128`) and resources (`TestbedStore`, `AlarmCommon`, `MibDefinitions`, `SnmpCommon`, `BaseSuiteVariables`).

The suite includes test cases focused on verifying SNMP object retrieval from various MIBs (SNMPv2-MIB, T128-SYSTEM-MIB, T128-ALARM-MIB, T128-METRICS-MIB, IF-MIB).  `SNMPv2 Host MIB Sanity Test` checks basic SNMPv2 objects. `T128 System Mib Basic Objects` and `T128 System Mib Process Table`  test T128-SYSTEM-MIB scalar and table objects respectively.  `Snmp Get Table IfTable` extensively tests the IF-MIB::ifTable, including interface speed and traffic counters. `T128 Alarm Mib Alarm Tables` tests alarm management functionalities, including maintenance mode interaction. `T128 Metrics Mib Metrics Table` verifies data retrieval from the T128-METRICS-MIB.  Finally, `Receive Alarm Trap` and `Receive ifDown and ifUp Traps` test the reception of SNMP traps, notably for interface events.

The tests heavily rely on variables like `${DUT1_SNMP}`, `${DUT1_ROUTER}`, `${DUT1_NODE_NAME}`, and `${TEST_IF}` representing DUT information and interface configurations.  The `Snmp Suite Setup` keyword performs setup tasks including creating SSH and SNMP sessions and configuring the test environment.  Recurring patterns involve using `Get Snmp Object` and `Snmp Get Table` keywords for data retrieval and `Should Be Equal` for assertion. The tests utilize a variety of tags, prominently  `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, and `snmp`, suggesting a CI/CD integration. Several keywords like `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` and `Wait Until Alarms Are Triggered` indicate mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations and timing dependencies.
