# Activity Summary for 3/4/2025

## 10:03:33 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `SnmpSuite.robot` (last updated 3/4/2025, 9:18:52 AM)  tests SNMP functionality within a 128T system.  It uses numerous libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, `T128`) and resources (`TestbedStore`, `AlarmCommon`, `MibDefinitions`, `SnmpCommon`, `BaseSuiteVariables`).

The suite includes test cases focused on verifying SNMP object retrieval from various MIBs (SNMPv2-MIB, T128-SYSTEM-MIB, T128-ALARM-MIB, T128-METRICS-MIB, IF-MIB).  `SNMPv2 Host MIB Sanity Test` checks basic SNMPv2 objects. `T128 System Mib Basic Objects` and `T128 System Mib Process Table`  test T128-SYSTEM-MIB scalar and table objects respectively.  `Snmp Get Table IfTable` extensively tests the IF-MIB::ifTable, including interface speed and traffic counters. `T128 Alarm Mib Alarm Tables` tests alarm management functionalities, including maintenance mode interaction. `T128 Metrics Mib Metrics Table` verifies data retrieval from the T128-METRICS-MIB.  Finally, `Receive Alarm Trap` and `Receive ifDown and ifUp Traps` test the reception of SNMP traps, notably for interface events.

The tests heavily rely on variables like `${DUT1_SNMP}`, `${DUT1_ROUTER}`, `${DUT1_NODE_NAME}`, and `${TEST_IF}` representing DUT information and interface configurations.  The `Snmp Suite Setup` keyword performs setup tasks including creating SSH and SNMP sessions and configuring the test environment.  Recurring patterns involve using `Get Snmp Object` and `Snmp Get Table` keywords for data retrieval and `Should Be Equal` for assertion. The tests utilize a variety of tags, prominently  `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, and `snmp`, suggesting a CI/CD integration. Several keywords like `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` and `Wait Until Alarms Are Triggered` indicate mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations and timing dependencies.

The log shows a single code change on March 4, 2025, at 10:23:07 AM, affecting the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py`.  This Python file defines a library for handling alarms.  Key features include:

* **`Alarm` class:** This class represents an individual alarm, storing attributes like ID, node, router, process, source, time, message, category, severity, shelved status, shelved reason, and value. It provides methods for comparison (`__eq__`, `__hash__`), dictionary-like access (`__contains__`, `__getitem__`), and string representation (`__str__`).

* **Alarm Retrieval Functions:** The file contains multiple functions to retrieve alarms based on different criteria:
    * `get_all_alarms()`: Retrieves all alarms (current and shelved).
    * `get_alarms_for_given_time_range()`: Retrieves alarms within a specified time range using a `DateTimeRange` object.  This function utilizes a REST API call via `RestLib.make_rest_request_on`.
    * `get_current_alarms()`: Retrieves only current (unshelved) alarms.
    * `get_shelved_alarms()`: Retrieves only shelved alarms.
    * `get_default_password_alarms()`: Retrieves alarms related to default passwords.  This is specifically designed for ignoring alarms triggered by default DUT configurations during testing.  Variations exist to retrieve all, current, or shelved default password alarms.

* **`_get_alarms()` and `_get_default_password_alarms()`:**  These are likely helper functions (private due to leading underscore) used by the various alarm retrieval functions.

* **`verify_all_alarms()`:** This function compares a set of retrieved alarms against a set of expected alarms, allowing for the specification of alarms to ignore.  This is crucial for robust alarm verification in testing.


The code uses logging (`logging.getLogger(__name__)`) and an `enum` class (`ShelvedStatus`) for better organization and readability.  The functions extensively use docstrings to explain their purpose, arguments, return values, and usage examples.  The overarching pattern is the consistent handling and filtering of alarms based on different statuses (all, current, shelved) and the potential for filtering based on specific alarm messages (as seen in the `get_default_password_alarms` functions).


## 12:03:37 PM
The log shows Robot Framework test suite modifications across several files between 11:21 AM and 11:58 AM on March 4, 2025.  The main focus is on testing alarm handling and BGP functionality.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` (11:21:18 AM): This file contains test cases focused on verifying alarm counts on an HA router under various network conditions (e.g., dropping conductor traffic, manipulating KNI interfaces).  It uses several libraries for network interaction (SSHLib, LinuxLib, NodeConnectivity), alarm handling (AlarmHandlerLib), and testbed management (TestbedStore).  The tests heavily utilize keywords like `Wait For Stable Connectivity Between All Duts`, `Verify All Devices Have No Alarms`, and functions to manipulate network interfaces.  The `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` tags suggest these tests are part of a nightly build verification process.  A significant portion of the test suite involves manipulating the `KNI_INTF_NAME` interface on `DUT3_ROUTER` and verifying resulting alarms.  Another test case focuses on clearing default password alarms after password updates.  The test uses timeouts (`Wait Until Keyword Succeeds 3m 30s`) to ensure network stability.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/BGP/Bgp.robot` (11:22:43 AM, 11:23:51 AM, 11:24:39 AM): This file shows multiple revisions of BGP functionality tests.  The tests use libraries for BGP management (BgpLib), Spirent traffic generation (Spirent), alarm handling (AlarmHandlerLib), and other network functions.  Test cases focus on verifying BGP route advertisement, traffic routing, and the impact of manipulating provisional device status on BGP routes and alarms.  The `traffic`, `spirent`, `bgp`, `nightly_stable`, and `nightly_stable_rhel` tags indicate the tests involve network traffic, use Spirent equipment, and are also part of a nightly build process.  Multiple revisions show incremental additions or minor changes to test cases without major structural alterations.  The tests extensively use `Set Provisional Status` keyword to test various scenarios around BGP route and session stability.  Additional tests verify BGP graceful restart configurations and BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) integration with BGP.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` (11:42:34 AM): This file contains SNMP tests verifying various MIB (Management Information Base) objects and alarm traps. The tests utilize libraries for SNMP interactions (SNMPLib), CLI commands (CliLib), and alarm handling (AlarmHandlerLib). Test cases cover verifying basic MIB objects, checking the process table, ifTable entries, alarm table entries (including shelved alarms), and receiving SNMP traps for interface events. The `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` tags again highlight its inclusion in nightly testing.  It employs keywords like `Wait Until Alarms Are Triggered`, `Verify Interface Alarm Is In Alarm Table`, and `Expect Received T128 Network Trap`. The extensive use of `Should Be Equal` and `Should Be Within` assertions indicates a strong focus on exact data validation.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py` (11:58:08 AM): This library file defines functions for retrieving and handling alarms from devices. It uses the `RestLib` library for REST API interactions and provides functions to get all alarms, current alarms, shelved alarms, and alarms related to default passwords. The code defines an `Alarm` class to encapsulate alarm details, supporting comparisons and hashing for efficient alarm management.  The functions support legacy and top-level alarm endpoints and handle different shelved statuses.  The introduction of the `_get_alarms` and `_get_default_password_alarms` helper functions reveals a consistent pattern of retrieving alarms based on various criteria.


In summary, the code changes represent a comprehensive set of automated tests for verifying the stability and functionality of a network system, focusing on alarm management and BGP behavior. The consistent use of tags like `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` indicates a regular testing and integration process.  The extensive usage of libraries for network manipulation and assertion keywords demonstrates a robust testing framework.
