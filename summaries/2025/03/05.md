# Activity Summary for 3/5/2025

## 10:07:14 AM
The log shows code changes on March 5th, 2025.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py` file was updated at 9:16:47 AM. This file contains a Python library for handling alarms, including functions to retrieve alarms (all, current, shelved, default password alarms),  and verify alarm counts.  The `Alarm` class defines the structure for representing an alarm, including its ID, node, router, process, source, time, message, category, severity, shelved status, shelved reason, and value. Multiple functions are implemented to fetch alarms based on different criteria (e.g., time range, shelved status) and utilize a REST API (`RestLib`).

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` file was updated at 9:30:36 AM. This Robot Framework test suite uses the `AlarmHandlerLib.py` library to test alarm functionality on a High Availability (HA) router.  The test suite includes multiple test cases focused on verifying alarm counts under various scenarios (e.g., network connectivity issues, default password usage). It involves manipulating network interfaces (`kniTest`), dropping and restoring network traffic, updating passwords, and verifying the presence or absence of specific alarms. The tests use keywords from other libraries (e.g., `LinuxLib`, `NodeConnectivity`, `SSHLib`) for interacting with the system.  The tests extensively use `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` indicating a need for reliable and timely responses from the system under test.  The recurring theme is verifying the correctness of alarm reporting under diverse network conditions and password management scenarios.
