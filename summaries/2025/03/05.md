# Activity Summary for 3/5/2025

## 10:07:14 AM
The log shows code changes on March 5th, 2025.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py` file was updated at 9:16:47 AM. This file contains a Python library for handling alarms, including functions to retrieve alarms (all, current, shelved, default password alarms),  and verify alarm counts.  The `Alarm` class defines the structure for representing an alarm, including its ID, node, router, process, source, time, message, category, severity, shelved status, shelved reason, and value. Multiple functions are implemented to fetch alarms based on different criteria (e.g., time range, shelved status) and utilize a REST API (`RestLib`).

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` file was updated at 9:30:36 AM. This Robot Framework test suite uses the `AlarmHandlerLib.py` library to test alarm functionality on a High Availability (HA) router.  The test suite includes multiple test cases focused on verifying alarm counts under various scenarios (e.g., network connectivity issues, default password usage). It involves manipulating network interfaces (`kniTest`), dropping and restoring network traffic, updating passwords, and verifying the presence or absence of specific alarms. The tests use keywords from other libraries (e.g., `LinuxLib`, `NodeConnectivity`, `SSHLib`) for interacting with the system.  The tests extensively use `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` indicating a need for reliable and timely responses from the system under test.  The recurring theme is verifying the correctness of alarm reporting under diverse network conditions and password management scenarios.


## 12:07:19 PM
The log shows Robot Framework test suite modifications across several files between 11:14 AM and 12:06 PM on March 5th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on testing various functionalities, including application director, VRRP, PIM MSDP, and alarm shelving, along with performance tests involving Spirent traffic generation.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/RappidDirector/RappidApplications.robot` (11:14:59 AM): This file contains Robot Framework test cases for the RappidDirector application.  Updates include adding and modifying test cases (`Verify Use In Memory Database Flag`, `Verify Module Updates`, `Verify Aliased Applications`, `Verify Applications After Removing One Invalid App`, `Verify Applications After Removing Some Invalid App`, `Verify Applications After Removing All Invalid App`, `Verify Dynamic Managed Applications`) to validate application module registration, in-memory database flags, and alias usage.  The tests extensively utilize keywords like `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds`, `Verify Registered Application Modules`, and `Verify AD Module State`.  A recurring pattern is the verification of alarms after configuration changes.  The tests use tags `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel`, suggesting these are part of a nightly build verification process.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Vrrp/VrrpAlarm.robot` (11:17:21 AM): This file focuses on testing VRRP failover and alarm functionality. Test cases (`Basic Vrrp Alarm And Audit Event Test`, `Vrrp Low Priority Down No Alarm`, `Config Change Alarm Clear Test`) verify alarm behavior when VRRP interfaces go up or down. The tests make use of keywords like `Verify Device Has Vrrp Alarm`, `Verify Device Has No Alarms`, and `Wait For All Events`.  The `Config Change Alarm Clear Test` uses a template for different test scenarios (priority and enabled/disabled).

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/PIM/PimMsdpAlarms.robot` (11:34:59 AM, 11:36:00 AM, 11:41:38 AM): This file underwent multiple revisions within a short period.  It contains test cases (`Verify Peers drop from Established State Alarms`, `Verify Peers unable to reach Established State Alarms`, `Verify Bgp and Msdp Alarms`) to verify MSDP peer functionality and alarm generation for different scenarios (peers dropping, failing to establish, and BGP/MSDP alarm interaction). The tests leverage keywords like `Verify MSDP Alarm On`, `Verify No Alarms On`, and `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds`.  The multiple revisions likely involved incremental bug fixes or improvements to the test cases.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmShelving.robot` (11:42:48 AM, 11:43:26 AM, 11:44:21 AM, 11:45:49 AM):  This file also had multiple revisions, focused on testing alarm shelving mechanisms.  Multiple test cases (`Verify Router Name Shelf`, `Verify Router Name Regex Shelf`, `Verify Node Name Shelf`, `Verify Node Name Regex Shelf`, `Verify Category Shelf`, `Verify Severity Shelf`, `Verify Message Regex Shelf`, `Verify ANY Match Type Shelf`, `Verify ALL Match Type Shelf`) are included, each verifying alarm shelving with different criteria (router name, node name, category, severity, message, and match type).  The multiple revisions point to iterative refinement and potential bug fixes. A commented-out section suggests a planned test for resource-based shelving.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/performance/SpirentScaling/SpirentScaling.robot` (12:06:55 PM): This file describes performance tests using Spirent for scaling.  Test cases include (`Session Cyberflood Establish Max eBGP Route and Capture Performance`, `Session Cyberflood Establish Max iBGP Route and Capture Performance`, `UDP Run IMIX Performance With Max Peering Paths`, `UDP Run IMIX Performance With Max Session Using Spirent`, `Session Cyberflood Configure Max Ospf Routes And Verify Performance`) which check throughput and performance under different configurations and traffic types (eBGP, iBGP, UDP IMIX, OSPF).  The tests extensively use Spirent-related keywords and capture performance metrics.  The file incorporates many variables related to scaling thresholds, session counts, and network configurations.  The use of tags like `perf_colo`, `perf_westford`, and various scaling-related tags suggests these are performance tests run across different environments and hardware.


## 2:07:15 PM
The log shows code changes in two files within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm` directory on March 5th, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` was modified at 1:43:11 PM.  This file contains the implementation of `SystemChangeHandler`, a class responsible for handling system state changes and generating alarms.  The code extensively uses the `dolly` library for JSON parsing and manipulation.  Significant additions include functions to handle various system changes (memory usage, disk space, CPU utilization, NTP servers,  connections status, configuration application state, entitlement status, software version, AppID cache utilization, and default password violations).  Each change handler parses JSON data, performs calculations or comparisons against thresholds, and creates or clears alarms using an `AlarmFactory`.  The code includes error handling and uses different alarm severities (CRITICAL, MAJOR, INFO).  There is recurring use of `state::StatePathInfo` to represent system state information and  `dolly::parseJson` for JSON processing.  The `handleCpuUsageChange` function notably excludes isolated or dedicated CPU cores from the aggregate utilization calculation.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` was modified at 1:51:56 PM. This file contains unit tests for `SystemChangeHandler`.  The tests cover various scenarios, including:

* **Version Mismatch Alarms:** Testing alarm generation and clearing for software version mismatches across multiple nodes.  It includes tests for clearing alarms via node deletion.
* **CPU Usage Alarms:** Testing alarm generation and clearing based on CPU utilization, considering debounce counts and isolated/dedicated cores. Tests are performed for one and two nodes.
* **Configuration Node Utilization Alarms:** Testing alarm generation for high backend ZooKeeper jute buffer utilization.
* **App ID Cache Utilization Alarms:** Testing event-based alarms triggered when utilization exceeds a threshold.
* **Default Password Alarms:** Testing alarm generation for accounts with default passwords.

The tests use helper functions to create expected alarm objects for comparison, ensuring accurate testing of alarm creation and clearing behavior.  The tests demonstrate a comprehensive approach to verifying the functionality of `SystemChangeHandler` under various conditions.
