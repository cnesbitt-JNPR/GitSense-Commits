# Activity Summary for 3/6/2025

## 10:32:31 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of Robot Framework test suites focused on performance and scaling tests, primarily using Spirent traffic generators.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/solutions/BasicSvr/` files track Basic Server tests, while `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/performance/SpirentScaling/` files contain Spirent scaling tests.

The earliest changes (around 9:38 AM - 9:41 AM) to the `BasicSvrIxiaC.robot` file involve additions of documentation comments and seemingly minor adjustments within keywords.  A notable change in one of the revisions at  9:39:48 AM is the addition of `@{ignored_list}= Append Default Password Alarms ${ignored_list} ${ALL_DEVICES}` within the `Exclude Alarm Teardown` keyword, suggesting improvements to alarm handling and possibly an attempt to ignore specific default password related alarms. The `BasicSvr.robot` file undergoes changes between 9:40:49 AM and 9:41:41 AM, primarily focused on adding new test cases (`100 Services Configuration Test` and `100 Child Services Configuration Test`), illustrating an expansion of test coverage related to service configuration.  The addition of  `Validate All SSR System Connectivity Properties` keyword also points to a more robust validation process.


The `SpirentScaling.robot` file shows a series of revisions between 9:59 AM and 10:08 AM.  These edits seem focused on refinements and additions within existing test cases, with no major structural changes.  The timestamps suggest iterative development, with small additions and perhaps bug fixes implemented in quick succession. The recurring theme across all files is the extensive use of libraries for network device interaction (`CliLib`, `RestSolutions`, `Spirent`, etc.), BGP and OSPF configuration, and performance data collection and analysis.  The consistent inclusion of alarm handling and logging mechanisms indicate a strong emphasis on robust error detection and reporting within the test framework.  The test cases consistently use tags for better organization and filtering, often categorized by location (`perf_colo`, `perf_westford`), traffic type (`traffic`, `throughput`, `scaling`), and specific device types.
