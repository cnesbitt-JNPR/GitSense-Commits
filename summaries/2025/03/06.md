# Activity Summary for 3/6/2025

## 10:32:31 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of Robot Framework test suites focused on performance and scaling tests, primarily using Spirent traffic generators.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/solutions/BasicSvr/` files track Basic Server tests, while `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/performance/SpirentScaling/` files contain Spirent scaling tests.

The earliest changes (around 9:38 AM - 9:41 AM) to the `BasicSvrIxiaC.robot` file involve additions of documentation comments and seemingly minor adjustments within keywords.  A notable change in one of the revisions at  9:39:48 AM is the addition of `@{ignored_list}= Append Default Password Alarms ${ignored_list} ${ALL_DEVICES}` within the `Exclude Alarm Teardown` keyword, suggesting improvements to alarm handling and possibly an attempt to ignore specific default password related alarms. The `BasicSvr.robot` file undergoes changes between 9:40:49 AM and 9:41:41 AM, primarily focused on adding new test cases (`100 Services Configuration Test` and `100 Child Services Configuration Test`), illustrating an expansion of test coverage related to service configuration.  The addition of  `Validate All SSR System Connectivity Properties` keyword also points to a more robust validation process.


The `SpirentScaling.robot` file shows a series of revisions between 9:59 AM and 10:08 AM.  These edits seem focused on refinements and additions within existing test cases, with no major structural changes.  The timestamps suggest iterative development, with small additions and perhaps bug fixes implemented in quick succession. The recurring theme across all files is the extensive use of libraries for network device interaction (`CliLib`, `RestSolutions`, `Spirent`, etc.), BGP and OSPF configuration, and performance data collection and analysis.  The consistent inclusion of alarm handling and logging mechanisms indicate a strong emphasis on robust error detection and reporting within the test framework.  The test cases consistently use tags for better organization and filtering, often categorized by location (`perf_colo`, `perf_westford`), traffic type (`traffic`, `throughput`, `scaling`), and specific device types.


## 2:51:31 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/NodeMonitorTest.cpp` on March 6th, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be unit testing the `NodeMonitor` application.  The code uses the Google Test framework (`gtest/gtest.h`) and involves testing various aspects of the application, including CPU, memory, and disk utilization, as well as interactions with an audit daemon (`auditd`).

The first two revisions (1:54:14 PM and 1:54:37 PM) are nearly identical.  The only visible difference is a minor change in the `testCpuUtilization` function:  two lines of debug code (`auto configDynamic...` and `nm_test_utils::removeAllNonForwardingInterfaces(configDynamic);`) are commented out in the second revision.


The third revision (1:55:22 PM) is again nearly identical to the previous ones, with the debug code from `testCpuUtilization` uncommented.


The final revision (2:02:32 PM) includes a significant addition: a new line of code `::test::ConfigUtil::loadConfig(testHarnessNodeMonitor->getConfigObjects(), configDynamic);` is added at the end of the `testCpuUtilization` function. This suggests an attempt to add or modify configuration loading within that specific test case.  The other test functions remain unchanged across all revisions.


Throughout the log, there's consistent use of the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON manipulation,  the `boost::filesystem` library for file system operations, and a custom `test::` namespace for testing utilities.  The tests extensively verify that expected values match the internal state and external outputs of the `NodeMonitor`.  The `auditdInterfaceManager` tests show a systematic approach to verifying the handling of different audit event configurations (admin and system enabled/disabled).  The tests for `scrapeVersionInfo` appear focused on correctly parsing and handling different file formats in the version information directory.
