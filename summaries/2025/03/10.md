# Activity Summary for 3/10/2025

## 9:11:40 AM
The code changes log shows development on alarm handling within a system, likely for testing purposes.

On March 10th, 2025,  `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py` was updated at 8:23:59 AM. This file contains a Python library for handling alarms.  Key features include an `Alarm` class to represent individual alarms (with attributes like ID, node, time, message, severity, and shelved status), and functions to retrieve alarms (`get_all_alarms`, `get_current_alarms`, `get_shelved_alarms`), filter alarms by time range (`get_alarms_for_given_time_range`), and specifically handle default password alarms (`get_default_password_alarms`, etc.).  The library interacts with a REST API (`RestLib`) to fetch alarm data.

Two nearly identical updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot` occurred at 8:54:50 AM and 8:55:15 AM.  The only difference is a minor change in the `Return From Keyword If` statement (using `==` vs `=`). This Robot Framework resource file defines keywords for common alarm-related operations, primarily focused on handling default password alarms.  It uses the `AlarmHandlerLib.py` library and includes keywords to append default password alarms to a list (`Append Default Password Alarms`).

Finally, at 9:07:26 AM, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` was modified. This Robot Framework test suite verifies alarm handling on a High Availability (HA) router.  It uses several libraries (including `AlarmHandlerLib.py`, `LinuxLib.py`, `SSHLib.py`, etc.) and resources (like `AlarmCommon.robot`).  The test cases focus on verifying alarm counts under various network conditions (e.g.,  connectivity loss to conductor nodes) and verifying that default password alarms are cleared after password updates.  The tests manipulate network interfaces (`kniTest`), use a defined topology (`topologies/four_duts/ConductorHAToComboHA.robot`), and employ keywords from `AlarmCommon.robot` to manage expected and ignored alarms.  The recurring use of `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` indicates a focus on reliable and robust test execution.


## 11:11:39 AM
The Robot Framework code modifications on March 10th, 2025, involved updates to two key files: `SpirentScaling.robot` and `AlarmShelving.robot`.

`SpirentScaling.robot` (10:17:55 AM) underwent a major update, focusing on performance testing with Spirent traffic generators.  The changes introduce multiple test cases designed to measure throughput under various conditions (eBGP, iBGP, UDP IMIX, and maximum sessions).  These tests extensively utilize various libraries for network management (BGP, OSPF, SSH, REST), data collection, and ELK logging. The code includes detailed variable definitions for different parameters like topology, session counts, thresholds for CPU and memory utilization, and configurations for Spirent.  The test cases involve setting up and tearing down BGP and OSPF connections, sending traffic, capturing performance statistics, and performing alarm suppression/encouragement tests.  A significant amount of tagging is used for categorization and reporting.


`AlarmShelving.robot` (10:19:15 AM) focuses on verifying the alarm shelving functionality. The updated file includes test cases for verifying alarm shelving based on various criteria: router name, node name, category, severity, and message using both exact match and regular expressions.  It uses functions to add and delete alarm shelves, then verifies whether specific alarms are shelved or unshelved as expected. The test suite leverages several libraries for interacting with the system under test (including user management, Linux, SSH, and T128 connectivity).  A section related to resource-based shelving is commented out, suggesting it may be undergoing development or debugging.  The consistent use of "nightly_stable" tags suggests these tests are critical to nightly builds.

Both files share common elements like using `BaseSuiteVariables.robot`  and libraries like `InitRobot.py`, `AlarmHandlerLib.py`, and `T128.py`, indicating a shared framework for testing.  The short time interval between modifications suggests a coordinated effort in updating related test suites.
