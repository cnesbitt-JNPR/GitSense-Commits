# Activity Summary for 3/10/2025

## 9:11:40 AM
The code changes log shows development on alarm handling within a system, likely for testing purposes.

On March 10th, 2025,  `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py` was updated at 8:23:59 AM. This file contains a Python library for handling alarms.  Key features include an `Alarm` class to represent individual alarms (with attributes like ID, node, time, message, severity, and shelved status), and functions to retrieve alarms (`get_all_alarms`, `get_current_alarms`, `get_shelved_alarms`), filter alarms by time range (`get_alarms_for_given_time_range`), and specifically handle default password alarms (`get_default_password_alarms`, etc.).  The library interacts with a REST API (`RestLib`) to fetch alarm data.

Two nearly identical updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot` occurred at 8:54:50 AM and 8:55:15 AM.  The only difference is a minor change in the `Return From Keyword If` statement (using `==` vs `=`). This Robot Framework resource file defines keywords for common alarm-related operations, primarily focused on handling default password alarms.  It uses the `AlarmHandlerLib.py` library and includes keywords to append default password alarms to a list (`Append Default Password Alarms`).

Finally, at 9:07:26 AM, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` was modified. This Robot Framework test suite verifies alarm handling on a High Availability (HA) router.  It uses several libraries (including `AlarmHandlerLib.py`, `LinuxLib.py`, `SSHLib.py`, etc.) and resources (like `AlarmCommon.robot`).  The test cases focus on verifying alarm counts under various network conditions (e.g.,  connectivity loss to conductor nodes) and verifying that default password alarms are cleared after password updates.  The tests manipulate network interfaces (`kniTest`), use a defined topology (`topologies/four_duts/ConductorHAToComboHA.robot`), and employ keywords from `AlarmCommon.robot` to manage expected and ignored alarms.  The recurring use of `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` indicates a focus on reliable and robust test execution.
