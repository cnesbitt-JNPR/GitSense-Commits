# Activity Summary for 3/11/2025

## 8:11:38 AM
The log shows two updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot`, both within a minute of each other (8:04:26 AM and 8:04:55 AM on March 11, 2025).  Both updates contain identical code.  The file is a Robot Framework resource file defining a keyword, `Append Default Password Alarms`. This keyword searches for default password alarms across specified devices, appends them to a given alarm list, and returns the updated list.  The keyword uses several other keywords, including `Check For Default Password Alarms`, `Get Default Password Alarms`, and internal Robot Framework functions like `Run Keyword And Ignore Error`, `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds`, `Get Length`, `Set Variable`, `Create Dictionary`, and `Append To List`. The keyword handles optional parameters (`use_legacy_parameters` and `use_top_level_alarm_endpoint`).  The lack of any difference between the two commits suggests a possible accidental double commit or a version control artifact rather than a meaningful code change.


## 11:11:39 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/config/ConfigObjects.cpp` on March 11, 2025, at 11:03:30 AM.  This file contains the implementation of the `config::Objects` class, which appears to manage configuration data.  The class interacts with a persistent data accessor (likely a database or similar), handles configuration updates (`onConfigDataChange`), processes these updates (`handleConfigChange`, `processConfig`), and manages several configuration tables (e.g., `authorityTable`, `trafficProfileTable`).

Key updates include:

* **Configuration Update Handling:** The `onConfigDataChange` method receives configuration updates, parses them using `config::ConfigData::parseSystemJson`, and calls `handleConfigChange` for processing. `handleConfigChange` compares the new configuration with the previous one, using `config::ConfigDiff::diffConfigData`.  If a difference is detected, it notifies observers (`notifyObservers`), processes the changes (`processConfig`), and updates the internal configuration.

* **Version Handling:** The `processVersion` method retrieves the configuration version, handling both a new `version_ms` field and a legacy `version` field.  The version is crucial for tracking configuration changes.

* **Table Management:**  The `clearTables` method clears all configuration tables managed by the class.

* **Logging:** Extensive use of logging statements (`DebugLog`, `InfoLog`, `TraceLog`) is present throughout the code, providing detailed information about the configuration update process.

The code suggests a system that regularly receives and processes configuration updates, maintaining a consistent state across multiple tables. The presence of observer pattern (`pattern::Subject<config::ObjectsObserver>`) indicates that other parts of the system are notified of configuration changes.  The use of error handling (`CATCH_ALL_LOG`) and assertions (`assert`) is notable.  The `t128token` variable suggests that the configuration might be related to a specific system or component identified by `t128`.  There are also several TODO comments, indicating areas requiring further attention.
