# Activity Summary for 3/11/2025

## 8:11:38 AM
The log shows two updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot`, both within a minute of each other (8:04:26 AM and 8:04:55 AM on March 11, 2025).  Both updates contain identical code.  The file is a Robot Framework resource file defining a keyword, `Append Default Password Alarms`. This keyword searches for default password alarms across specified devices, appends them to a given alarm list, and returns the updated list.  The keyword uses several other keywords, including `Check For Default Password Alarms`, `Get Default Password Alarms`, and internal Robot Framework functions like `Run Keyword And Ignore Error`, `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds`, `Get Length`, `Set Variable`, `Create Dictionary`, and `Append To List`. The keyword handles optional parameters (`use_legacy_parameters` and `use_top_level_alarm_endpoint`).  The lack of any difference between the two commits suggests a possible accidental double commit or a version control artifact rather than a meaningful code change.
