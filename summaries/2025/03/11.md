# Activity Summary for 3/11/2025

## 8:11:38 AM
The log shows two updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot`, both within a minute of each other (8:04:26 AM and 8:04:55 AM on March 11, 2025).  Both updates contain identical code.  The file is a Robot Framework resource file defining a keyword, `Append Default Password Alarms`. This keyword searches for default password alarms across specified devices, appends them to a given alarm list, and returns the updated list.  The keyword uses several other keywords, including `Check For Default Password Alarms`, `Get Default Password Alarms`, and internal Robot Framework functions like `Run Keyword And Ignore Error`, `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds`, `Get Length`, `Set Variable`, `Create Dictionary`, and `Append To List`. The keyword handles optional parameters (`use_legacy_parameters` and `use_top_level_alarm_endpoint`).  The lack of any difference between the two commits suggests a possible accidental double commit or a version control artifact rather than a meaningful code change.


## 11:11:39 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/config/ConfigObjects.cpp` on March 11, 2025, at 11:03:30 AM.  This file contains the implementation of the `config::Objects` class, which appears to manage configuration data.  The class interacts with a persistent data accessor (likely a database or similar), handles configuration updates (`onConfigDataChange`), processes these updates (`handleConfigChange`, `processConfig`), and manages several configuration tables (e.g., `authorityTable`, `trafficProfileTable`).

Key updates include:

* **Configuration Update Handling:** The `onConfigDataChange` method receives configuration updates, parses them using `config::ConfigData::parseSystemJson`, and calls `handleConfigChange` for processing. `handleConfigChange` compares the new configuration with the previous one, using `config::ConfigDiff::diffConfigData`.  If a difference is detected, it notifies observers (`notifyObservers`), processes the changes (`processConfig`), and updates the internal configuration.

* **Version Handling:** The `processVersion` method retrieves the configuration version, handling both a new `version_ms` field and a legacy `version` field.  The version is crucial for tracking configuration changes.

* **Table Management:**  The `clearTables` method clears all configuration tables managed by the class.

* **Logging:** Extensive use of logging statements (`DebugLog`, `InfoLog`, `TraceLog`) is present throughout the code, providing detailed information about the configuration update process.

The code suggests a system that regularly receives and processes configuration updates, maintaining a consistent state across multiple tables. The presence of observer pattern (`pattern::Subject<config::ObjectsObserver>`) indicates that other parts of the system are notified of configuration changes.  The use of error handling (`CATCH_ALL_LOG`) and assertions (`assert`) is notable.  The `t128token` variable suggests that the configuration might be related to a specific system or component identified by `t128`.  There are also several TODO comments, indicating areas requiring further attention.


## 1:11:39 PM
The log shows code changes on March 11, 2025, affecting two files: `ConfigDiff.cpp` and `NodeMonitorTest.cpp`.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/config/ConfigDiff.cpp` (12:11:46 PM): This file contains a comprehensive implementation of a `ConfigDiff` class.  The class's main functions are `flattenConfigData` and `diffConfigData`, which recursively traverse JSON configuration data structures to create flattened representations and compute differences between two configurations.  The code extensively uses the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON manipulation and incorporates error handling for invalid JSON types.  The difference calculation handles various JSON types (objects, arrays, primitives) and distinguishes between adding, removing, and modifying elements within configurations.  The functions also handle specific keys based on `ConfigKeys` for specialized behavior.  Extensive use of assertions and exception handling ensures code robustness.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/NodeMonitorTest.cpp` (1:00:07 PM): This file contains unit tests for a `NodeMonitor` class using the Google Test framework.  The tests cover various aspects of the NodeMonitor including: CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk utilization, and auditing functionalities (using a `FakeAuditdReceiver`).  Test setup includes configuring and loading the `NodeMonitor`, using mocks (`MockTankClient`) for dependencies and manipulating configuration via `ConfigUtil`.  Tests extensively use `dolly::dynamic` for JSON parsing and comparison.  `NodeMonitorTest` includes functions to simulate different audit scenarios (admin, system events), and test the consumption of audit log files with rate limiting considerations, handling of incomplete files, and the handling of NTP configuration.  Tests for scraping version info from files are included, handling both successfully formatted files, and files requiring escaping.  The tests showcase thorough testing of the system's capabilities and error handling.  A noteworthy pattern is the consistent use of `EXPECT_EQ` and `EXPECT_BECOMES_EQ` assertions for verifying expected behaviors. The tests also use `dolly::parseJson` and `dolly::toPrettyJsonStd` for JSON manipulation.
