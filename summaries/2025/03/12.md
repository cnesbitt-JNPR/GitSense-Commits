# Activity Summary for 3/12/2025

## 10:47:32 AM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot`, a Robot Framework resource file, focusing on the `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword.

Between 10:28 AM and 10:33 AM, the file underwent several revisions.  Initially,  `Append Default Password Alarms`  was a complex keyword that searched for and appended default password alarms to a list.  A legacy version, `Append Default Password Alarms Legacy`, performed the same function.  Around 10:31 AM, a significant change occurred: a simpler keyword, `Append To List`, was introduced, directly appending a pre-defined  `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM` dictionary. This was a simplification aimed at deprecating the older, more complex keywords.  The `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM` dictionary itself was slightly modified during this period; specifically, the `message` field was added to the variable's definition.

By 10:44 AM, the `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword's documentation was updated to reflect its transitionary status and encourage users to directly use `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM`. The subsequent changes between 10:44 AM and 10:46 AM refined the formatting and syntax around the `&{DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM}` variable declaration within the `***Variables***` section, ensuring consistency.  The `Append Default Password Alarms Old` keyword remained largely unchanged throughout this process, serving as a backup or for reference.  The overall pattern reveals a refactoring effort simplifying alarm handling by promoting direct use of a pre-defined alarm dictionary instead of the older, more complex keyword.


## 11:47:31 AM
The Robot Framework file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot` was updated on March 12, 2025, at 10:48:04 AM.  The key change is a refactoring of the `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword.  A new implementation directly uses the `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM` variable, while the older `Append Default Password Alarms Old` keyword is marked as transitional and slated for removal.  The new version simplifies the process, avoiding the previous keyword's more complex logic involving checking for default passwords and explicitly fetching them.  The updated keyword uses `Append To List` for adding alarms, and the code includes detailed documentation explaining the changes and intended usage.  The new keyword uses parameters to maintain backward compatibility with `use_legacy_parameters` and `use_top_level_alarm_endpoint`.


## 2:47:32 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` underwent a minor update between 1:56:38 PM and 1:59:27 PM on March 12, 2025.  The primary change involves the handling of default password alarms within the `Verify Current Alarms` keyword.  Initially,  `@{ignored_alarms}` was populated using `Append Default Password Alarms ${ignored_alarms} ${ALL_DEVICES}`. This was replaced with `${DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM}` and in several instances, `Append To List ${ignored_alarms} ${DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM}`. This suggests a refactoring to handle default password alarms more cleanly using a pre-defined variable `${DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM}` instead of a function call. The rest of the file, including test cases focused on verifying alarm counts under various network connectivity scenarios (e.g., dropping conductor traffic), remained unchanged.  The consistent use of keywords like `Wait For Stable Connectivity Between All Duts`, `Add Kni Interface`, `Delete Kni Interface`, and the 3-minute timeout in `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` indicates a structured approach to testing network stability and alarm behavior.  The test suite heavily uses various DUTs (devices under test) numbered 1 through 4, suggesting a multi-device testing environment.


## 2:49:37 PM
The log shows Robot Framework test suite modifications across several files between 1:50 PM and 2:20 PM on March 12, 2025.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/performance/SpirentHACapacity/SpirentHACapacity.robot` file underwent two nearly identical updates within a minute of each other (1:50:31 PM and 1:51:04 PM). These changes involved minimal alterations to the  `Upgrade Primary Conductor And Verify Version` and `Upgrade Secondary Conductor And Verify Version` test cases; specifically, the removal of  `&{DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM}` from the `ignored_alarms` list within each test case.  The rest of the file, containing numerous test cases related to Spirent HA capacity,  versions, and traffic sampling remained unchanged.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/solutions/BasicSvr/BasicSvr.robot` file was updated at 1:53:31 PM and again at 2:01:39 PM. The updates seem to be unrelated to each other and involved no significant structural changes. The first update seems to simply add more test cases and keywords while the second update seems to be minor formatting or whitespace changes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/solutions/BgpVrf/BgpVrf.robot` file had updates at 1:54:12 PM and 2:01:33 PM, both with no significant content changes. The changes seem to be minor corrections and/or addition of whitespace.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/solutions/CMC/CMC.robot` file shows updates at 1:56:13 PM and 2:01:20 PM.  Similar to the previous files, the changes in this file do not seem to be significantly structural or content changes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/solutions/Hospital/Hospital.robot` file shows two updates very close in time (2:00:55 PM and 2:01:02 PM).  Again, the updates involved no significant changes to the test suite's structure or logic, appearing to be minor formatting adjustments.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/BGP/Bgp.robot` file had a single update at 2:20:59 PM. The update is seemingly unrelated to previous updates and is a large file with many test cases, but no large structural changes were made.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/BGP/BgpVrf.robot` file has two updates at 2:04:07 PM and 2:04:42 PM.  The content updates seem to be minimal.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/RappidDirector/RappidApplications.robot` file shows two updates at 2:12:44 PM and 2:13:01 PM with minimal differences between the two updates. The updates seem to be simply formatting changes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` file has three updates at 2:13:27 PM, 2:13:47 PM, and 2:14:05 PM.  These are seemingly minor formatting changes without altering the logic.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Vrrp/VrrpAlarm.robot` file has two updates at 2:15:01 PM and 2:15:18 PM. The updates seem to be minor adjustments to the test cases with little structural difference between the two.

Finally, the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot` file had three updates (2:15:33 PM, 2:15:39 PM, and 2:20:18 PM) that were primarily documentation updates clarifying the handling of default password alarms.  The actual variable definition remained largely unchanged.

In summary, most of the changes were minor, likely related to bug fixes, formatting, or documentation improvements. The most notable change was the adjustment of the `ignored_alarms` list in the `SpirentHACapacity.robot` file.  The majority of changes happened in a short time frame, suggesting a potential batch update or a period of active debugging and testing.


## 3:47:32 PM
The log shows two files related to Python package requirements.  `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/tools/python3/requirements.ssr.in` (updated 3/12/2025, 3:06:52 PM) contains a base set of dependencies, including libraries for testing (Robot Framework related packages), service clients (pysnmp, pyasn1), development tools (meson, flake8, pylint), and other utilities (e.g., cryptography, protobuf).

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/tools/python3/requirements.txt` (updated 3/12/2025, 3:07:35 PM) is a more comprehensive file, automatically generated.  It lists many additional dependencies, many with comments indicating their origin (e.g., which package depends on them). The file's header indicates it is managed by `pip-compile`. Notably, several packages listed in `requirements.ssr.in` are also present here, suggesting that `requirements.txt` extends the dependency list from `requirements.ssr.in`.  Many OpenStack related libraries (e.g., `openstacksdk`, multiple client libraries) are included.  The presence of `opentelemetry` packages suggests instrumentation for telemetry is used.

The timestamps show that `requirements.txt` was updated shortly after `requirements.ssr.in`, indicating a likely automated process of incorporating the base dependencies into a full list.  The recurring element is the use of many open-source Python libraries within a system for testing and managing infrastructure.


## 3:49:27 PM
The log shows Robot Framework test suite modifications across several files on March 12, 2025.  The changes primarily involve testing various functionalities, including application director features (RappidApplications.robot), VRRP failover and alarms (VrrpAlarm.robot), Spirent scaling performance (SpirentScaling.robot), basic SVR Ixia configuration (BasicSvrIxiaC.robot), and alarm shelving mechanisms (AlarmShelving.robot), along with PIM MSDP alarm verification (PimMsdpAlarms.robot).

**RappidApplications.robot (3/12/2025, 3:16:18 PM):** This file contains numerous test cases focused on verifying RappidDirector application management, including in-memory database usage, module updates, alias applications, and handling invalid applications.  The tests heavily utilize Robot Framework keywords for CLI interaction, REST API calls, and alarm verification.  Recurring elements include verification steps for registered application modules and alarm checks.  The tags `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` suggest these tests are part of a nightly build process for stable releases on RHEL.

**VrrpAlarm.robot (3/12/2025, 3:18:45 PM and 3/12/2025, 3:24:59 PM):** This file underwent two updates within a short time frame. The tests focus on VRRP functionality, specifically verifying alarm behavior during failover scenarios and audit event generation. It uses keywords for interface manipulation, alarm checks, and event handling.  The `nightly_stable` tag indicates these are also part of the nightly build process.  The second update likely involved minor corrections or additions to existing tests.

**SpirentScaling.robot (3/12/2025, 3:20:35 PM and 3/12/2025, 3:21:11 PM):** This file, also with two closely-timed updates, contains performance tests using Spirent traffic generators. The tests cover various scenarios including eBGP and iBGP route scaling, maximum peering path determination, and alarm suppression and encouragement mechanisms related to session counts. The tests use numerous libraries for BGP, OSPF, Spirent control, and data collection, suggesting comprehensive performance testing and analysis. The tags indicate that these are part of performance and throughput tests.  The duplicated entry suggests a potential mistake in the log or a very minor edit.

**BasicSvrIxiaC.robot (3/12/2025, 3:22:06 PM):** This file focuses on testing a basic SVR solution using Ixia as the traffic generator.  The tests check peer status, service paths, and traffic flow between routers. It uses both REST API calls and CLI commands for verification.

**AlarmShelving.robot (3/12/2025, 3:23:11 PM):** This file contains tests for alarm shelving functionality.  Tests are designed to verify shelving based on various criteria like router name, node name, category, severity, and message using regular expressions.  A commented-out section suggests planned future tests for resource shelving.

**PimMsdpAlarms.robot (3/12/2025, 3:24:37 PM):** This file is dedicated to verifying MSDP peer functionality and associated alarms within a PIM context. The tests cover scenarios like peers dropping from the established state and peers failing to reach the established state, along with combined BGP and MSDP alarm verification.


Overall, the log demonstrates a substantial amount of automated testing across various network functionalities. The recurring use of `nightly_stable` and similar tags points to a robust continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. The heavy reliance on libraries and resources suggests a well-structured and modular test framework.
