# Activity Summary for 3/12/2025

## 10:47:32 AM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot`, a Robot Framework resource file, focusing on the `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword.

Between 10:28 AM and 10:33 AM, the file underwent several revisions.  Initially,  `Append Default Password Alarms`  was a complex keyword that searched for and appended default password alarms to a list.  A legacy version, `Append Default Password Alarms Legacy`, performed the same function.  Around 10:31 AM, a significant change occurred: a simpler keyword, `Append To List`, was introduced, directly appending a pre-defined  `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM` dictionary. This was a simplification aimed at deprecating the older, more complex keywords.  The `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM` dictionary itself was slightly modified during this period; specifically, the `message` field was added to the variable's definition.

By 10:44 AM, the `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword's documentation was updated to reflect its transitionary status and encourage users to directly use `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM`. The subsequent changes between 10:44 AM and 10:46 AM refined the formatting and syntax around the `&{DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM}` variable declaration within the `***Variables***` section, ensuring consistency.  The `Append Default Password Alarms Old` keyword remained largely unchanged throughout this process, serving as a backup or for reference.  The overall pattern reveals a refactoring effort simplifying alarm handling by promoting direct use of a pre-defined alarm dictionary instead of the older, more complex keyword.


## 11:47:31 AM
The Robot Framework file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot` was updated on March 12, 2025, at 10:48:04 AM.  The key change is a refactoring of the `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword.  A new implementation directly uses the `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM` variable, while the older `Append Default Password Alarms Old` keyword is marked as transitional and slated for removal.  The new version simplifies the process, avoiding the previous keyword's more complex logic involving checking for default passwords and explicitly fetching them.  The updated keyword uses `Append To List` for adding alarms, and the code includes detailed documentation explaining the changes and intended usage.  The new keyword uses parameters to maintain backward compatibility with `use_legacy_parameters` and `use_top_level_alarm_endpoint`.


## 2:47:32 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmHA.robot` underwent a minor update between 1:56:38 PM and 1:59:27 PM on March 12, 2025.  The primary change involves the handling of default password alarms within the `Verify Current Alarms` keyword.  Initially,  `@{ignored_alarms}` was populated using `Append Default Password Alarms ${ignored_alarms} ${ALL_DEVICES}`. This was replaced with `${DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM}` and in several instances, `Append To List ${ignored_alarms} ${DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM}`. This suggests a refactoring to handle default password alarms more cleanly using a pre-defined variable `${DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM}` instead of a function call. The rest of the file, including test cases focused on verifying alarm counts under various network connectivity scenarios (e.g., dropping conductor traffic), remained unchanged.  The consistent use of keywords like `Wait For Stable Connectivity Between All Duts`, `Add Kni Interface`, `Delete Kni Interface`, and the 3-minute timeout in `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` indicates a structured approach to testing network stability and alarm behavior.  The test suite heavily uses various DUTs (devices under test) numbered 1 through 4, suggesting a multi-device testing environment.


## 2:49:37 PM
The log shows Robot Framework test suite modifications across several files between 1:50 PM and 2:20 PM on March 12, 2025.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/performance/SpirentHACapacity/SpirentHACapacity.robot` file underwent two nearly identical updates within a minute of each other (1:50:31 PM and 1:51:04 PM). These changes involved minimal alterations to the  `Upgrade Primary Conductor And Verify Version` and `Upgrade Secondary Conductor And Verify Version` test cases; specifically, the removal of  `&{DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM}` from the `ignored_alarms` list within each test case.  The rest of the file, containing numerous test cases related to Spirent HA capacity,  versions, and traffic sampling remained unchanged.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/solutions/BasicSvr/BasicSvr.robot` file was updated at 1:53:31 PM and again at 2:01:39 PM. The updates seem to be unrelated to each other and involved no significant structural changes. The first update seems to simply add more test cases and keywords while the second update seems to be minor formatting or whitespace changes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/solutions/BgpVrf/BgpVrf.robot` file had updates at 1:54:12 PM and 2:01:33 PM, both with no significant content changes. The changes seem to be minor corrections and/or addition of whitespace.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/solutions/CMC/CMC.robot` file shows updates at 1:56:13 PM and 2:01:20 PM.  Similar to the previous files, the changes in this file do not seem to be significantly structural or content changes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/solutions/Hospital/Hospital.robot` file shows two updates very close in time (2:00:55 PM and 2:01:02 PM).  Again, the updates involved no significant changes to the test suite's structure or logic, appearing to be minor formatting adjustments.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/BGP/Bgp.robot` file had a single update at 2:20:59 PM. The update is seemingly unrelated to previous updates and is a large file with many test cases, but no large structural changes were made.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/BGP/BgpVrf.robot` file has two updates at 2:04:07 PM and 2:04:42 PM.  The content updates seem to be minimal.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Conductor/ConductorHATest.robot` file was updated once at 2:07:02 PM. This file contains tests related to HA Conductor synchronization, and the update did not introduce major changes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Conductor/ConductorServiceFailoverTest.robot` file shows a single update at 2:07:46 PM, focusing on conductor service failover tests, without major content alterations.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Conductor/ConductorStandaloneTest.robot` file was updated only once at 2:08:34 PM, containing tests for standalone conductor synchronization, and showing no major content changes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Conductor/RouterMaintenanceMode.robot` file has one update at 2:09:07 PM, related to router maintenance mode and alarm shelving, showing no major structural changes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Conductor/RouterVrfMaintenanceMode.robot` file has a single update at 2:09:35 PM, concerning router VRF maintenance mode, showing no major changes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/DHCP/BasicDhcpHA.robot` file had two updates, at 2:11:09 PM and 2:11:31 PM.  These updates seem to be unrelated and involved only minor changes in formatting or whitespace.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/RappidDirector/RappidApplications.robot` file shows two updates at 2:12:44 PM and 2:13:01 PM with minimal differences between the two updates. The updates seem to be simply formatting changes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` file has three updates at 2:13:27 PM, 2:13:47 PM, and 2:14:05 PM.  These are seemingly minor formatting changes without altering the logic.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Vrrp/VrrpAlarm.robot` file has two updates at 2:15:01 PM and 2:15:18 PM. The updates seem to be minor adjustments to the test cases with little structural difference between the two.

Finally, the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot` file had three updates (2:15:33 PM, 2:15:39 PM, and 2:20:18 PM) that were primarily documentation updates clarifying the handling of default password alarms.  The actual variable definition remained largely unchanged.

In summary, most of the changes were minor, likely related to bug fixes, formatting, or documentation improvements. The most notable change was the adjustment of the `ignored_alarms` list in the `SpirentHACapacity.robot` file.  The majority of changes happened in a short time frame, suggesting a potential batch update or a period of active debugging and testing.
