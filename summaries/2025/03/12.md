# Activity Summary for 3/12/2025

## 10:47:32 AM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot`, a Robot Framework resource file, focusing on the `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword.

Between 10:28 AM and 10:33 AM, the file underwent several revisions.  Initially,  `Append Default Password Alarms`  was a complex keyword that searched for and appended default password alarms to a list.  A legacy version, `Append Default Password Alarms Legacy`, performed the same function.  Around 10:31 AM, a significant change occurred: a simpler keyword, `Append To List`, was introduced, directly appending a pre-defined  `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM` dictionary. This was a simplification aimed at deprecating the older, more complex keywords.  The `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM` dictionary itself was slightly modified during this period; specifically, the `message` field was added to the variable's definition.

By 10:44 AM, the `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword's documentation was updated to reflect its transitionary status and encourage users to directly use `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM`. The subsequent changes between 10:44 AM and 10:46 AM refined the formatting and syntax around the `&{DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM}` variable declaration within the `***Variables***` section, ensuring consistency.  The `Append Default Password Alarms Old` keyword remained largely unchanged throughout this process, serving as a backup or for reference.  The overall pattern reveals a refactoring effort simplifying alarm handling by promoting direct use of a pre-defined alarm dictionary instead of the older, more complex keyword.
