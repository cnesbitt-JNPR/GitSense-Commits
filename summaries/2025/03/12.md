# Activity Summary for 3/12/2025

## 10:47:32 AM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot`, a Robot Framework resource file, focusing on the `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword.

Between 10:28 AM and 10:33 AM, the file underwent several revisions.  Initially,  `Append Default Password Alarms`  was a complex keyword that searched for and appended default password alarms to a list.  A legacy version, `Append Default Password Alarms Legacy`, performed the same function.  Around 10:31 AM, a significant change occurred: a simpler keyword, `Append To List`, was introduced, directly appending a pre-defined  `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM` dictionary. This was a simplification aimed at deprecating the older, more complex keywords.  The `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM` dictionary itself was slightly modified during this period; specifically, the `message` field was added to the variable's definition.

By 10:44 AM, the `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword's documentation was updated to reflect its transitionary status and encourage users to directly use `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM`. The subsequent changes between 10:44 AM and 10:46 AM refined the formatting and syntax around the `&{DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM}` variable declaration within the `***Variables***` section, ensuring consistency.  The `Append Default Password Alarms Old` keyword remained largely unchanged throughout this process, serving as a backup or for reference.  The overall pattern reveals a refactoring effort simplifying alarm handling by promoting direct use of a pre-defined alarm dictionary instead of the older, more complex keyword.

The Robot Framework file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/resources/AlarmCommon.robot` was updated on March 12, 2025, at 10:48:04 AM.  The key change is a refactoring of the `Append Default Password Alarms` keyword.  A new implementation directly uses the `DEFAULT_PASSWORD_ALARM` variable, while the older `Append Default Password Alarms Old` keyword is marked as transitional and slated for removal.  The new version simplifies the process, avoiding the previous keyword's more complex logic involving checking for default passwords and explicitly fetching them.  The updated keyword uses `Append To List` for adding alarms, and the code includes detailed documentation explaining the changes and intended usage.  The new keyword uses parameters to maintain backward compatibility with `use_legacy_parameters` and `use_top_level_alarm_endpoint`.
