# Activity Summary for 3/13/2025

## 8:47:33 AM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` file underwent two revisions on March 13th, 2025.  The second revision, at 8:47:16 AM,  removed  `EXPECT_EQ(expectedAlarm->getCategory(), actualAlarm->getCategory());` and `EXPECT_EQ(expectedAlarm->getSource(), actualAlarm->getSource());` and `EXPECT_EQ(expectedAlarm->getWatchPath(), actualAlarm->getWatchPath());` from the `expectAlarmsEqual` function. This suggests a simplification of the alarm comparison logic, focusing only on severity, value, and message.

The code is primarily a series of unit tests for a `SystemChangeHandler` class, which appears to manage system alarms based on state changes.  The tests cover various scenarios, including:

* **Version Mismatch Alarms:** Tests for adding, clearing, and handling version mismatch alarms on one or multiple nodes.  The `processAlarmOnNodeDeletion` function is also tested for clearing alarms when a node is deleted.

* **CPU Usage Alarms:**  Tests for CPU usage alarms, incorporating a debounce mechanism (30 iterations before triggering an alarm).  Different scenarios are tested, including the presence or absence of isolation/dedication masks for CPU cores.

* **Config Node Utilization Alarms:** Tests for alarms related to config node utilization, testing both exceeding and not exceeding the threshold.

* **Application ID Cache Utilization Alarms:** Tests for alarms related to application ID cache utilization, showing `Action::Event` handling.

* **Parameterized Test:** A parameterized test (`SystemAlarmClearedByNodeDeleteTest`) uses  `std::tuple` to test `processAlarmOnNodeDeletion` with various system state keys (disk, memory, connections, DNS, AppID cache) and their corresponding values and expected actions.


The code extensively uses the `EXPECT_EQ` macro from Google Test to assert the expected behavior of the `SystemChangeHandler`.  The `alarms::Action` enum (with values like `Add`, `Clear`, `None`, `Event`) plays a central role in defining the actions taken by the handler based on state changes.  The consistent use of `buildSystemStatePathInfo` suggests a standardized way to create state path information for testing.  The `getExpected...Alarm` functions are helper functions that create expected alarm objects for comparisons in the tests.
