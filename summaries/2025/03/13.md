# Activity Summary for 3/13/2025

## 8:47:33 AM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` file underwent two revisions on March 13th, 2025.  The second revision, at 8:47:16 AM,  removed  `EXPECT_EQ(expectedAlarm->getCategory(), actualAlarm->getCategory());` and `EXPECT_EQ(expectedAlarm->getSource(), actualAlarm->getSource());` and `EXPECT_EQ(expectedAlarm->getWatchPath(), actualAlarm->getWatchPath());` from the `expectAlarmsEqual` function. This suggests a simplification of the alarm comparison logic, focusing only on severity, value, and message.

The code is primarily a series of unit tests for a `SystemChangeHandler` class, which appears to manage system alarms based on state changes.  The tests cover various scenarios, including:

* **Version Mismatch Alarms:** Tests for adding, clearing, and handling version mismatch alarms on one or multiple nodes.  The `processAlarmOnNodeDeletion` function is also tested for clearing alarms when a node is deleted.

* **CPU Usage Alarms:**  Tests for CPU usage alarms, incorporating a debounce mechanism (30 iterations before triggering an alarm).  Different scenarios are tested, including the presence or absence of isolation/dedication masks for CPU cores.

* **Config Node Utilization Alarms:** Tests for alarms related to config node utilization, testing both exceeding and not exceeding the threshold.

* **Application ID Cache Utilization Alarms:** Tests for alarms related to application ID cache utilization, showing `Action::Event` handling.

* **Parameterized Test:** A parameterized test (`SystemAlarmClearedByNodeDeleteTest`) uses  `std::tuple` to test `processAlarmOnNodeDeletion` with various system state keys (disk, memory, connections, DNS, AppID cache) and their corresponding values and expected actions.


The code extensively uses the `EXPECT_EQ` macro from Google Test to assert the expected behavior of the `SystemChangeHandler`.  The `alarms::Action` enum (with values like `Add`, `Clear`, `None`, `Event`) plays a central role in defining the actions taken by the handler based on state changes.  The consistent use of `buildSystemStatePathInfo` suggests a standardized way to create state path information for testing.  The `getExpected...Alarm` functions are helper functions that create expected alarm objects for comparisons in the tests.


## 9:47:36 AM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` file underwent multiple revisions on March 13th, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was enhancing the unit tests for the `SystemChangeHandler` class, specifically improving alarm comparison logic.

Initially, the `expectAlarmsEqual` function only compared a subset of alarm fields.  Subsequent revisions progressively added more comprehensive comparisons, including  `getSeverity()`, `getValue()`, `getMessage()`, `getWatchPath()`, and finally `getStateWatchPath()`.  This evolution indicates a concerted effort to ensure more robust and accurate testing of alarm creation and handling.

The `getExpectedVersionMismatchedAlarm` function was significantly altered.  It started by directly using the input `version` string as the alarm's value. Later revisions parsed the JSON input (`dolly::parseJson(version)["version"].asStdString()`), extracting only the "version" field to be used in the alarm value.  Furthermore, the alarm message was refined, initially being a placeholder string ("message"), then evolving to include the node name and version details, and finally incorporating the peer version for more informative error reporting. The `testStateWatchPath` was added to the `getExpectedVersionMismatchedAlarm` and `getExpectedAppIdUtilizationAlarm` functions improving the accuracy of the test.  The `expectAlarmsEqual` function's name was changed to clarify its purpose.

A consistent pattern across the changes is the iterative refinement of test cases.  The code shows a progression from simpler assertions to more complex checks, aiming for better test coverage and more meaningful error reporting within the alarm system.  The addition of a `peerVersion` parameter to `getExpectedVersionMismatchedAlarm` suggests an enhancement to the alarm handling to accommodate High Availability (HA) scenarios.  Throughout the revisions, many `// todo: compare alarms` comments remain, suggesting ongoing work in perfecting the alarm comparison aspects of the test suite.  The final commit at 9:42:10 AM shows the most complete implementation of alarm comparison, using `getStateWatchPath()` instead of `getWatchPath()`.


## 10:47:33 AM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` file underwent several revisions on March 13, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be enhancements to the unit tests for the `SystemChangeHandler` class.

Specifically, the `expectAlarmsEqual` function was modified in multiple commits. Initially, it only compared  `category`, `nodeName`, `source`, and `interfaceName` of alarms.  Later revisions added comparisons for `stateKeyName`, `severity`, `value`, and `message`.  The comparison of `WatchPath` was removed due to it not being populated in the tests.

The timestamps show a series of modifications between 10:29 AM and 10:44 AM, suggesting iterative debugging and refinement of the test suite.  Each commit involved minor adjustments to the unit tests, primarily focusing on ensuring comprehensive comparison of alarms within the `expectAlarmsEqual` function. The tests cover various scenarios including version mismatch alarms (single and multiple nodes, clearing), CPU usage alarms (with and without isolation masks, debouncing), config node utilization alarms, application ID cache utilization events, and alarm clearing upon node deletion. A pattern of adding and removing assertions for thoroughness is evident throughout the changes.  The `// todo: compare alarms` comments indicate areas where additional comparisons might be added in future revisions.
