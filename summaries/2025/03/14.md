# Activity Summary for 3/14/2025

## 2:47:39 PM
The provided log shows three revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`, all within a short time frame on March 14, 2025.  The file contains unit tests for a `SystemChangeHandler` class, which appears to manage system alarms.  The tests cover various scenarios:

* **Version Mismatch Alarms:** Tests verify the correct `Add` and `Clear` actions for version mismatch alarms based on state changes in one or two nodes (`nodeName1`, `nodeName2`).  `processAlarmOnNodeDeletion` is also tested for clearing alarms when a node is deleted.

* **CPU Usage Alarms:**  These tests extensively cover CPU usage alarm generation and clearing. A debounce mechanism (30 counts) is implemented before an alarm is triggered.  Tests distinguish between scenarios with and without CPU core isolation masks, showing different aggregated values (`cpuUtilizationTooHighAggrValue`, `cpuUtilizationTooHighAggrValueNoMask`) are used depending on the mask.

* **Config Node Utilization Alarms:**  Tests cover the addition of alarms when the config node utilization exceeds a threshold.

* **Application ID Cache Utilization Events:**  This section tests the generation of "Event" type alarms when the application ID cache utilization reaches a threshold.  The alarm is cleared when the utilization falls below the threshold.

There are no substantial structural changes across the three revisions; only a minor correction in the last line of the code (`expectAlarmsEqual(*expectedAlarm), *pAlarm)` to `expectAlarmsEqual(*expectedAlarm, *pAlarm)` is visible between the second and the third revision.  The timestamps indicate that the final revision occurred at 2:47:35 PM, suggesting a quick iteration cycle for fixing a minor syntax error.  The consistent use of `EXPECT_EQ` and `ASSERT_TRUE` from the Google Test framework indicates a structured testing approach.  The code heavily relies on the `AlarmFactory` and `SystemChangeHandler` classes, suggesting a well-defined alarm management system.


## 3:47:42 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/SystemTestLiterals.hpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` between 2:54 PM and 3:36 PM on March 14, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/SystemTestLiterals.hpp` primarily underwent changes related to how `memoryUtilizationValue` is calculated and defined. Initially, it was a `std::string` computed using `std::to_string(81/82*100)`.  This was then modified to use `dolly::to<std::string>(81/82*100)`, and finally to `dolly::to<std::string>(81.0/82*100)` to ensure floating-point division.  Additionally, a new constant `connectionErrorStatusValue` with the value "2" was added.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` remained largely unchanged across the various commits. The core functionality for alarm handling and testing, including the test cases for version mismatch, CPU usage, configuration node utilization, and application ID cache utilization, did not see any significant modifications to their logic.  The changes in `SystemTestLiterals.hpp` did not appear to impact the operation of the code in `SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`.  The file consistently uses a `debounceCount` of 30 in several test functions.
