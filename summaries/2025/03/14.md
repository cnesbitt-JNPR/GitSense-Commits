# Activity Summary for 3/14/2025

## 2:47:39 PM
The provided log shows three revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`, all within a short time frame on March 14, 2025.  The file contains unit tests for a `SystemChangeHandler` class, which appears to manage system alarms.  The tests cover various scenarios:

* **Version Mismatch Alarms:** Tests verify the correct `Add` and `Clear` actions for version mismatch alarms based on state changes in one or two nodes (`nodeName1`, `nodeName2`).  `processAlarmOnNodeDeletion` is also tested for clearing alarms when a node is deleted.

* **CPU Usage Alarms:**  These tests extensively cover CPU usage alarm generation and clearing. A debounce mechanism (30 counts) is implemented before an alarm is triggered.  Tests distinguish between scenarios with and without CPU core isolation masks, showing different aggregated values (`cpuUtilizationTooHighAggrValue`, `cpuUtilizationTooHighAggrValueNoMask`) are used depending on the mask.

* **Config Node Utilization Alarms:**  Tests cover the addition of alarms when the config node utilization exceeds a threshold.

* **Application ID Cache Utilization Events:**  This section tests the generation of "Event" type alarms when the application ID cache utilization reaches a threshold.  The alarm is cleared when the utilization falls below the threshold.

There are no substantial structural changes across the three revisions; only a minor correction in the last line of the code (`expectAlarmsEqual(*expectedAlarm), *pAlarm)` to `expectAlarmsEqual(*expectedAlarm, *pAlarm)` is visible between the second and the third revision.  The timestamps indicate that the final revision occurred at 2:47:35 PM, suggesting a quick iteration cycle for fixing a minor syntax error.  The consistent use of `EXPECT_EQ` and `ASSERT_TRUE` from the Google Test framework indicates a structured testing approach.  The code heavily relies on the `AlarmFactory` and `SystemChangeHandler` classes, suggesting a well-defined alarm management system.
