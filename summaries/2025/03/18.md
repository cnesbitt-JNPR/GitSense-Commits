# Activity Summary for 3/18/2025

## 1:18:16 PM
The log shows several revisions to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp` and one revision to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/CertificateManager.cpp`.

The `StateDataParser.cpp` file underwent multiple revisions between 12:21 PM and 12:26 PM on March 18, 2025.  These changes primarily involved additions of `DebugLog` statements within the `parseCertificateReport` function.  These debug logs track the execution flow, printing information about the `statusType`, `statusStr`, size of `certsArray`, and the building of `certsString`.  The core functionality of parsing different state data types (CPU utilization, disk utilization, connection status, etc.) remained consistent across all revisions.  The final revision added more detailed logging within the inner loop of `parseCertificateReport`.

The `CertificateManager.cpp` file was modified at 1:14:19 PM on March 18, 2025. This revision contains a substantial amount of code related to certificate management, including functions for starting and stopping timers (`RevocationTimer`, `CertificateReportTimer`), updating backoff and polling intervals, managing issuer endpoints, updating CA certificates and configured certificates, triggering CRL downloads, and generating certificate reports.  The `generateCertificateReportImpl` function is noteworthy, as it validates certificates against a CA certificate bundle and CRL bundle, categorizing them as valid, expiring soon, expired, or revoked.  The function then constructs a JSON report summarizing the certificate statuses. The code also includes a comment explaining the current method of gathering certificates (combining configured certificates and those ingested via a REST API).

The log shows modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/CertificateManager.cpp` on March 18, 2025, at 2:03:33 PM.  The code defines a `CertificateManager` class responsible for managing certificates, including their revocation and reporting.  Key functionalities include:

* **Certificate Validation and Reporting:** The `generateCertificateReportImpl` function validates certificates against a CA cert bundle and CRL bundle, categorizing them as valid, expiring (within a week or month), expired, or revoked.  The report is then sent to a `certificateStateUpdater`.

* **CRL Download Management:** A `crlDownloader` handles downloading Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).  The `updatePollingInterval` and `updateIssuerEndpoints` methods control the download frequency and endpoints.  The `triggerCrlDownloads` method initiates CRL downloads.

* **Timer Management:**  `RevocationTimer` and `CertificateReportTimer` manage the timing of CRL checks and certificate reports.  The code includes extensive error handling for timer operations.

* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Many operations, such as updating CA cert bundles and configured certificates, are performed asynchronously using `dolly::via(&threadPool)`.

* **Backoff Mechanism:** A backoff mechanism (`BackoffIntervalTimer`) is used to handle retry logic, potentially for CRL downloads.  A test mode allows for setting a static backoff interval.

* **Certificate Ingestion:** The `getAllCertificates` function gathers certificates from two sources: configured certificates and those ingested via REST API (stored on the file system).  The comment indicates that this part will need modification when file pointer datamodels are implemented for certificates.

The code extensively uses logging at different levels (InfoLog, DebugLog, ErrorLog, TraceLog) and employs various synchronization mechanisms (DSYNCHRONIZED) for thread safety.  The use of `dolly::dynamic` suggests a JSON-like data structure is used for certificate reports.  The code shows a robust approach to certificate management with features like asynchronous operations, error handling, and a comprehensive reporting mechanism.
