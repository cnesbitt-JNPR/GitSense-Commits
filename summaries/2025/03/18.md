# Activity Summary for 3/18/2025

## 1:18:16 PM
The log shows several revisions to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp` and one revision to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/CertificateManager.cpp`.

The `StateDataParser.cpp` file underwent multiple revisions between 12:21 PM and 12:26 PM on March 18, 2025.  These changes primarily involved additions of `DebugLog` statements within the `parseCertificateReport` function.  These debug logs track the execution flow, printing information about the `statusType`, `statusStr`, size of `certsArray`, and the building of `certsString`.  The core functionality of parsing different state data types (CPU utilization, disk utilization, connection status, etc.) remained consistent across all revisions.  The final revision added more detailed logging within the inner loop of `parseCertificateReport`.

The `CertificateManager.cpp` file was modified at 1:14:19 PM on March 18, 2025. This revision contains a substantial amount of code related to certificate management, including functions for starting and stopping timers (`RevocationTimer`, `CertificateReportTimer`), updating backoff and polling intervals, managing issuer endpoints, updating CA certificates and configured certificates, triggering CRL downloads, and generating certificate reports.  The `generateCertificateReportImpl` function is noteworthy, as it validates certificates against a CA certificate bundle and CRL bundle, categorizing them as valid, expiring soon, expired, or revoked.  The function then constructs a JSON report summarizing the certificate statuses. The code also includes a comment explaining the current method of gathering certificates (combining configured certificates and those ingested via a REST API).
