# Activity Summary for 3/20/2025

## 10:36:48 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/SNMPLib.py` file on March 20, 2025.  The code remains largely unchanged across all revisions.  The file contains functions for interacting with SNMP, including:

*   `create_snmp_session_to`: Creates an SNMP session (v1 or v2c).
*   `create_snmpv3_session_to`: Creates an SNMPv3 session.
*   `create_snmp_session`: Creates an SNMP session given a MIB path, address, version, community, and port.
*   `create_snmpv3_session`: Creates an SNMPv3 session with detailed authentication parameters.
*   `get_snmp_object`: Retrieves an SNMP object's value.
*   `expect_received_trap`: Checks for a specific trap in the SNMP log.
*   `_expect_received_t128_network_trap`: A helper function for checking T128 network traps.
*   `expect_received_t128_network_trap_admin_down`: Checks for a specific T128 network interface down trap.


The timestamps indicate that the file was modified several times within a short period (between 10:28:52 AM and 10:32:38 AM), suggesting minor edits or potential debugging.  The content itself shows consistent use of the `pysnmp` library for SNMP operations,  and the handling of both SNMPv2c and SNMPv3 protocols with various authentication methods (MD5, SHA, DES, AES).  There are no discernible pattern in the code changes across the different revisions other than the timestamps.


## 12:36:47 PM
The log shows modifications to two Python files: `remote_api.py` and `snmp.py`.

`remote_api.py` underwent three revisions between 11:56:04 AM and 11:57:01 AM on March 20, 2025.  The changes were minor and focused on removing `logger.debug` statements from the `connect_to_host` method.  The core functionality of connecting to remote hosts via SSH or a Linux-specific API remained unchanged.  The file manages remote connections, offering methods to connect, disconnect, and handle exceptions.

`snmp.py`, modified at 12:08:30 PM and again at 12:28:51 PM on March 20, 2025, is a class focused on managing SNMP clients. The first revision shows the initial implementation, including methods to manage MIBs, start/stop trap receivers, write configurations, and parse trap logs.  The second revision added logging statements within the `_parse_trap_log` method to help debug the parsing process, and a `logger.debug` statement displaying the number of parsed traps.  The file uses a Linux connection object and contains numerous methods for interacting with SNMP on a remote device,  indicating it's designed for managing SNMP traps and configurations.  The `_parse_trap_log` method parses SNMP trap logs, extracting key-value pairs, highlighting the system's focus on SNMP trap management.
