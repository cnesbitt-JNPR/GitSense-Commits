# Activity Summary for 3/20/2025

## 10:36:48 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/SNMPLib.py` file on March 20, 2025.  The code remains largely unchanged across all revisions.  The file contains functions for interacting with SNMP, including:

*   `create_snmp_session_to`: Creates an SNMP session (v1 or v2c).
*   `create_snmpv3_session_to`: Creates an SNMPv3 session.
*   `create_snmp_session`: Creates an SNMP session given a MIB path, address, version, community, and port.
*   `create_snmpv3_session`: Creates an SNMPv3 session with detailed authentication parameters.
*   `get_snmp_object`: Retrieves an SNMP object's value.
*   `expect_received_trap`: Checks for a specific trap in the SNMP log.
*   `_expect_received_t128_network_trap`: A helper function for checking T128 network traps.
*   `expect_received_t128_network_trap_admin_down`: Checks for a specific T128 network interface down trap.


The timestamps indicate that the file was modified several times within a short period (between 10:28:52 AM and 10:32:38 AM), suggesting minor edits or potential debugging.  The content itself shows consistent use of the `pysnmp` library for SNMP operations,  and the handling of both SNMPv2c and SNMPv3 protocols with various authentication methods (MD5, SHA, DES, AES).  There are no discernible pattern in the code changes across the different revisions other than the timestamps.
