# Activity Summary for 3/26/2025

## 8:36:48 AM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` file contains unit tests for a `SystemChangeHandler` class, likely responsible for managing system alarms.  The tests cover various scenarios, including version mismatches, CPU utilization, configuration node utilization, and application ID cache utilization.

Significant changes (all on 3/26/2025, 8:36:44 AM):  The entire file represents a single code change at this timestamp.

Key updates within the file:

* **Version Mismatch Alarms:** Tests verify alarm generation and clearing (`processStateChange`, `processAlarmOnNodeDeletion`) based on software version discrepancies between nodes.  Actions include `Add`, `Clear`, and `None`.

* **CPU Usage Alarms:**  Tests extensively cover CPU utilization alarms, incorporating debouncing mechanisms (30 iterations before alarm triggers).  The tests consider scenarios with and without isolation masks, and with one or two nodes.  Actions include `Add`, `Clear`, and `None`.

* **Configuration Node Utilization Alarms:** Tests check alarm generation and absence based on utilization levels.  Actions include `Add` and `None`.

* **Application ID Cache Utilization Alarms:** Tests validate the generation and clearing of events (`Action::Event`) related to application ID cache utilization.  Actions include `Event`, `None`, and `Clear`.

* **Default Password Alarms:**  Helper functions `getExpectedDefaultPasswordAlarm1` and `getExpectedDefaultPasswordAlarm2` suggest tests (not explicitly shown in the provided snippet) for alarms related to default passwords.

Recurring elements:

* The code heavily uses the `processStateChange` function to simulate different system state changes and checks the returned action (`Add`, `Clear`, `None`, `Event`).
*  `expectAlarmsEqual` function is used repeatedly to verify the created alarms against expected values.
* The `AlarmFactory` and `SystemChangeHandler` classes are central to the test suite.
* The tests frequently use `ASSERT_TRUE` and `EXPECT_EQ` for assertions.  There is consistent use of test fixtures (using TEST macro) and setup/teardown within each test.
* The test cases consistently use `nodeName1` and `nodeName2` suggesting a two-node system is being tested.


The tests are well-structured and comprehensive, covering edge cases and different alarm types.  The use of helper functions to create expected alarms improves readability.
