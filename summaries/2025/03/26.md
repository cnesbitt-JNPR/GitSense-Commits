# Activity Summary for 3/26/2025

## 8:36:48 AM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` file contains unit tests for a `SystemChangeHandler` class, likely responsible for managing system alarms.  The tests cover various scenarios, including version mismatches, CPU utilization, configuration node utilization, and application ID cache utilization.

Significant changes (all on 3/26/2025, 8:36:44 AM):  The entire file represents a single code change at this timestamp.

Key updates within the file:

* **Version Mismatch Alarms:** Tests verify alarm generation and clearing (`processStateChange`, `processAlarmOnNodeDeletion`) based on software version discrepancies between nodes.  Actions include `Add`, `Clear`, and `None`.

* **CPU Usage Alarms:**  Tests extensively cover CPU utilization alarms, incorporating debouncing mechanisms (30 iterations before alarm triggers).  The tests consider scenarios with and without isolation masks, and with one or two nodes.  Actions include `Add`, `Clear`, and `None`.

* **Configuration Node Utilization Alarms:** Tests check alarm generation and absence based on utilization levels.  Actions include `Add` and `None`.

* **Application ID Cache Utilization Alarms:** Tests validate the generation and clearing of events (`Action::Event`) related to application ID cache utilization.  Actions include `Event`, `None`, and `Clear`.

* **Default Password Alarms:**  Helper functions `getExpectedDefaultPasswordAlarm1` and `getExpectedDefaultPasswordAlarm2` suggest tests (not explicitly shown in the provided snippet) for alarms related to default passwords.

Recurring elements:

* The code heavily uses the `processStateChange` function to simulate different system state changes and checks the returned action (`Add`, `Clear`, `None`, `Event`).
*  `expectAlarmsEqual` function is used repeatedly to verify the created alarms against expected values.
* The `AlarmFactory` and `SystemChangeHandler` classes are central to the test suite.
* The tests frequently use `ASSERT_TRUE` and `EXPECT_EQ` for assertions.  There is consistent use of test fixtures (using TEST macro) and setup/teardown within each test.
* The test cases consistently use `nodeName1` and `nodeName2` suggesting a two-node system is being tested.


The tests are well-structured and comprehensive, covering edge cases and different alarm types.  The use of helper functions to create expected alarms improves readability.

The provided code represents unit tests for a `SystemChangeHandler` class, likely part of an alarm management system.  The tests cover various scenarios related to alarm generation and handling for different system events.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` file underwent two updates, both within a minute of each other on March 26, 2025. The content of the file remained identical in both updates, indicating a potential accidental duplicate log entry rather than actual code changes.

The tests focus on several key alarm types:

* **Version Mismatch Alarms:**  Tests cover scenarios with one and two nodes, including alarm generation, clearing, and clearing via node deletion.  The tests explicitly check for `Action::Add` and `Action::Clear` states.

* **CPU Usage Alarms:**  These tests feature a debounce mechanism (a 30-iteration loop) before triggering an alarm, simulating a threshold crossing after multiple events.  They also test scenarios with and without isolation masks.  Different aggregate values (`cpuUtilizationTooHighAggrValue` and `cpuUtilizationTooHighAggrValueNoMask`) suggest distinct calculation logic based on the presence of masks.


* **Configuration Node Utilization Alarms:**  Tests cover scenarios where utilization is below, at, and above the threshold, resulting in `Action::None` and `Action::Add` actions, respectively.

* **Application ID Cache Utilization Alarms:** The tests demonstrate `Action::Event` for threshold crossings, and `Action::Clear` when the threshold is no longer exceeded.


The tests extensively use `EXPECT_EQ` from the Google Test framework to validate the expected alarm actions and alarm object properties (category, nodeName, severity, value, message). The `expectAlarmsEqual` helper function facilitates a more detailed comparison of alarm objects.  The consistent use of `buildSystemStatePathInfo`, `getExpected...Alarm` functions, and test naming conventions (`TEST(SystemChangeHandlerTest, ...`) indicates a well-structured and organized test suite.


## 11:36:49 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of two files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/RBAC.py` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/RBAC/RBACRest.robot`.  The `RBAC.py` file contains Python code for managing users via REST API calls.  The `RBACRest.robot` file contains Robot Framework test cases for testing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) on various API endpoints.

The initial version of `RBAC.py` (10:51:18 AM) includes functions for creating, deleting, and editing users, along with a function to filter alarm responses.  A later revision (10:55:53 AM)  replaces `get_filtered_alarm_json` with `get_filtered_alarm_list_from_response`, suggesting a change in how alarm data is handledâ€”from JSON to a list.

The `RBACRest.robot` file remains largely unchanged across the revisions (10:54:50 AM, 10:54:59 AM, 10:55:30 AM, 10:56:07 AM). It consistently features Robot Framework test cases designed to verify RBAC functionality for different user roles across numerous API endpoints (/api/v1/user, /api/user-role, /api/v1/config/getJSON, and others). Each test case uses the `Make Get Request` keyword and checks the response code (e.g., 200 for success, 403 for forbidden). The test suite uses several libraries, including `RestLib`, `JSONAssert`, and custom libraries specific to the project. The consistent use of tags like `nightly_stable`, `nightly_stable_rhel`, `rbac`, `rest`, and `http` indicates a standardized testing approach and potential categorization based on stability, environment (RHEL), and API type.  The test cases are organized to cover a wide range of API functionalities, ensuring thorough RBAC testing. There are no visible changes in the content of `RBACRest.robot` across the different timestamps.
