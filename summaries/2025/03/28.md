# Activity Summary for 3/28/2025

## 4:16:19 PM
The log shows two code changes.  The first, to `Untitled-1`,  has no visible code content, making its purpose unclear.  The timestamp is 3/28/2025, 3:57:23 PM.


The second change, at 3/28/2025, 3:57:36 PM, modifies `/Users/cnesbitt/Downloads/dut1_128T-snmpd.conf`. This file appears to be a configuration file for an SNMP master agent, specifically for a 128T device. The configuration includes settings for:

*   **AgentX:** Specifies the agentX socket, permissions, and administrator credentials.
*   **OID Overrides:**  Overrides an OID for identification as a 128T Enterprise.
*   **MIB Views:** Defines several MIB views (`t128_supported_mib_view`) to control access to specific MIBs, including MIB-2, UCD-SNMP-MIB, and 128T-specific MIBs.  Access is granted to  ifTable, ifXtable, and other relevant tables.
*   **Agent Address:** Sets the agent address for both UDP and UDP6.
*   **Access Control:** Defines read-only community strings ("public") for SNMP access, with both IPv4 and IPv6 support.
*   **Notification Receiver:** Configures a notification receiver for traps, specifying an IPv6 address and port.


The file is explicitly marked as auto-generated and should not be manually edited.  The updates to this file suggest a configuration of SNMP access and monitoring for the 128T device.
