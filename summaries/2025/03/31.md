# Activity Summary for 3/31/2025

## 3:21:56 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` underwent several revisions on March 31st, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent across all revisions, focusing on testing SNMP functionality within a 128T system.  The test suite utilizes numerous libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, `T128`, `SnmpCommon`) and resources (`TestbedStore`, `AlarmCommon`, `MibDefinitions`, `SnmpCommon`, `BaseSuiteVariables`).

The test cases remained unchanged throughout the observed revisions. They cover various aspects of SNMP, including:

* **SNMP Host MIB Sanity Test:** Verifying basic SNMPv2-MIB objects (`sysObjectID`, `sysLocation`).
* **T128 System MIB Basic Objects:** Testing T128-SYSTEM-MIB scalar objects (`t128RouterName`, `t128NodeName`, `t128NodeRole`, `t128AssetId`).
* **T128 System MIB Process Table:**  Verifying entries in the T128-SYSTEM-MIB process table.
* **Snmp Get Table IfTable:** Testing IF-MIB::ifTable entries, including interface speed handling based on RFC2863 and comparing SNMP data with values from `/stats/interface/received/bytes` and `/stats/interface/sent/bytes`.
* **T128 Alarm MIB Alarm Tables:** Testing alarm table functionality, including shelving and unshelving alarms and verifying SNMP `GetNext` on alarm entries.
* **T128 Metrics MIB Metrics Table:**  Verifying entries in the T128-METRICS-MIB metrics table.
* **Receive Alarm Trap:** Testing reception of SNMP traps (with and without shelving) after an interface bounce.  A `Sleep 60s` command indicates a potential latency issue awaiting investigation (`TODO: I95-18685`).
* **Receive ifDown and ifUp Traps:** Testing reception of IF-MIB ifLinkDown and ifLinkUp traps.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/SNMPLib.py` library also saw minor updates between 3:03:16 PM and 3:04:29 PM.  These changes appear to be minor formatting adjustments within the docstrings of several functions; the core logic and functionality remained consistent. The library provides functions for creating SNMP sessions (v2c and v3), retrieving SNMP objects, and expecting specific SNMP traps.


The timestamps indicate a series of rapid modifications to the test suite within a short timeframe (approximately 30 minutes), potentially suggesting iterative debugging or minor adjustments to the tests. No substantial structural changes or significant code alterations were observed in the provided logs.

The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/tools/python3/ote_sshlib_clients/ote_sshlib_clients/snmp.py` was updated on 3/31/2025, 4:18:20 PM.  This Python file defines a `Snmp` class (although it's noted to be a mixin for a `Linux` class and shouldn't be used directly).  The class primarily manages SNMP clients, including installing MIBs (from a system-wide location or a specified path), starting and stopping a trap receiver, writing configuration files (for the trap receiver and SNMPv3 users), clearing logs, and parsing trap logs.  The code uses `execute_sudo_command` extensively to interact with the system.  Log files, configuration files, and PID files are stored in `/tmp`.  The `install_mibs_from_path` function iterates through `.mib` files.  Log parsing involves splitting lines based on `<TRAP>` tags and `=` signs. A `NotImplementedError` indicates the class is intended for inheritance and not direct instantiation.  The code also contains a commented-out section suggesting potential configuration options for trap receiver formatting.
