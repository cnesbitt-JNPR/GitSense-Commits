# Activity Summary for 3/31/2025

## 3:21:56 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` underwent several revisions on March 31st, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent across all revisions, focusing on testing SNMP functionality within a 128T system.  The test suite utilizes numerous libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, `T128`, `SnmpCommon`) and resources (`TestbedStore`, `AlarmCommon`, `MibDefinitions`, `SnmpCommon`, `BaseSuiteVariables`).

The test cases remained unchanged throughout the observed revisions. They cover various aspects of SNMP, including:

* **SNMP Host MIB Sanity Test:** Verifying basic SNMPv2-MIB objects (`sysObjectID`, `sysLocation`).
* **T128 System MIB Basic Objects:** Testing T128-SYSTEM-MIB scalar objects (`t128RouterName`, `t128NodeName`, `t128NodeRole`, `t128AssetId`).
* **T128 System MIB Process Table:**  Verifying entries in the T128-SYSTEM-MIB process table.
* **Snmp Get Table IfTable:** Testing IF-MIB::ifTable entries, including interface speed handling based on RFC2863 and comparing SNMP data with values from `/stats/interface/received/bytes` and `/stats/interface/sent/bytes`.
* **T128 Alarm MIB Alarm Tables:** Testing alarm table functionality, including shelving and unshelving alarms and verifying SNMP `GetNext` on alarm entries.
* **T128 Metrics MIB Metrics Table:**  Verifying entries in the T128-METRICS-MIB metrics table.
* **Receive Alarm Trap:** Testing reception of SNMP traps (with and without shelving) after an interface bounce.  A `Sleep 60s` command indicates a potential latency issue awaiting investigation (`TODO: I95-18685`).
* **Receive ifDown and ifUp Traps:** Testing reception of IF-MIB ifLinkDown and ifLinkUp traps.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/lib/libraries/SNMPLib.py` library also saw minor updates between 3:03:16 PM and 3:04:29 PM.  These changes appear to be minor formatting adjustments within the docstrings of several functions; the core logic and functionality remained consistent. The library provides functions for creating SNMP sessions (v2c and v3), retrieving SNMP objects, and expecting specific SNMP traps.


The timestamps indicate a series of rapid modifications to the test suite within a short timeframe (approximately 30 minutes), potentially suggesting iterative debugging or minor adjustments to the tests. No substantial structural changes or significant code alterations were observed in the provided logs.
