# Activity Summary for 4/1/2025

## 10:21:54 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/packaging/apps/128T_snmp_service/scripts/128T-snmpd.service` file between 9:33 AM and 9:56 AM on April 1st, 2025.  The file is a systemd service file for an SNMP daemon.  The majority of the file remains unchanged across all revisions; the key changes are limited to the `ExecStart` line, specifically the log file path argument (`-Lf`).

Initially (9:33 AM and 9:34 AM), the log file was set to `/tmp/snmpserver.log`. At 9:36 AM, a minor change occurred: `-Lf5d` was added before the log file path. Finally, at 9:56 AM, the log file path was changed from `/tmp/snmpserver.log` to `/var/log/128technology/snmpdservice.log`.  This suggests a migration of log files from a temporary location to a more permanent and structured location within the `/var/log` directory.  The rest of the service configuration (unit description, environment variables, pre-start commands, and reload command) remained consistent throughout.
