# Activity Summary for 4/3/2025

## 10:10:35 AM
The log shows modifications to an SNMP daemon service file and a Python SNMP client library.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/packaging/apps/128T_snmp_service/scripts/128T-snmpd.service` file was updated twice on April 3rd, 2025.  The first update (9:46:44 AM) and second update (9:51:31 AM) primarily changed the `OPTIONS` environment variable within the service file. The change involved modifying the log file verbosity level from `-Lf6d` to `-LSf7d`.  The rest of the service file configuration remained consistent, including the file paths for configuration and log files and the method for handling the `128T-snmpd-usm.conf` file.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/tools/python3/ote_sshlib_clients/ote_sshlib_clients/snmp.py` file was updated once on April 3rd, 2025 at 9:57:09 AM. This Python script defines a `Snmp` class (intended as a mixin) for managing SNMP clients, including functions to install MIBs, start/stop a trap receiver, manage configuration files, and parse trap logs.  The implementation uses `execute_sudo_command` extensively, suggesting it interacts with a remote system via SSH. The script uses `/tmp` for temporary files like the trap receiver log, configuration, and PID files.  Note that the `write_user_configuration` function appears incomplete, missing a `config` variable definition.

The log shows modifications to an SNMP daemon service configuration file and a Python script for managing SNMP clients.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/packaging/apps/128T_snmp_service/scripts/128T-snmpd.service` file was updated twice on April 3rd, 2025.  The first update (10:26:25 AM) included the option `-LSf-7d` in the `OPTIONS` environment variable. The second update (10:30:28 AM) removed the `-S` and `-7d` flags from the `OPTIONS` variable, resulting in `-Lf` instead. This change likely altered the logging behavior of the SNMP daemon.  Both versions moved the `/etc/snmp/128T-snmpd-usm.conf` file to `/var/lib/net-snmp/snmpd.conf` if it existed.  The rest of the service file definition remained consistent.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/tools/python3/ote_sshlib_clients/ote_sshlib_clients/snmp.py` file was updated once on April 3rd, 2025 at 10:58:36 AM. This Python script defines a `Snmp` class (intended as a mixin) which provides methods for managing SNMP clients, including installing MIBs, starting/stopping/managing a trap receiver, and parsing trap logs.  The script uses `sudo` commands extensively and manages configuration and log files in `/tmp/`. The `install_system_mibs` function suggests an environment where both `apt-get` and a `download-mibs` command are available.  The methods are well-documented, indicating functions for managing trap receivers, configurations, and log files.  There's a placeholder comment for a TODO item referencing TOOL-2812, indicating ongoing work or a pending resolution related to CentOS device standardization.
