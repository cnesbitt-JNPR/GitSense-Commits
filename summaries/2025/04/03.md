# Activity Summary for 4/3/2025

## 10:10:35 AM
The log shows modifications to an SNMP daemon service file and a Python SNMP client library.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/packaging/apps/128T_snmp_service/scripts/128T-snmpd.service` file was updated twice on April 3rd, 2025.  The first update (9:46:44 AM) and second update (9:51:31 AM) primarily changed the `OPTIONS` environment variable within the service file. The change involved modifying the log file verbosity level from `-Lf6d` to `-LSf7d`.  The rest of the service file configuration remained consistent, including the file paths for configuration and log files and the method for handling the `128T-snmpd-usm.conf` file.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/tools/python3/ote_sshlib_clients/ote_sshlib_clients/snmp.py` file was updated once on April 3rd, 2025 at 9:57:09 AM. This Python script defines a `Snmp` class (intended as a mixin) for managing SNMP clients, including functions to install MIBs, start/stop a trap receiver, manage configuration files, and parse trap logs.  The implementation uses `execute_sudo_command` extensively, suggesting it interacts with a remote system via SSH. The script uses `/tmp` for temporary files like the trap receiver log, configuration, and PID files.  Note that the `write_user_configuration` function appears incomplete, missing a `config` variable definition.

The log shows modifications to an SNMP daemon service configuration file and a Python script for managing SNMP clients.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/packaging/apps/128T_snmp_service/scripts/128T-snmpd.service` file was updated twice on April 3rd, 2025.  The first update (10:26:25 AM) included the option `-LSf-7d` in the `OPTIONS` environment variable. The second update (10:30:28 AM) removed the `-S` and `-7d` flags from the `OPTIONS` variable, resulting in `-Lf` instead. This change likely altered the logging behavior of the SNMP daemon.  Both versions moved the `/etc/snmp/128T-snmpd-usm.conf` file to `/var/lib/net-snmp/snmpd.conf` if it existed.  The rest of the service file definition remained consistent.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/tools/python3/ote_sshlib_clients/ote_sshlib_clients/snmp.py` file was updated once on April 3rd, 2025 at 10:58:36 AM. This Python script defines a `Snmp` class (intended as a mixin) which provides methods for managing SNMP clients, including installing MIBs, starting/stopping/managing a trap receiver, and parsing trap logs.  The script uses `sudo` commands extensively and manages configuration and log files in `/tmp/`. The `install_system_mibs` function suggests an environment where both `apt-get` and a `download-mibs` command are available.  The methods are well-documented, indicating functions for managing trap receivers, configurations, and log files.  There's a placeholder comment for a TODO item referencing TOOL-2812, indicating ongoing work or a pending resolution related to CentOS device standardization.

The log file `/Users/cnesbitt/Downloads/td1_snmptrapd.log` from 4/3/2025, 1:23:21 PM shows a series of trace statements related to SNMP configuration and registration.  The `default_store.c` file is heavily involved, with multiple calls to functions like `netsnmp_ds_set_int`, `netsnmp_ds_set_boolean`, `netsnmp_ds_toggle_boolean`, and `netsnmp_ds_set_string` to set various integer, boolean, and string configuration parameters (LIB:4, LIB:28, LIB:13, LIB:5, APP:1, APP:2, APP:6, LIB:11).  Note that these parameters' values are changed during the log.  The log also indicates interactions with `agent_handler.c` and `agent_registry.c`, concerning handler registration and MIB registration.  Specifically, there are repeated attempts to find subtrees within the agent registry (using functions like `netsnmp_subtree_find_first`, `netsnmp_subtree_find_prev`),  often resulting in "didn't find a subtree" messages followed by successful finds.  There are also several calls to callback functions within `callback.c`, including locking and unlocking mechanisms (`_callback_lock`, `_callback_unlock`)  around callback execution.  The repeated patterns of MIB and handler registrations, alongside the search and subsequent find of subtrees, suggest an initialization or reconfiguration process where the system searches for existing elements, and if not found, registers them, possibly indicating a dynamic MIB configuration. The log shows multiple instances of registering handlers and MIBs at OIDs ".0", ".1", and ".2".
