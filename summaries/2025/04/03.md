# Activity Summary for 4/3/2025

## 10:10:35 AM
The log shows modifications to an SNMP daemon service file and a Python SNMP client library.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/packaging/apps/128T_snmp_service/scripts/128T-snmpd.service` file was updated twice on April 3rd, 2025.  The first update (9:46:44 AM) and second update (9:51:31 AM) primarily changed the `OPTIONS` environment variable within the service file. The change involved modifying the log file verbosity level from `-Lf6d` to `-LSf7d`.  The rest of the service file configuration remained consistent, including the file paths for configuration and log files and the method for handling the `128T-snmpd-usm.conf` file.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/tools/python3/ote_sshlib_clients/ote_sshlib_clients/snmp.py` file was updated once on April 3rd, 2025 at 9:57:09 AM. This Python script defines a `Snmp` class (intended as a mixin) for managing SNMP clients, including functions to install MIBs, start/stop a trap receiver, manage configuration files, and parse trap logs.  The implementation uses `execute_sudo_command` extensively, suggesting it interacts with a remote system via SSH. The script uses `/tmp` for temporary files like the trap receiver log, configuration, and PID files.  Note that the `write_user_configuration` function appears incomplete, missing a `config` variable definition.

The log shows modifications to an SNMP daemon service configuration file and a Python script for managing SNMP clients.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/packaging/apps/128T_snmp_service/scripts/128T-snmpd.service` file was updated twice on April 3rd, 2025.  The first update (10:26:25 AM) included the option `-LSf-7d` in the `OPTIONS` environment variable. The second update (10:30:28 AM) removed the `-S` and `-7d` flags from the `OPTIONS` variable, resulting in `-Lf` instead. This change likely altered the logging behavior of the SNMP daemon.  Both versions moved the `/etc/snmp/128T-snmpd-usm.conf` file to `/var/lib/net-snmp/snmpd.conf` if it existed.  The rest of the service file definition remained consistent.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/tools/python3/ote_sshlib_clients/ote_sshlib_clients/snmp.py` file was updated once on April 3rd, 2025 at 10:58:36 AM. This Python script defines a `Snmp` class (intended as a mixin) which provides methods for managing SNMP clients, including installing MIBs, starting/stopping/managing a trap receiver, and parsing trap logs.  The script uses `sudo` commands extensively and manages configuration and log files in `/tmp/`. The `install_system_mibs` function suggests an environment where both `apt-get` and a `download-mibs` command are available.  The methods are well-documented, indicating functions for managing trap receivers, configurations, and log files.  There's a placeholder comment for a TODO item referencing TOOL-2812, indicating ongoing work or a pending resolution related to CentOS device standardization.


## 2:09:26 PM
The log file `/Users/cnesbitt/Downloads/td1_snmptrapd.log` from 4/3/2025, 1:23:21 PM shows a series of trace statements related to SNMP configuration and registration.  The `default_store.c` file is heavily involved, with multiple calls to functions like `netsnmp_ds_set_int`, `netsnmp_ds_set_boolean`, `netsnmp_ds_toggle_boolean`, and `netsnmp_ds_set_string` to set various integer, boolean, and string configuration parameters (LIB:4, LIB:28, LIB:13, LIB:5, APP:1, APP:2, APP:6, LIB:11).  Note that these parameters' values are changed during the log.  The log also indicates interactions with `agent_handler.c` and `agent_registry.c`, concerning handler registration and MIB registration.  Specifically, there are repeated attempts to find subtrees within the agent registry (using functions like `netsnmp_subtree_find_first`, `netsnmp_subtree_find_prev`),  often resulting in "didn't find a subtree" messages followed by successful finds.  There are also several calls to callback functions within `callback.c`, including locking and unlocking mechanisms (`_callback_lock`, `_callback_unlock`)  around callback execution.  The repeated patterns of MIB and handler registrations, alongside the search and subsequent find of subtrees, suggest an initialization or reconfiguration process where the system searches for existing elements, and if not found, registers them, possibly indicating a dynamic MIB configuration. The log shows multiple instances of registering handlers and MIBs at OIDs ".0", ".1", and ".2".


## 2:10:36 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/SNMP/SnmpSuite.robot` (updated 4/3/2025, 2:09:33 PM) contains numerous tests for verifying SNMP functionality on a 128T device.  It uses several libraries including `SNMPLib`, `CliLib`, `SSHLib`, and custom libraries for handling alarms, CLI interactions, and Linux devices.  The suite relies on resources defining testbed configurations (`TestbedStore.robot`, `BaseSuiteVariables.robot`), MIB definitions (`MibDefinitions.robot`), and common SNMP functions (`SnmpCommon.robot`).

The `SnmpCommon.robot` file (updated 4/3/2025, 2:09:22 PM) defines keywords for configuring SNMPv2c and SNMPv3 on the target device.  These keywords build SNMP configuration lists programmatically, setting parameters like community strings, user credentials (for SNMPv3), engine IDs, and trap receiver information.  The keywords handle both SNMP versions, indicating a comprehensive approach to testing different SNMP configurations.  Both versions utilize the `Configure T128 On` keyword suggesting a common setup procedure for the target device.


The `SnmpSuite.robot` test suite includes tests covering various aspects of SNMP:

* **Host MIB Sanity Test:**  Verifies basic SNMP object retrieval using `Get Snmp Object` keyword, focusing on `SNMPv2-MIB` objects.
* **T128 System MIB Tests:**  Tests retrieving scalar and table objects from the `T128-SYSTEM-MIB`, including router name, node name, and process information using `Get Snmp Object` and `Snmp Get Table` keywords.
* **IF-MIB Tests:**  Checks retrieval of `IF-MIB::ifTable` entries and verifies interface statistics against expected values retrieved via other methods.
* **T128 Alarm MIB Tests:**  Tests interaction with `T128-ALARM-MIB`, verifying alarm table entries before and after shelving alarms and using a `Get Next Snmp Object` method.  These tests include manipulating maintenance mode and triggering interface alarms.
* **T128 Metrics MIB Tests:**  Verifies retrieval of data from `T128-METRICS-MIB::t128MetricsTable`
* **Trap Reception Tests:**  Tests reception of SNMP traps triggered by interface status changes ("ifDown" and "ifUp"), including those that are or aren't shelved.


The tests consistently use the `Should Be Equal` and `Should Be Within` assertions to validate the retrieved SNMP data against expected values, making them robust and comprehensive.  The overall structure suggests a thorough testing strategy designed for the stability and reliability of SNMP features on the 128T platform.


## 3:41:14 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ProcessManager/SnmpdConfigGenerator.cpp` between 3:10 PM and 3:21 PM on April 3, 2025.  The changes primarily involve refinements to the `generateOneSnmpV2cNotificationConfig` and `generateOneSnmpV3NotificationConfig` functions within the `SnmpdConfigGenerator` class.

Specifically, the updates focus on handling IPv6 addresses within the SNMP notification configuration generation. Earlier versions lacked proper handling of IPv6 addresses in the `generateOneSnmpNotificationConfigPreamble` and `generateOneSnmpV2cNotificationConfig` functions.  The final version (3:21:56 PM) correctly includes brackets `[]` around IPv6 addresses and adds `udp6:` prefix when generating `destinationTuple` string in  `generateOneSnmpV2cNotificationConfig` function and consistently formats IPv6 addresses within `generateOneSnmpNotificationConfigPreamble` function.

The `SNMPLib.py` file shows the creation of SNMP sessions (v2c and v3) and functions for retrieving SNMP objects and expecting traps. This file was modified only once at 2:56 PM on April 3, 2025, and it does not appear to be related to the subsequent changes in the C++ file.  The Python code focuses on SNMP interaction, while the C++ code generates SNMPd configuration files.  There are no apparent recurring patterns or shared elements between the Python and C++ code beyond the common theme of SNMP management.
