# Activity Summary for 4/3/2025

## 10:10:35 AM
The log shows modifications to an SNMP daemon service file and a Python SNMP client library.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/packaging/apps/128T_snmp_service/scripts/128T-snmpd.service` file was updated twice on April 3rd, 2025.  The first update (9:46:44 AM) and second update (9:51:31 AM) primarily changed the `OPTIONS` environment variable within the service file. The change involved modifying the log file verbosity level from `-Lf6d` to `-LSf7d`.  The rest of the service file configuration remained consistent, including the file paths for configuration and log files and the method for handling the `128T-snmpd-usm.conf` file.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/tools/python3/ote_sshlib_clients/ote_sshlib_clients/snmp.py` file was updated once on April 3rd, 2025 at 9:57:09 AM. This Python script defines a `Snmp` class (intended as a mixin) for managing SNMP clients, including functions to install MIBs, start/stop a trap receiver, manage configuration files, and parse trap logs.  The implementation uses `execute_sudo_command` extensively, suggesting it interacts with a remote system via SSH. The script uses `/tmp` for temporary files like the trap receiver log, configuration, and PID files.  Note that the `write_user_configuration` function appears incomplete, missing a `config` variable definition.
