# Activity Summary for 4/4/2025

## 12:11:19 PM
The provided log shows three consecutive commits to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ProcessManager/SnmpdConfigGenerator.cpp` at 11:36:00 AM, 11:36:11 AM, and 11:36:24 AM on April 4th, 2025.  The changes across all three commits appear to be minor and incremental, with no substantial functional alterations to the `SnmpdConfigGenerator` class.  The code generates SNMP configuration files (`.conf`), handling both SNMP versions 2c and 3.  Each commit seems to represent a small refactoring or bug fix rather than a large-scale feature addition or redesign. There are no significant differences in functionality observable between the three versions of the file.  The code extensively uses helper functions to generate different parts of the configuration file, such as `generateEngineIdConfig`, `generateViewsConfig`, `generatePortConfig`, `generateAccessControlConfig`, and `generateNotificationReceiverConfig`.  The functions are consistently well-structured, utilizing consistent naming conventions and a common approach for building the configuration string line by line using the `makeLine` helper function.

The log shows iterative development of unit tests for an SNMP configuration generator.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ProcessManager/test/SnmpdConfigGeneratorTestLiterals.hpp` file, containing test literals and expected output strings, underwent several revisions.  These revisions primarily involved adjustments to the `expectedV2cIPv6ConfigFile` and `expectedIPv6V3ConfigFile` strings, refining the IPv6 address handling within the generated SNMP configuration files.  The most significant changes in this file occurred between 4/4/2025, 2:46:51 PM and 4/4/2025, 3:20:00 PM, where IPv6 notification receiver configurations were updated to explicitly include the protocol (`udp6:`).

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ProcessManager/test/SnmpdConfigGeneratorTest.cpp` file, containing the unit tests themselves, was also modified multiple times.  Changes here focused on adding a boolean parameter `ipv6` to the `setSnmpV2cConfig` and `setSnmpV3Config` functions to handle IPv6 configurations, and updating the test cases (`v2cConfigGenerationIPv6` and `v3ConfigGenerationIPv6`) to utilize these parameters and corresponding updated expected output strings from `SnmpdConfigGeneratorTestLiterals.hpp`.  The most significant change in this file occurred between 4/4/2025, 2:48:58 PM and 4/4/2025, 3:09:56 PM, where  `v2cConfigGenerationIPv6` was correctly updated to compare against the IPv6 specific config file.  Further updates also happened between 4/4/2025, 3:09:56 PM and 4/4/2025, 3:17:53 PM where a duplicated test case `TEST_F(SnmpdConfigGeneratorTest, v3ConfigGeneration)` was added,  and finally a change occurred between 4/4/2025 3:17:53 PM and 4/4/2025, 3:22:49 PM where the test `v3ConfigGenerationIPv6` was corrected.

Throughout the modifications, the core functionality of the test suite remained consistent: testing the generation of SNMP configuration files (V2c, V3, and user configuration files for V3) under different scenarios, including disabled, V2c, and V3 configurations and with an IPv6 addition.  The use of the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON manipulation is a recurring element, indicating a reliance on JSON for configuration data.  The tests leverage Google Test (`gtest`) for assertion and test organization.


## 5:27:05 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/PIM/PimMsdpAlarms.robot` (last updated 4/4/2025, 4:48:54 PM) verifies MSDP and BGP alarm functionality.  It uses several libraries (`SpirentUtils.py`, `T128.py`, `AlarmHandlerLib.py`, `ShowPimCommands.py`, `ShowMsdpCommands.py`) and resources (`BaseSuiteVariables.robot`, `PimCommon.robot`, `ShowMsdpExpected.robot`) defining testbed setup and teardown, including configuration and cleanup of DUTs (devices under test).

The suite contains three main test cases:

1. **Verify Peers drop from Established State Alarms:** This tests the alarm behavior when MSDP peers drop out of and re-establish the "Established" state.  It involves manipulating peer configurations on DUT2, DUT4, and DUT5 and verifying expected alarm states.

2. **Verify Peers unable to reach Established State Alarms:** This tests alarm behavior when peers fail to reach the "Established" state due to invalid configurations.  It involves configuring invalid peers on DUT2 and verifying alarms on DUT4 and DUT5.

3. **Verify Bgp and Msdp Alarms:** This test verifies that both BGP and MSDP alarms function correctly by configuring invalid peers for both protocols and checking for the corresponding alarms.


The code extensively uses keywords for testbed setup/teardown, peer configuration (including functions like `Configure DUT4 Peer On DUT2`, `Delete Peer Config On DUT2`, `Configure Invalid Peers For DUT2`, `Delete Invalid Peers On DUT2`), and alarm verification (`Verify MSDP Alarm On`, `Verify No Alarms On`).  The tests utilize variables like `${DUT2}`, `${DUT4}`, `${DUT5}` representing DUTs, and `${DUT2_ROUTER_ID}`, `${DUT2_INVALID_NEIGHBOR}` for specific router IDs and neighbors.  The `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` keyword is used multiple times, suggesting potential asynchronous operations.  The test utilizes REST connections to check the status of MSDP peers.  The `reliably configure T128` suggests the utilization of a T128 testing device or framework.
