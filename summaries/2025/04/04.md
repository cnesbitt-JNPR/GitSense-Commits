# Activity Summary for 4/4/2025

## 12:11:19 PM
The provided log shows three consecutive commits to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ProcessManager/SnmpdConfigGenerator.cpp` at 11:36:00 AM, 11:36:11 AM, and 11:36:24 AM on April 4th, 2025.  The changes across all three commits appear to be minor and incremental, with no substantial functional alterations to the `SnmpdConfigGenerator` class.  The code generates SNMP configuration files (`.conf`), handling both SNMP versions 2c and 3.  Each commit seems to represent a small refactoring or bug fix rather than a large-scale feature addition or redesign. There are no significant differences in functionality observable between the three versions of the file.  The code extensively uses helper functions to generate different parts of the configuration file, such as `generateEngineIdConfig`, `generateViewsConfig`, `generatePortConfig`, `generateAccessControlConfig`, and `generateNotificationReceiverConfig`.  The functions are consistently well-structured, utilizing consistent naming conventions and a common approach for building the configuration string line by line using the `makeLine` helper function.

The log shows iterative development of unit tests for an SNMP configuration generator.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ProcessManager/test/SnmpdConfigGeneratorTestLiterals.hpp` file, containing test literals and expected output strings, underwent several revisions.  These revisions primarily involved adjustments to the `expectedV2cIPv6ConfigFile` and `expectedIPv6V3ConfigFile` strings, refining the IPv6 address handling within the generated SNMP configuration files.  The most significant changes in this file occurred between 4/4/2025, 2:46:51 PM and 4/4/2025, 3:20:00 PM, where IPv6 notification receiver configurations were updated to explicitly include the protocol (`udp6:`).

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ProcessManager/test/SnmpdConfigGeneratorTest.cpp` file, containing the unit tests themselves, was also modified multiple times.  Changes here focused on adding a boolean parameter `ipv6` to the `setSnmpV2cConfig` and `setSnmpV3Config` functions to handle IPv6 configurations, and updating the test cases (`v2cConfigGenerationIPv6` and `v3ConfigGenerationIPv6`) to utilize these parameters and corresponding updated expected output strings from `SnmpdConfigGeneratorTestLiterals.hpp`.  The most significant change in this file occurred between 4/4/2025, 2:48:58 PM and 4/4/2025, 3:09:56 PM, where  `v2cConfigGenerationIPv6` was correctly updated to compare against the IPv6 specific config file.  Further updates also happened between 4/4/2025, 3:09:56 PM and 4/4/2025, 3:17:53 PM where a duplicated test case `TEST_F(SnmpdConfigGeneratorTest, v3ConfigGeneration)` was added,  and finally a change occurred between 4/4/2025 3:17:53 PM and 4/4/2025, 3:22:49 PM where the test `v3ConfigGenerationIPv6` was corrected.

Throughout the modifications, the core functionality of the test suite remained consistent: testing the generation of SNMP configuration files (V2c, V3, and user configuration files for V3) under different scenarios, including disabled, V2c, and V3 configurations and with an IPv6 addition.  The use of the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON manipulation is a recurring element, indicating a reliance on JSON for configuration data.  The tests leverage Google Test (`gtest`) for assertion and test organization.
