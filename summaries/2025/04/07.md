# Activity Summary for 4/7/2025

## 9:21:39 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `PimMsdpAlarms.robot` (last modified 4/7/2025, 8:25:31 AM) focuses on verifying MSDP (Multiprotocol Label Switching Data Plane) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) alarm functionality.  It uses several libraries (`SpirentUtils.py`, `T128.py`, `AlarmHandlerLib.py`, `ShowPimCommands.py`, `ShowMsdpCommands.py`) and resources (`AlarmCommon.robot`, `BaseSuiteVariables.robot`, `PimCommon.robot`, `ShowMsdpExpected.robot`).

The suite defines three main test cases:

1. **Verify Peers drop from Established State Alarms:** This test verifies MSDP alarms are triggered when peers drop from the established state, then checks if alarms clear when the connection is restored.  It involves manipulating peer configurations on DUT2, DUT4, and DUT5.

2. **Verify Peers unable to reach Established State Alarms:** This test verifies alarms when peers fail to reach the established state due to invalid configurations on DUT2, again monitoring DUT4 and DUT5 for alarm triggers.

3. **Verify Bgp and Msdp Alarms:** This test case checks the functionality of both BGP and MSDP alarms simultaneously by introducing invalid peer configurations and verifying expected alarm behaviors.

The code extensively uses keywords for testbed setup/teardown, configuration manipulation (using T128 and REST connections), and alarm verification.  The keywords manage DUTs (Devices Under Test), primarily DUT2, DUT4, and DUT5, and leverage variables for router IDs, configurations, and expected alarm states.  Significant use of lists and dictionaries is observed for organizing DUT information and alarm expectations.  A recurring pattern is the `Verify No Alarms On` keyword used before and after configuration changes to ensure expected alarm states. The tests utilize a timeout (`Wait Until Keyword Succeeds 1m 15s`) to allow sufficient time for alarm generation.
