## 4:34:10 PM
The log shows a single entry at 4/8/2025, 4:00:42 PM, updating the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file. This file contains a list of known SSH host keys for various IP addresses and hostnames, including `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` and several IP addresses in the `10.27.*.*` range.  Multiple key types are present (ssh-ed25519, ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256) for some hosts, indicating multiple authentication methods are supported. Some entries specify port numbers (e.g., `[10.27.15.13]:12811`), suggesting non-standard SSH port usage.  The update likely reflects new or updated host keys added to the known hosts file for security.  The large number of entries suggests a potentially extensive network or system configuration.
