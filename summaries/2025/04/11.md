# Activity Summary for 4/11/2025

## 11:08:04 AM
The code represents a C++ class hierarchy for managing alarm shelving, likely part of a larger configuration system.  The `AlarmShelving` class is the main container, holding a set of `Shelf` objects. Each `Shelf` object further contains a set of `AppliesTo` objects, specifying criteria for alarm shelving.

The `AppliesTo` class defines criteria using enums (like `Type` specifying "authority", "router", etc.) and lists (like `RouterNameList`, `GroupNameList`, `ResourceGroupList`).  It provides methods to add, remove, and manage these elements.

The `Shelf` class defines alarm shelving rules, including fields like `name`, `resource`, `category`, `severity`, and regular expressions for matching router and node names.  It uses enums for `MatchType`, `Category`, and `Severity`.

The code is heavily annotated, indicating it's auto-generated from an XML file (`consolidatedT128Model.xml`) using a Python script (`generateConfigCppCode.py`).  The timestamp shows the file was generated or last modified on April 11th, 2025, at 10:19:12 AM.  The `dolly` namespace suggests the use of a library providing functionality related to data structures and possibly dynamic object handling.  The code extensively uses `stl::vector_set` for efficient management of sets of elements.  The `IsRelocatable` specializations in the `dolly` namespace suggest that these classes are designed to be moved in memory efficiently.

The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmShelving.robot` underwent several revisions on April 11th, 2025, between 1:33 PM and 1:40 PM.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions:  testing the shelving and unshelving of alarms on an HA router based on various criteria (router name, node name, regex patterns, category, severity, and message).

The primary changes between revisions involve the `Setup Alarm Shelving Suite` keyword.  Specifically, the method for setting the log level within the CLI connection was modified.  The initial version used a single `Create Logged In Cli Connection` call, while subsequent updates added a  `Run Cli Command On` to configure log levels on both `DUT1` and `DUT2`. This was added in the second revision at approximately 1:39:50 PM and remains consistent in later revisions.

Each test case follows a pattern: setting variables, creating dictionaries for alarm shelf parameters, adding an alarm shelf, verifying the alarm is shelved, deleting the shelf, and finally, verifying the alarm is unshelved.  The test cases cover different ways to specify the alarms to shelf using various criteria (exact name, regex, category, severity, message, match type).

One test case (`Verify Resource Shelf`) remains commented out, likely indicating a pending fix for issue I95-56849.  The rest of the file's content remains largely unchanged across revisions, indicating a focus on refining the setup process and not altering the core test logic.
