# Activity Summary for 4/14/2025

## 4:08:05 PM
The log shows a single code update to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` at 4/14/2025, 3:52:43 PM.  This update involves significant modifications to the `SystemChangeHandler` class, which appears to be responsible for monitoring system resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk space), network connectivity, NTP server status, and configuration application state.

The code extensively uses the `dolly` library for JSON parsing and manipulation.  It defines various handler functions (`handleMemoryUsageChange`, `handleCpuUsageChange`, `handleDiskSpaceUsageChange`, etc.) that respond to changes in system state.  These handlers create, modify, or clear alarms based on predefined thresholds and conditions.  For example, memory usage above a threshold triggers a critical alarm, while CPU usage triggers a major alarm.  The code also includes logic for handling core isolation and dedication, NTP server availability, and configuration application status changes.  It uses bitmasks to represent core isolation and dedication states.  The `lookupCpuData` function manages CPU data for different nodes.  Alarms are created using an `AlarmFactory` and have severity levels (Critical, Major).  The code uses a state pattern where different states trigger different actions (Add, Clear, Modify).  The `StatePathInfo` struct seems to be central to conveying information about the source and nature of the state changes.

The code represents a `SystemChangeHandler` class responsible for monitoring and reacting to various system state changes.  The primary function is `processStateChange`, which routes events to specific handlers based on the `statePathInfo`.

On April 14, 2025, at 4:17:53 PM,  the `SystemChangeHandler.cpp` file was updated.  This update involved significant additions and modifications to the system's alarm handling logic.  Key changes include:

* **Extensive use of the `dolly` library:**  The code heavily relies on `dolly` for JSON parsing (`dolly::parseJson`), string formatting (`dolly::sformat`), and type conversions (`dolly::to`).

* **Alarm handling for multiple system metrics:** The class registers handlers for various system events, including memory usage, disk space usage, CPU utilization, NTP server status, connection status,  and configuration application state. Each handler assesses the severity of the change and generates an appropriate alarm (if necessary) using the `AlarmFactory`.

* **Threshold-based alarm generation:**  Alarms are triggered when specific thresholds (e.g., `memoryUsageThreshold`, `cpuUsageTriggerThreshold`, `diskSpaceUsageTriggerThreshold`) are exceeded.  Clear actions are also implemented when conditions return to normal (e.g., when memory usage drops below the clear threshold).

* **CPU utilization handling:** The `handleCpuUsageChange` function exhibits more complex logic, considering core isolation and dedication masks to calculate aggregate CPU utilization before triggering alarms.  It uses a `CpuAlarmCheck` class for debouncing and threshold management.

* **NTP Server error handling:** The `handleNtpServersChange` function specifically checks for active NTP servers and generates alarms if no active server is found.


* **Configuration Application State Handling:** This section parses the configuration application state JSON, determining whether a restart is required and raising alarms accordingly. The alarm action is dependent on whether the alarm already exists.

* **Entitlement Status Handling:** The `handleEntitlementStatusChange` function is partially shown, suggesting separate handling for new and existing entitlement status alarms.


The code demonstrates a robust system for monitoring and alerting based on changes in several system parameters.  The use of JSON for representing state information and the structured approach to alarm handling are notable aspects of the design. The reliance on the `dolly` library suggests a project with a specific dependency on this library for data handling and manipulation.
