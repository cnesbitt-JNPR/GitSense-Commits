# Activity Summary for 4/14/2025

## 4:08:05 PM
The log shows a single code update to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` at 4/14/2025, 3:52:43 PM.  This update involves significant modifications to the `SystemChangeHandler` class, which appears to be responsible for monitoring system resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk space), network connectivity, NTP server status, and configuration application state.

The code extensively uses the `dolly` library for JSON parsing and manipulation.  It defines various handler functions (`handleMemoryUsageChange`, `handleCpuUsageChange`, `handleDiskSpaceUsageChange`, etc.) that respond to changes in system state.  These handlers create, modify, or clear alarms based on predefined thresholds and conditions.  For example, memory usage above a threshold triggers a critical alarm, while CPU usage triggers a major alarm.  The code also includes logic for handling core isolation and dedication, NTP server availability, and configuration application status changes.  It uses bitmasks to represent core isolation and dedication states.  The `lookupCpuData` function manages CPU data for different nodes.  Alarms are created using an `AlarmFactory` and have severity levels (Critical, Major).  The code uses a state pattern where different states trigger different actions (Add, Clear, Modify).  The `StatePathInfo` struct seems to be central to conveying information about the source and nature of the state changes.
