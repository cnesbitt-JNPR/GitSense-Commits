# Activity Summary for 4/15/2025

## 9:08:07 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/` directory, primarily focusing on the `SystemChangeHandler.cpp` and `SystemChangeHandler.hpp` files.  The changes span from 8:25 AM to 8:48 AM on April 15, 2025.

`SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` (8:25:11 AM): This file contains unit tests for the `SystemChangeHandler` class.  The tests cover various scenarios for alarm generation and clearing, including: version mismatches, CPU usage, configuration node utilization, application ID cache utilization, and default password violations.  Multiple test cases exist for each scenario, often checking for one and two nodes.  A significant portion of the code deals with creating expected alarm objects for comparison in the tests.

`SystemChangeHandler.cpp` (Multiple Revisions): This file underwent several revisions between 8:33 AM and 8:48 AM.  The core functionality is the handling of system state changes and the subsequent generation or clearing of alarms.  Each revision appears to be incremental, adding or refining alarm handling functions for various system parameters (memory utilization, disk space, CPU usage, network connections, application configuration, NTP server status, SNMP agent state, configuration node utilization, software version, and default passwords).  The code extensively uses the `dolly` library for JSON parsing and manipulation.  A recurring pattern is the use of `handle...Change` functions to process state changes and `new...Alarm` functions to create alarm objects.  The CPU usage alarm handling demonstrates a debounce mechanism to prevent spurious alarms.

`SystemChangeHandler.hpp` (8:34:24 AM): This header file declares the `SystemChangeHandler` class and its member functions. It defines thresholds for CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space usage, which are currently hardcoded.  The class uses several helper classes and functions for alarm creation, JSON parsing, core mask manipulation, and NTP server status check.  The header also shows the inclusion of other header files related to alarm management and system states.  The use of EnumFactory suggests a structured approach to managing enums.

The repeated revisions of `SystemChangeHandler.cpp` suggest iterative development and debugging of the alarm handling logic. The consistent use of `dolly` library and similar structure across functions suggests code maintainability and consistency were a focus in development.


## 10:08:07 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` files between 9:29 AM and 10:02 AM on April 15, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`  primarily underwent changes at 9:29 AM and 9:34 AM. These changes involve additions and modifications to multiple unit tests within the `SystemChangeHandlerTest` class. The tests cover various scenarios for alarm handling, including version mismatches, CPU usage, configuration node utilization, application ID cache utilization, and default password violations.  There's a recurring pattern of using `processStateChange` to simulate state changes and verifying the resulting alarm actions (`Action::None`, `Action::Add`, `Action::Clear`).  The tests extensively use helper functions like `getExpectedCpuAlarm`, `getExpectedConfigNodeAlarm`, and `expectAlarmsEqual` to simplify setup and assertion.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp`  shows edits at 9:34 AM, 9:41 AM, 9:42 AM, and 9:44 AM.  These revisions focus on the implementation of the `SystemChangeHandler` class. The code handles various system events related to memory, disk space, connections, CPU usage, core isolation/dedication masks, NTP servers, configuration application state, entitlement status, DNS, SNMP, and software version.  Each event triggers a specific handler function, which uses the `AlarmFactory` to generate and manage alarms.  There's significant use of the `dolly::parseJson` and `dolly::to` functions for JSON parsing and type conversion, respectively. The changes across multiple revisions suggest iterative development and debugging, potentially addressing issues or adding new features to the alarm handling system. The final revision at 10:02 AM does not show any significant change in the code compared to previous ones.
