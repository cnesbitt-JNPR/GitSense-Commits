# Activity Summary for 4/16/2025

## 9:08:05 AM
The log shows two entries for `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp`, both on 4/16/2025, with a 12-second difference in timestamps.  The code itself is identical in both entries.  The file contains a `SystemChangeHandler` class responsible for handling various system state changes and generating alarms.  It registers functions to handle changes related to memory, disk space, CPU utilization, connections status, core masks (isolated and dedicated), NTP servers, configuration application state, entitlement status, config sync info, DNS info, SNMP agent state, config node utilization, software version, AppID cache utilization, and default password violations.  The code extensively uses the `dolly` library for JSON parsing and manipulation and incorporates alarm severity levels (Critical and Major).  Each handler function typically checks for thresholds or specific conditions to determine whether to add, clear, or modify an alarm.  The handling of CPU utilization is noteworthy, as it aggregates utilization across cores, excluding isolated or dedicated cores, before triggering an alarm.  There's also sophisticated handling of NTP server errors and configuration application state changes, including distinguishing between initial and subsequent alarms.  The code suggests a system monitoring and alerting mechanism with detailed state tracking and sophisticated alarm management.
