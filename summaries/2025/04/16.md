# Activity Summary for 4/16/2025

## 9:08:05 AM
The log shows two entries for `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp`, both on 4/16/2025, with a 12-second difference in timestamps.  The code itself is identical in both entries.  The file contains a `SystemChangeHandler` class responsible for handling various system state changes and generating alarms.  It registers functions to handle changes related to memory, disk space, CPU utilization, connections status, core masks (isolated and dedicated), NTP servers, configuration application state, entitlement status, config sync info, DNS info, SNMP agent state, config node utilization, software version, AppID cache utilization, and default password violations.  The code extensively uses the `dolly` library for JSON parsing and manipulation and incorporates alarm severity levels (Critical and Major).  Each handler function typically checks for thresholds or specific conditions to determine whether to add, clear, or modify an alarm.  The handling of CPU utilization is noteworthy, as it aggregates utilization across cores, excluding isolated or dedicated cores, before triggering an alarm.  There's also sophisticated handling of NTP server errors and configuration application state changes, including distinguishing between initial and subsequent alarms.  The code suggests a system monitoring and alerting mechanism with detailed state tracking and sophisticated alarm management.


## 11:08:07 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` on April 16, 2025.  The file is a C++ class responsible for handling system state changes and generating corresponding alarms.  No functional changes are observed across the revisions; the code remains identical in each version.  The timestamps indicate several commits within a short time frame (between 10:41 AM and 11:03 AM), possibly reflecting iterative development, debugging, or minor adjustments during the commit process rather than substantial code modifications.  The code extensively uses the `dolly` library for JSON parsing and manipulation, and the `state` namespace for system state information.  The `SystemChangeHandler` class registers multiple state change functions to handle various system events, including memory, disk space, CPU utilization, core isolation/dedication, NTP server status, and application configuration.  Each handler function processes state information, often using JSON parsing, and triggers the creation, modification, or clearing of alarms based on predefined thresholds and conditions.
