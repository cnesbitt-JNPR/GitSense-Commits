# Activity Summary for 4/17/2025

## 12:22:25 PM
The log shows two significant code changes.  The first, at 11:27:03 AM on 4/17/2025, updated the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file. This file contains SSH configuration for various hosts (all with the prefix "cnesbitt_dvm"), each specifying a hostname (`10.27.15.13`), user (`cnesbitt`), identity file (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`), and a unique port number.  The different port numbers suggest connections to various environments or services on the same host.


The second change, at 12:11:36 PM on 4/17/2025, modified the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file. This file lists known host keys for various IP addresses, including `10.27.15.13` (with multiple port entries), and other IP addresses in the `10.27.xx.xx` range. Multiple key types (ssh-ed25519, ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256) are present for many of these hosts. The presence of multiple keys for the same host and port suggests key rotation or the use of multiple authentication methods.  The significant time difference between the two updates suggests that the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file was likely updated *before* the connections were established and the keys added to the  `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file.
