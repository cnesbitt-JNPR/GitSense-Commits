# Activity Summary for 4/17/2025

## 12:22:25 PM
The log shows two significant code changes.  The first, at 11:27:03 AM on 4/17/2025, updated the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file. This file contains SSH configuration for various hosts (all with the prefix "cnesbitt_dvm"), each specifying a hostname (`10.27.15.13`), user (`cnesbitt`), identity file (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`), and a unique port number.  The different port numbers suggest connections to various environments or services on the same host.


The second change, at 12:11:36 PM on 4/17/2025, modified the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file. This file lists known host keys for various IP addresses, including `10.27.15.13` (with multiple port entries), and other IP addresses in the `10.27.xx.xx` range. Multiple key types (ssh-ed25519, ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256) are present for many of these hosts. The presence of multiple keys for the same host and port suggests key rotation or the use of multiple authentication methods.  The significant time difference between the two updates suggests that the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file was likely updated *before* the connections were established and the keys added to the  `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file.


## 2:22:25 PM
The log shows two significant code changes within a minute of each other on April 17, 2025.

The first change, at 2:17:46 PM, updates the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file. This file contains SSH host keys for multiple IP addresses (10.27.15.13, 10.27.36.239, 10.27.40.88) and a hostname (launchpad.ssn.juniper.net).  The entries include various key types (ssh-ed25519, ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256), with several entries for the IP address `10.27.15.13` indicating multiple ports (12801, 12804, 12806, 12807, 12809, 12811) are used.


The second change, at 2:17:57 PM, modifies the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file.  This file configures SSH connections, defining aliases (`cnesbitt_dvm`, `cnesbitt_dvm_feature`, etc.) for connecting to different ports on the IP address `10.27.15.13`.  Each alias uses the same user (`cnesbitt`) and identity file (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`), only varying in the port number. The port numbers used in the `config` file largely correspond to the ports listed in the `known_hosts` file.  This suggests a setup for accessing multiple environments or services on the same server (`10.27.15.13`).
