# Activity Summary for 4/29/2025

## 4:27:18 PM
The log shows a single entry at 4/29/2025, 4:21:54 PM, updating the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file.  This file contains public keys for various hosts, predominantly using IP addresses in the 10.27.*.* range. Multiple key types are present: `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`. Several entries correspond to the same IP address but different ports (e.g., 10.27.15.13 on ports 12801, 12804, 12805, 12806, 12807, and 12811).  This suggests multiple services running on those IP addresses.  The `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` hostname is also present with all three key types.
