# Activity Summary for 4/30/2025

## 2:22:59 PM
The log shows a single entry at 4/30/2025, 1:23:42 PM, modifying the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file.  This file contains SSH host keys for various IP addresses and hostnames.  Multiple key types are present (ssh-ed25519, ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256) for the same hosts, indicating a comprehensive record of all known keys.  The most frequent entries are for IP addresses in the 10.27.15.13 subnet.  Some entries include port numbers (e.g., `[10.27.15.13]:12811`), specifying non-standard SSH ports.  The update likely reflects adding or updating SSH host keys for various servers.


## 5:36:33 PM
The log shows a single entry at 4/30/2025, 4:44:05 PM, updating the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file.  This file contains a list of known SSH host keys for various IP addresses and hostnames.  The update includes multiple entries for several IP addresses (10.27.15.13, 10.27.36.239, 10.27.40.88, 10.27.35.50, 10.27.36.198, 10.27.33.172, 10.27.35.34, 10.27.35.129, 10.27.35.27) and one hostname (launchpad.ssn.juniper.net). Each IP address or hostname has multiple key entries, using algorithms ed25519, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, and ssh-rsa.  Some IP addresses also include entries for specific ports (e.g., `[10.27.15.13]:12811`).  The recurring pattern is the addition or update of SSH host keys for different servers.
