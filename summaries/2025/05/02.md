# Activity Summary for 5/2/2025

## 12:30:17 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `SnmpSuite.robot` (last updated 5/2/2025, 11:53:08 AM) focuses on testing SNMP functionality within a 128T system.  It uses numerous libraries (`InitRobot`, `AlarmHandlerLib`, `CliLib`, `CommonLib`, `LinuxDevices`, `LinuxLib`, `Timeseries`, `SNMPLib`, `SSHLib`, `T128`) and resources (`TestbedStore`, `AlarmCommon`, `MibDefinitions`, `SnmpCommon`, `BaseSuiteVariables`) to achieve this.

The suite includes tests for various aspects of SNMP:

* **Host MIB Sanity Test:** Verifies basic SNMP object retrieval from the SNMPv2-MIB.
* **T128 System MIB Basic Objects:** Checks specific scalar objects from the T128-SYSTEM-MIB.
* **T128 System MIB Process Table:**  Tests retrieval and verification of data from the T128-SYSTEM-MIB Process table.
* **Snmp Get Table IfTable:**  Retrieves and validates data from the IF-MIB::ifTable, including interface speed, MAC address, and various counters (octets, packets).  It handles different interface speeds gracefully.
* **T128 Alarm MIB Alarm Tables:** Tests alarm table functionality, including triggering alarms, shelving, and verifying SNMP object retrieval from both alarm and shelved alarm tables.  It involves setting up and tearing down maintenance mode and manipulating interface status.
* **T128 Metrics MIB Metrics Table:** Checks the T128-METRICS-MIB Metrics table.
* **Receive Alarm Trap:** Tests the reception of SNMP traps when an interface is bounced, both with and without shelving. This test includes a 60-second sleep, noted as temporary.
* **Receive ifDown and ifUp Traps:** Tests the reception of ifDown and ifUp traps using `ifdown` and `ifup` commands.


The tests extensively utilize keywords like `Get Snmp Object`, `Snmp Get Table`, and others specific to SNMP interaction and system control.  The `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` tags suggest a regular nightly testing schedule across different systems (likely RHEL).  The use of variables like `${DUT1_SNMP}`, `${TEST_IF}`, and others implies a parameterized approach to testing across different devices and interfaces. The suite setup involves creating various sessions (config, CLI, SSH) and configuring SNMP settings, including trap receivers.
