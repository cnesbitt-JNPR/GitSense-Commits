# Activity Summary for 5/6/2025

## 9:47:32 AM
The log shows updates to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file on 5/6/2025 at 9:21:26 AM.  The file contains SSH host keys for various IP addresses and hostnames.  The majority of entries are for IP addresses in the `10.27.*.*` range, with several entries for the same IP address, indicating multiple ports or services.  The keys are a mix of `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` types.  There's a single entry for `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` which includes all three key types.  The frequent appearance of multiple key types for the same host suggests a robust security setup.  The changes represent a comprehensive update to the known hosts file, likely reflecting the addition or update of multiple servers.


## 10:30:16 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Gre/GreStandalone.robot` (last updated 5/6/2025, 10:08:04 AM) tests a Gre plugin in a Conductor-to-Combo topology.  The suite uses numerous custom libraries (InitRobot, T128, ConductorUtils, CliLib, Installer, RestLib, NodeConnectivity, Session, ShowInterface) and resources (PluginsCommon, TestbedStore, Utils, BaseSuiteVariables, GreStandaloneUtils).

The test heavily utilizes SSH and CLI connections to multiple DUTs (DUT1, DUT2, DUT3).  A significant portion of the code involves configuring network interfaces (using `ifup`, `ifdown`, and template files in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts`), setting up GRE tunnels, and verifying connectivity (using ping and checking for session existence via `pcli`).  The setup includes installing and verifying the `128T-gre` plugin on the Conductor (DUT1) and configuring peers (DUT3) and the combo device (DUT2).  Salt is used for configuration management.

Keywords like `Configure Device With Template`, `Fill Dpdk Template`, `Fill Tunnel Template` suggest a templating mechanism for network configuration.  Several keywords handle connection setup/teardown and wait for various conditions (using `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` with timeouts). The tests extensively use suite variables to manage SSH connections, CLI connections, REST connections, and device information.  There are separate test cases to verify summary and detail plugin states.  The configuration involves IP addresses from the `10.10.10` range.  Error handling appears limited, relying primarily on timeouts in `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` to manage potential failures.


## 10:47:32 AM
The log shows a single entry on May 6th, 2025 at 10:10:05 AM, documenting changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file.  This file contains SSH host key information for various IP addresses and hostnames.  The update added or updated entries for several hosts, including `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` and multiple IP addresses in the `10.27.*.*` range.  Multiple key types are present (ssh-ed25519, ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256) for some of the hosts, indicating a variety of authentication methods are in use. Some IP addresses have multiple entries, possibly for different ports (e.g., `[10.27.15.13]:12811`, `[10.27.15.13]:12807`).  The pattern shows a consistent addition or refresh of SSH host keys for numerous network locations.


## 11:30:16 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `GreStandalone.robot` (last updated 5/6/2025, 11:09:27 AM) tests a GRE plugin configuration in a Conductor-to-Combo topology.  It uses numerous libraries (`InitRobot.py`, `T128.py`, `ConductorUtils.py`, `CliLib.py`, `Installer.py`, `RestLib.py`, `NodeConnectivity.py`, `Session.py`, `ShowInterface.py`) and resources (`PluginsCommon.robot`, `TestbedStore.robot`, `Utils.robot`, `BaseSuiteVariables.robot`, `GreStandaloneUtils.robot`).

The test suite sets up connections to three DUTs (DUT1, DUT2, DUT3), using SSH and REST connections.  A significant portion of the code focuses on configuring network interfaces (using `ifup`, `ifdown`, and manipulating `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts` files) and GRE tunnels on these devices.  Specific configurations are applied via CLI commands.  The test verifies the GRE tunnel functionality through ping and checks the plugin's status using REST API calls and CLI commands.  Keywords like `Configure Device With Template`, `Fill Dpdk Template`, and `Fill Tunnel Template` suggest a templating approach for device configuration.  The test includes extensive error handling with multiple `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` calls with timeouts ranging from 1 minute 15 seconds to 4 minutes 15 seconds.  The test suite verifies connection status, plugin installation, and overall GRE tunnel operation.  The variables define network settings,  topology details (using `topologies/three_duts/ConductorToTwoComboSimple.robot`), and plugin-specific parameters.


## 12:30:16 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Gre/GreStandalone.robot` (last updated 5/6/2025, 11:58:29 AM) tests a Conductor-to-Combo topology with the GRE plugin.  It uses numerous libraries (InitRobot, T128, ConductorUtils, CliLib, Installer, RestLib, NodeConnectivity, Session, ShowInterface) and resources (PluginsCommon, TestbedStore, Utils, BaseSuiteVariables, GreStandaloneUtils).

The test suite sets up connections to three DUTs (DUT1, DUT2, DUT3), using SSH and CLI connections.  It then installs and verifies the GRE plugin on the Conductor (DUT1).  A significant portion of the code focuses on configuring the GRE tunnel on DUT2 (Combo) and DUT3 (Peer), including configuring interfaces (`dpdk1`, `dpdk2`, `combo-tunnel`, `peer-tunnel`), IP addresses, routing, and firewall settings.  The test verifies connectivity over the GRE tunnel using `ping` and checks the plugin status via CLI commands and REST API calls.  Keywords like `Configure Device With Template`, `Fill Dpdk Template`, `Fill Tunnel Template` suggest a templating system for device configuration.  Several keywords involve waiting for operations to complete, indicating asynchronous processes.  The test also includes validation steps checking for the expected state of the tunnel and related components.  Finally, the test uses a detailed and summary state verification leveraging REST API calls.


## 2:30:16 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/BGP/BgpOverSvr.robot` (last updated 5/6/2025, 1:31:26 PM) verifies BGP over SVR functionality.  It uses several custom libraries (InitRobot, T128, CliLib, BgpLib, FibCheck, Spirent, TrafficLibrary, ProvisionalStatusLib) and resources (Utils.robot, BaseSuiteVariables.robot, BgpCommon.robot).

The test suite includes variables defining topology, legacy initialization flag, and maximum FIB entries.  Key test cases focus on verifying BGP routes,  initially checking for zero routes and subsequently checking for a specific `DEFAULT NUMBER OF ROUTES`.  The tests extensively use keywords like `Poll Bgp Routes Until Count From Conductor`, `Set Provisional Status On`, and functions to configure 128T routers for BGP with and without SVR and PIM.  Verification steps involve checking BGP routes on all DUTs, both with and without routing interfaces, and also verifying these routes within the FIB (Forwarding Information Base) using expected nexthop addresses for specific service prefixes.  Multiple `Poll FIB` keywords ensure that expectations are met.  The tests utilize various DUTs (DUT1, DUT2, DUT3) and their associated connection details, BGP configurations, and IP addresses.  The configuration varies across tests including BGP over SVR with and without PIM.  The test suite exhibits a consistent pattern of setting up testbeds, configuring routers, polling for route counts, and verifying expected states.
