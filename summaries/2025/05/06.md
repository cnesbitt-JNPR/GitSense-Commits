# Activity Summary for 5/6/2025

## 9:47:32 AM
The log shows updates to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file on 5/6/2025 at 9:21:26 AM.  The file contains SSH host keys for various IP addresses and hostnames.  The majority of entries are for IP addresses in the `10.27.*.*` range, with several entries for the same IP address, indicating multiple ports or services.  The keys are a mix of `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` types.  There's a single entry for `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` which includes all three key types.  The frequent appearance of multiple key types for the same host suggests a robust security setup.  The changes represent a comprehensive update to the known hosts file, likely reflecting the addition or update of multiple servers.
