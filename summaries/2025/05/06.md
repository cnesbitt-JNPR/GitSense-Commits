# Activity Summary for 5/6/2025

## 9:47:32 AM
The log shows updates to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file on 5/6/2025 at 9:21:26 AM.  The file contains SSH host keys for various IP addresses and hostnames.  The majority of entries are for IP addresses in the `10.27.*.*` range, with several entries for the same IP address, indicating multiple ports or services.  The keys are a mix of `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` types.  There's a single entry for `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` which includes all three key types.  The frequent appearance of multiple key types for the same host suggests a robust security setup.  The changes represent a comprehensive update to the known hosts file, likely reflecting the addition or update of multiple servers.

The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Gre/GreStandalone.robot` (last updated 5/6/2025, 10:08:04 AM) tests a Gre plugin in a Conductor-to-Combo topology.  The suite uses numerous custom libraries (InitRobot, T128, ConductorUtils, CliLib, Installer, RestLib, NodeConnectivity, Session, ShowInterface) and resources (PluginsCommon, TestbedStore, Utils, BaseSuiteVariables, GreStandaloneUtils).

The test heavily utilizes SSH and CLI connections to multiple DUTs (DUT1, DUT2, DUT3).  A significant portion of the code involves configuring network interfaces (using `ifup`, `ifdown`, and template files in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts`), setting up GRE tunnels, and verifying connectivity (using ping and checking for session existence via `pcli`).  The setup includes installing and verifying the `128T-gre` plugin on the Conductor (DUT1) and configuring peers (DUT3) and the combo device (DUT2).  Salt is used for configuration management.

Keywords like `Configure Device With Template`, `Fill Dpdk Template`, `Fill Tunnel Template` suggest a templating mechanism for network configuration.  Several keywords handle connection setup/teardown and wait for various conditions (using `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` with timeouts). The tests extensively use suite variables to manage SSH connections, CLI connections, REST connections, and device information.  There are separate test cases to verify summary and detail plugin states.  The configuration involves IP addresses from the `10.10.10` range.  Error handling appears limited, relying primarily on timeouts in `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` to manage potential failures.


## 10:47:32 AM
The log shows a single entry on May 6th, 2025 at 10:10:05 AM, documenting changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file.  This file contains SSH host key information for various IP addresses and hostnames.  The update added or updated entries for several hosts, including `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` and multiple IP addresses in the `10.27.*.*` range.  Multiple key types are present (ssh-ed25519, ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256) for some of the hosts, indicating a variety of authentication methods are in use. Some IP addresses have multiple entries, possibly for different ports (e.g., `[10.27.15.13]:12811`, `[10.27.15.13]:12807`).  The pattern shows a consistent addition or refresh of SSH host keys for numerous network locations.
