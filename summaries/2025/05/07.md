# Activity Summary for 5/7/2025

## 4:30:16 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/BGP/BgpOverSvr.robot` was updated on 5/7/2025, 4:19:58 PM.  The update primarily involves modifications to keywords within the test suite.  The actual test cases were deleted,  with a note indicating this change should not be committed.

The updated keywords focus on BGP configuration and verification, particularly testing BGP over Segment Routing VPN (SRV) functionality.  Many keywords utilize libraries like `BgpLib`, `CliLib`, and `FibCheck` to interact with the system under test.  Several keywords (`Configure 128T routers for BGP`, `Configure 128T routers for BGP over SVR`, etc.) suggest testing various BGP configurations, including those with and without SRV and PIM.

The keywords extensively use variables like `${DUT1_CONN}`, `${DUT2_ROUTER}`, `${DUT3_BGP_LOOPBACK_IP}`, etc., implying a multi-DUT (Device Under Test) test environment.  The `Poll Bgp Routes Until Count From Conductor` keyword is repeatedly used to verify BGP route propagation.  Similarly, `Verify BGP Routes In FIB On All DUTS` and its variations are used for verifying routes in the Forwarding Information Base (FIB). The test suite uses resources like `BgpCommon.robot` and `Utils.robot` for shared functionalities and variables.  The `topologies/three_duts/ConductorToTwoCombos.robot` file is referenced, suggesting a topology with three DUTs and a conductor.  The update includes changes to the setup and teardown sections, involving testbed setup and connection management.
