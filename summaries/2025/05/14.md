# Activity Summary for 5/14/2025

## 12:43:17 PM
The log file `/Users/cnesbitt/Downloads/Alarm Shelving Testing/logs_ComboEast/configDirector.log` records the startup of the `configDirector` application on May 13, 2025, at 19:06:43.  The application initialized various logging modules (ATCS, CFGD, DATA, etc.) to INFO level (4).  It attempted to load configuration from JSON and then XML datastores, encountering errors due to parsing failures.  As a result, it fell back to loading factory default configurations for both `t128` and `user` config types.  The application successfully connected to Zookeeper at `127.0.0.1:2181`, started a REST server on `/var/run/128technology/configDirector.sock`, and detected the `mist-wan-assurance` config hook.  The application noted that it's not running on a conductor and proceeded to build a configuration for a multi-router environment. The `IdpRouterBuilder` operated in disabled mode. Finally, the application completed its configuration building process and started its signal handling thread, indicating successful startup at 19:06:43.822.  The log shows a significant amount of activity centered around configuration loading and generation, highlighting challenges with loading from JSON and XML stores and the successful fallback to default configurations.


## 4:13:41 PM
The log shows two entries for `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/AlarmShelfEvaluator.cpp`, both on May 14, 2025.  The first entry is at 4:05:52 PM and the second at 4:07:58 PM.  The code content is identical in both entries, suggesting that the second entry might represent a redundant log entry or a failed attempt to update the file, rather than an actual code change.  The code itself defines a class `AlarmShelfEvaluator` which manages alarm shelving based on various conditions, such as router maintenance mode and configuration changes.  It interacts with an `alarmTable`, allowing for adding, removing, and reevaluating alarms within shelves.  The class uses logging (`InfoLog`, `DebugLog`) extensively for debugging and monitoring.  The code handles adding and removing shelves, updating shelving status, and reevaluating alarms based on different actions.  There is no functional change between the two logged versions.


## 5:13:43 PM
The code changes primarily involve the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/test/AlarmShelfEvaluatorTest.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/AlarmShelfEvaluator.cpp` files.  The unit tests in `AlarmShelfEvaluatorTest.cpp` underwent minor revisions between 4:39 PM and 4:59 PM on May 14, 2025.  The most significant change within this file was a correction in the `alarmShelfEvaluatorWithEmptyResource` test case. Initially, it used `dolly::fbstring` for representing an empty resource, which was later changed to the more appropriate `alarms::Resource empty_alarm_resource;`  This change likely reflects a refinement to correctly handle empty resource scenarios in alarm shelving.  The behavior of the test was also changed to reflect the change, resulting in `EXPECT_FALSE` instead of `EXPECT_TRUE` after the `loadConfigWithShelf` call.

The `AlarmShelfEvaluator.cpp` file saw a change at 4:59:24 PM, and again at 5:01:33 PM on May 14, 2025. The changes between these timestamps are minimal; the only difference was correcting a logical error in the `handleShelfAdded` function where a `return;` statement was uncommented to ensure that shelves with empty resources are skipped, as indicated by the InfoLog message.  This is consistent with the fix made in the unit test for this function.

Throughout both files, there is consistent use of the `alarms`, `app`, `cfg`, `config`, `state`, and `trait` namespaces, indicating a well-structured codebase within a larger system. The code focuses on alarm shelving management, with functions to add, remove, and update shelves based on configuration changes and alarm events.  The use of unit tests demonstrates a focus on testing and ensuring the correct functionality of alarm shelving.
