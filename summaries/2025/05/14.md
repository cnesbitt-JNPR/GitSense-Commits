# Activity Summary for 5/14/2025

## 12:43:17 PM
The log file `/Users/cnesbitt/Downloads/Alarm Shelving Testing/logs_ComboEast/configDirector.log` records the startup of the `configDirector` application on May 13, 2025, at 19:06:43.  The application initialized various logging modules (ATCS, CFGD, DATA, etc.) to INFO level (4).  It attempted to load configuration from JSON and then XML datastores, encountering errors due to parsing failures.  As a result, it fell back to loading factory default configurations for both `t128` and `user` config types.  The application successfully connected to Zookeeper at `127.0.0.1:2181`, started a REST server on `/var/run/128technology/configDirector.sock`, and detected the `mist-wan-assurance` config hook.  The application noted that it's not running on a conductor and proceeded to build a configuration for a multi-router environment. The `IdpRouterBuilder` operated in disabled mode. Finally, the application completed its configuration building process and started its signal handling thread, indicating successful startup at 19:06:43.822.  The log shows a significant amount of activity centered around configuration loading and generation, highlighting challenges with loading from JSON and XML stores and the successful fallback to default configurations.


## 4:13:41 PM
The log shows two entries for `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/AlarmShelfEvaluator.cpp`, both on May 14, 2025.  The first entry is at 4:05:52 PM and the second at 4:07:58 PM.  The code content is identical in both entries, suggesting that the second entry might represent a redundant log entry or a failed attempt to update the file, rather than an actual code change.  The code itself defines a class `AlarmShelfEvaluator` which manages alarm shelving based on various conditions, such as router maintenance mode and configuration changes.  It interacts with an `alarmTable`, allowing for adding, removing, and reevaluating alarms within shelves.  The class uses logging (`InfoLog`, `DebugLog`) extensively for debugging and monitoring.  The code handles adding and removing shelves, updating shelving status, and reevaluating alarms based on different actions.  There is no functional change between the two logged versions.
