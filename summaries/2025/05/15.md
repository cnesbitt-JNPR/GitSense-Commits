# Activity Summary for 5/15/2025

## 9:53:09 AM
The log shows a single entry at 5/15/2025, 9:20:22 AM, updating the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file.  This file contains SSH host keys for various IP addresses and hostnames.  The updates add or modify entries for multiple hosts, predominantly using  `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` key types.  Several entries are associated with the IP address `10.27.15.13`, with different ports (12811, 12801, 12806, 12809).  There's also a recurring `ssh-rsa` key appearing for multiple hosts (10.27.35.129, 10.27.35.202, and 10.27.34.127).  The file appears to be a record of known hosts for SSH connections.


## 3:53:10 PM
The log shows a single update to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file on 5/15/2025 at 2:56:43 PM.  This update consists of adding or updating numerous SSH host keys for various IP addresses and hostnames.  The entries include different key types (ssh-ed25519, ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256).  Several IP addresses, notably `10.27.15.13`, appear multiple times with different port numbers (e.g., `[10.27.15.13]:12811`, `[10.27.15.13]:12801`), suggesting multiple services running on those IPs.  One RSA key (present for `10.27.35.50`, `10.27.34.127`, and `10.27.35.202`) is identical across multiple entries which may indicate a shared key configuration.  The update reflects a change in the known hosts configuration, likely resulting from adding new hosts or updating existing host keys.
