# Activity Summary for 5/16/2025

## 9:57:48 AM
The log shows a single modification to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/tools/centos-upstream.repo` on May 16, 2025, at 9:07:06 AM.  This file appears to be a CentOS 7 repository configuration file. The update defines three repositories: `centos-7-upstream-base`, `centos-7-upstream-updates`, and `centos-7-upstream-extras`.  All three repositories use the same GPG key from Juniper's Artifactory server and are enabled with a priority of 30.  The key pattern is the use of consistent base URLs pointing to different directories within the Artifactory server for base, updates, and extras packages.
