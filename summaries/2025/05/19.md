# Activity Summary for 5/19/2025

## 3:15:48 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/config/AlarmShelvingObserver` files (`.cpp` and `.hpp`).  The changes primarily focus on the `findModifiedShelves` function within the `AlarmShelvingObserver` class.

The initial version (5/19/2025, 2:44:27 PM) utilized helper functions `findAddedShelfList` and `findRemovedShelfList` which employed `std::set_difference` for determining added and removed shelves.

A significant refactor occurred between 2:52:11 PM and 2:53:14 PM.  The `findModifiedShelves` function was rewritten to directly identify added and removed shelves using a `while` loop and a series of `if/else if` conditions that iterated over the old and new shelf lists. This replaced the use of `findAddedShelfList` and `findRemovedShelfList`, which were commented out.  The return type changed to a `std::tuple` to return both lists simultaneously.  The `.hpp` file was updated at 2:52:46 PM to reflect this change in the function signature.

Between 3:08:52 PM and 3:09:07 PM, minor improvements were made to the `findModifiedShelves` function. The `switch` statement was replaced by a more readable `if-else if` chain to improve clarity and the comments were slightly altered.  The commented-out helper functions remained unchanged.  These final changes likely improved the code's readability and maintainability without altering the core functionality.  All changes were made on May 19, 2025.


## 4:15:51 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/config/AlarmShelvingObserver.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/config/AlarmShelvingObserver.hpp` files between 3:17 PM and 4:08 PM on May 19, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the `findModifiedShelves` method within the `AlarmShelvingObserver` class.

Initially, `findModifiedShelves` was commented out, with `findRemovedShelfList` and `findAddedShelfList` (which used `std::set_difference`)  being used instead.  There was a comment indicating an assumption that the input lists were sorted.

Between 3:25 PM and 3:26 PM, the `findModifiedShelves` method was implemented iteratively, using iterators instead of `std::set_difference`, leveraging the already sorted nature of `AlarmShelving::ShelfList` (a `dolly::sorted_vector_set`). This iterative approach directly compares elements in the old and new lists, correctly identifying added and removed shelves.  A minor correction was made in the iteration condition and the `insert` method was used to add elements to the result lists instead of `push_back`.

At 3:44 PM and 3:45 PM, the commented-out `findRemovedShelfList` and `findAddedShelfList` functions were reinstated, indicating a potential reversion to the original implementation using `std::set_difference`. However, by 4:02 PM, this reversion was undone and  `findModifiedShelves` remained the active implementation.

Finally, at 4:07 PM, the `findModifiedShelves` function was modified to return the lists using `std::move` for improved efficiency by avoiding unnecessary copies. The commented-out `findRemovedShelfList` and `findAddedShelfList` functions remained.  Simultaneously, the header file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/config/AlarmShelvingObserver.hpp` was updated to reflect the final class definition, which includes the `findModifiedShelves` method but not `findRemovedShelfList` and `findAddedShelfList`.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/config/test/AlarmShelvingObserverTest.cpp` file was also modified at 3:38 PM, adding several test cases (`emptyShelvesConfig`, `addRemoveAlarmShelvingConfig`, `addRemoveShelvesConfig`, `modifyShelvesConfig`, `cancelShelvesConfig`) designed to thoroughly test the `AlarmShelvingObserver` class's functionality, particularly focusing on adding, removing, and modifying alarm shelves.  These tests use mock objects and various configurations to verify the expected behavior of the `handleShelfAdded` and `handleShelfRemoved` methods.
