# Activity Summary for 5/19/2025

## 3:15:48 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/config/AlarmShelvingObserver` files (`.cpp` and `.hpp`).  The changes primarily focus on the `findModifiedShelves` function within the `AlarmShelvingObserver` class.

The initial version (5/19/2025, 2:44:27 PM) utilized helper functions `findAddedShelfList` and `findRemovedShelfList` which employed `std::set_difference` for determining added and removed shelves.

A significant refactor occurred between 2:52:11 PM and 2:53:14 PM.  The `findModifiedShelves` function was rewritten to directly identify added and removed shelves using a `while` loop and a series of `if/else if` conditions that iterated over the old and new shelf lists. This replaced the use of `findAddedShelfList` and `findRemovedShelfList`, which were commented out.  The return type changed to a `std::tuple` to return both lists simultaneously.  The `.hpp` file was updated at 2:52:46 PM to reflect this change in the function signature.

Between 3:08:52 PM and 3:09:07 PM, minor improvements were made to the `findModifiedShelves` function. The `switch` statement was replaced by a more readable `if-else if` chain to improve clarity and the comments were slightly altered.  The commented-out helper functions remained unchanged.  These final changes likely improved the code's readability and maintainability without altering the core functionality.  All changes were made on May 19, 2025.
