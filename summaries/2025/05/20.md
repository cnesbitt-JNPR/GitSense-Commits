# Activity Summary for 5/20/2025

## 1:15:47 PM
The log shows two nearly identical versions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/config/AlarmShelvingObserver.cpp`,  recorded 25 seconds apart (12:28:19 PM and 12:28:44 PM on 5/20/2025).  The only substantive difference is a minor clarification in a comment within the `findModifiedShelves` function. The original comment stated that `AlarmShelving::Shelf operator<()` only compares the name. The updated comment clarifies that this applies to the operator and that `operator==()` compares the entire shelf. The code itself, which implements an observer pattern for managing alarm shelving, remains unchanged otherwise.  The code handles adding, removing, and modifying alarm shelves, utilizing a `dolly::sorted_vector_set` for efficient comparison and modification operations.  Trace logging is used to track the number of shelves added and removed.
