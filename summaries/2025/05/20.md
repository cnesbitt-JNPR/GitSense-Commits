# Activity Summary for 5/20/2025

## 1:15:47 PM
The log shows two nearly identical versions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/config/AlarmShelvingObserver.cpp`,  recorded 25 seconds apart (12:28:19 PM and 12:28:44 PM on 5/20/2025).  The only substantive difference is a minor clarification in a comment within the `findModifiedShelves` function. The original comment stated that `AlarmShelving::Shelf operator<()` only compares the name. The updated comment clarifies that this applies to the operator and that `operator==()` compares the entire shelf. The code itself, which implements an observer pattern for managing alarm shelving, remains unchanged otherwise.  The code handles adding, removing, and modifying alarm shelves, utilizing a `dolly::sorted_vector_set` for efficient comparison and modification operations.  Trace logging is used to track the number of shelves added and removed.


## 3:19:47 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/Matcher.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/AlarmResponseBuilder.cpp` between 2:24 PM and 3:02 PM on May 20, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on clarifying comments within `Matcher.cpp` regarding the `INTERFACE` category's relationship to  `NETWORK_INTERFACE` and `GIID` categories, emphasizing consistency with the GUI's representation in `AlarmResponseBuilder.cpp`.  The comments in `Matcher.cpp` were refined across multiple commits to improve clarity on how the `INTERFACE` category maps to the underlying `state::Category`.

`AlarmResponseBuilder.cpp`  underwent several updates during this period. Although the code itself remained largely unchanged, comments were added and modified in the `categoryFromStateCategory` function to explicitly state the required consistency between this function and the alarm shelving logic in `CategoryMatcher::doIsMatch`.  This highlights a concerted effort to maintain consistency between the application logic and its GUI representation.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/MatcherTest.cpp` file shows the addition of a `makeTestMatchedGIIDAlarm` function around 3:02 PM,  and a corresponding adjustment to the `categoryMatcher` test to include this new alarm type, verifying that the `INTERFACE` category correctly handles `GIID` alarms.  This suggests that additional testing was added to address and validate the changes made to the `INTERFACE` category handling.


## 4:19:02 PM
The log shows three revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/Matcher.cpp`, all within a short timeframe on May 20, 2025.  The code defines various matchers for alarms, including: `AllMatcher`, `NoneMatcher`, `CategoryMatcher`, `SeverityMatcher`, `ShelvedStatusMatcher`, `FieldMatcher`, `FieldRegexMatcher`, `ResourceMatcher`, and `CompositeMatcher`.

The primary changes between revisions involve a single line of code within the `CategoryMatcher::doIsMatch` function.  Specifically, a commented-out section that handled a special case for `INTERFACE` shelf was initially present, then removed in the second revision, and finally reinstated in the third revision.  This suggests an iterative debugging or feature toggling process related to how the `INTERFACE` category is handled.  The timestamps indicate that these modifications occurred within a few minutes of each other (3:33 PM, 3:35 PM, and 3:37 PM).  No other significant changes are observed across the revisions; the rest of the code remains consistent.  The overall purpose of the code is to provide a flexible and extensible framework for matching alarms based on various criteria.
