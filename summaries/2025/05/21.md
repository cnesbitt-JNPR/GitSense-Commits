The log shows a single update to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file on 5/21/2025 at 11:54:18 AM.  This file contains SSH host keys for various IP addresses and hostnames.  Multiple key types are present, including `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`.  The entries predominantly consist of IP addresses in the 10.27.x.x range, with some entries also specifying port numbers (e.g., `[10.27.15.13]:12811`).  One hostname, `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, is also present. There's a repeated `ssh-rsa` key present for multiple IP addresses, suggesting potential for consolidation or error.
