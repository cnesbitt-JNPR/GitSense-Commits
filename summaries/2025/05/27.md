# Activity Summary for 5/27/2025

The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmShelving.robot`, updated on May 27, 2025, at 10:54:45 AM, focuses on verifying alarm shelving functionality on an HA router.  The suite uses several resource and library files for common functionalities, including audit, testbed management, alarm handling, Linux interaction, SSH, system registry, tunnels, and T128 interactions.

The test cases systematically verify alarm shelving based on various criteria: router name (exact and regex), node name (exact and regex), resource path, category (network-interface), severity (info), message (regex), and different match types (ANY and ALL). Each test case follows a pattern:  add an alarm shelf with specific parameters, verify the "Admin Down" alarm is shelved, delete the shelf, and verify the alarm is no longer shelved.  One test case (`Verify Modify Shelves`) demonstrates modifying shelf criteria.

The `Setup Alarm Shelving Suite` and `Teardown Alarm Shelving Suite` keywords manage test setup and cleanup, including establishing Linux connections, configuring network interfaces (using `Add Kni Interface` and `Delete Kni Interface`), and verifying connectivity and the absence of alarms (`Verify All Devices Have No Alarms`).  The keywords utilize a T128 connection (`Get T128 Connection`, `Configure T128 On`, `Close T128 Connection`) for configuration tasks. The suite uses several custom keywords like `Wait For Stable Connectivity Between All Duts`, `Verify Stable Connectivity`, `Verify All Node Connectivity`, `Verify Registered Services Exist For Node`, and `Verify All Tunnels To Destination Connected`.  The `Get Expected Alarms List` keyword is used to define expected alarms for verification. The tests utilize variables for defining the topology, interface names, and other parameters, making the test suite configurable.  A commented-out section suggests future tests for resource shelving.  The `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` tags suggest regular nightly execution on both stable and Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems.
