The Robot Framework test suite `AlarmShelving.robot` (last updated 5/28/2025, 12:40:29 PM) verifies alarm shelving functionality on an HA router.  It uses several resource files (`AuditCommon.robot`, `TestbedStore.robot`, `AlarmCommon.robot`, `BaseSuiteVariables.robot`) and numerous libraries for system interactions (Linux, SSH, T128, etc.).

The suite focuses on testing alarm shelving based on various criteria: router name, router name regex, node name, node name regex, category, severity, and message regex.  Each test case follows a consistent pattern:  setting up shelf parameters, adding the shelf, verifying an alarm is shelved, deleting the shelf, and verifying the alarm is no longer shelved.  A commented-out section suggests planned tests for resource-based shelving.  The tests heavily utilize the `Add Alarm Shelf` and `Delete Alarm Shelf` keywords.  A `Verify Admin Down Alarm` keyword (in several variations: `Is Shelved`, `Is Not Shelved`) is centrally used to validate the test outcomes.   The tests also include variations to test "any" and "all" match types for shelf criteria.  Finally, modification of existing shelves is tested.

The `Setup Alarm Shelving Suite` and `Teardown Alarm Shelving Suite` keywords manage test setup and cleanup, including actions like setting up and deleting a KNI interface (`kniTest`), establishing Linux connections, and verifying network connectivity.  The teardown includes restoring the KNI interface to an enabled state.  The `Get Expected Alarms List` keyword is used to define expected alarms for verification.  There's a significant amount of code dedicated to T128 configuration for the KNI interface manipulation.
