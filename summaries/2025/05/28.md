# Activity Summary for 5/28/2025

## 1:22:52 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `AlarmShelving.robot` (last updated 5/28/2025, 12:40:29 PM) verifies alarm shelving functionality on an HA router.  It uses several resource files (`AuditCommon.robot`, `TestbedStore.robot`, `AlarmCommon.robot`, `BaseSuiteVariables.robot`) and numerous libraries for system interactions (Linux, SSH, T128, etc.).

The suite focuses on testing alarm shelving based on various criteria: router name, router name regex, node name, node name regex, category, severity, and message regex.  Each test case follows a consistent pattern:  setting up shelf parameters, adding the shelf, verifying an alarm is shelved, deleting the shelf, and verifying the alarm is no longer shelved.  A commented-out section suggests planned tests for resource-based shelving.  The tests heavily utilize the `Add Alarm Shelf` and `Delete Alarm Shelf` keywords.  A `Verify Admin Down Alarm` keyword (in several variations: `Is Shelved`, `Is Not Shelved`) is centrally used to validate the test outcomes.   The tests also include variations to test "any" and "all" match types for shelf criteria.  Finally, modification of existing shelves is tested.

The `Setup Alarm Shelving Suite` and `Teardown Alarm Shelving Suite` keywords manage test setup and cleanup, including actions like setting up and deleting a KNI interface (`kniTest`), establishing Linux connections, and verifying network connectivity.  The teardown includes restoring the KNI interface to an enabled state.  The `Get Expected Alarms List` keyword is used to define expected alarms for verification.  There's a significant amount of code dedicated to T128 configuration for the KNI interface manipulation.

The log shows two commits to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/config/AlarmShelvingObserver.cpp`, both on May 28, 2025.  The first commit at 1:28:26 PM contains the initial implementation of the `AlarmShelvingObserver` class. This class handles adding, removing, and modifying alarm shelves.  The core logic involves iterating through shelf lists (`AlarmShelving::ShelfList`), using `std::for_each` for efficient processing.  The `findModifiedShelves` function identifies added and removed shelves by comparing two sorted lists, utilizing an algorithm similar to `std::set_difference`.  TraceLog statements are used for logging actions.

The second commit, at 1:31:16 PM, is a minor update to the `findModifiedShelves` function.  The key change is the addition of `TraceLog` statements within the `while` loop of the `findModifiedShelves` function to provide more detailed logging of shelf modifications (add, remove, replace, or skip).  This improves the traceability of shelf changes within the modification process.  The log messages now specify whether a shelf is added, removed, replaced, or skipped during the comparison, enhancing debugging and monitoring capabilities.  No functional changes were made beyond the added logging.

The log shows updates to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file on 5/28/2025, 4:24:07 PM.  The file contains SSH host keys for various IP addresses and hostnames.  Multiple key types are present, including `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`.  Several entries are for the same IP address `10.27.15.13`, but with different ports (12811, 12801, 12805, 12807, 12804, 12809). Another recurring pattern is the repeated presence of the same `ssh-rsa` key for multiple IP addresses (10.27.34.127, 10.27.35.202).  The log indicates the addition or update of host keys, a common activity during SSH connections and configuration.
