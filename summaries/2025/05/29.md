# Activity Summary for 5/29/2025

## 3:43:00 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmShelving.robot` underwent two revisions on May 29, 2025.  The first revision at 3:13:24 PM and the second at 3:26:04 PM show no substantive changes in the code. Both versions extensively test alarm shelving functionality on an HA router.  The tests cover various scenarios, including shelving alarms based on router name, node name, resource, category, severity, and message using both exact match and regular expression matching.  Each test case follows a pattern: adding an alarm shelf with specific criteria, verifying the alarm is shelved, deleting the shelf, and verifying the alarm is no longer shelved.  Several keywords are defined for setting up and tearing down the test environment, managing network connectivity, and interacting with the T128 system. One section (`Verify Resource Shelf`) is commented out, indicating potential work in progress or a temporarily disabled test. The `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` tags suggest these tests are part of a nightly build process for both stable and RHEL-specific builds.  The code uses variables extensively, such as `${DUT2_ROUTER}`, `${DUT2_NODE_NAME}`, and `${KNI_INTF_NAME}`, to parametrize the tests. No changes are observed between the two revisions.
