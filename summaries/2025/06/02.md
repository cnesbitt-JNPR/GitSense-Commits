# Activity Summary for 6/2/2025

## 12:43:01 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `AlarmShelving.robot` (last updated 6/2/2025, 12:17:18 PM) focuses on verifying alarm shelving functionality on an HA router.  It uses numerous resources (`AuditCommon.robot`, `TestbedStore.robot`, `AlarmCommon.robot`, `variable_files/BaseSuiteVariables.robot`) and libraries (including `User.py`, `InitRobot.py`, `AlarmHandlerLib.py`, and several others related to Linux, SSH, system registry, tunnels, and T128).

The test suite defines several test cases, each verifying alarm shelving based on different criteria: router name, router name regex, node name, node name regex, category (network-interface, interface), severity (info), message regex, and different match types (ANY and ALL).  Each test case follows a pattern:  setting up shelf parameters, adding an alarm shelf, verifying the alarm is shelved, deleting the shelf, and verifying the alarm is no longer shelved.  A commented-out section suggests planned testing for resource-based shelving.

The `Setup Alarm Shelving Suite` and `Teardown Alarm Shelving Suite` keywords manage test environment setup and cleanup, including establishing Linux connections, configuring network interfaces (specifically a KNI interface), and ensuring stable connectivity between devices.  Keywords like `Verify Admin Down Alarm Is Shelved` and `Verify Admin Down Alarm Is Not Shelved` rely on the `Verify Current Alarms` and `Verify Shelved Alarms` keywords, which manage the verification process and handle expected and ignored alarms.  The `Add Kni Interface` and `Delete Kni Interface` keywords use T128 connections for configuration.  The suite utilizes variables extensively to parameterize test cases and manage device information. The tests are tagged with `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel`, suggesting a nightly execution and RHEL-specific focus.
