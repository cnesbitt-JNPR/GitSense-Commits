# Activity Summary for 6/3/2025

## 8:43:02 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmShelving.robot` underwent several revisions on June 3rd, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be refining the alarm shelving functionality.

The initial version (8:30:52 AM) contained a comprehensive set of test cases (`Verify Router Name Shelf`, `Verify Router Name Regex Shelf`, etc.) designed to verify alarm shelving based on various criteria (router name, node name, regex matching, category, severity, and message).  A commented-out section suggests future tests for resource-based shelving. The suite uses numerous Robot Framework libraries for tasks like SSH, Linux system interaction, and T128 configuration.

Subsequent updates (8:36:42 AM and 8:36:50 AM) show no significant code alterations.  The changes were minimal, likely addressing minor formatting or whitespace issues. The keyword `Get Expected Alarms List` was changed to `Get Network Interface Alarms List` indicating a refinement in how expected alarms are obtained.

The final revision (8:39:20 AM) introduced a key change: the addition of a new test case, `Verify Giid Alarm Is Shelved`, and the modification of the `Verify Interface Category Shelf` test case's teardown to include this new verification.  This indicates a shift in testing to include GIID (Global Interface ID) alarms specifically. The `Verify Admin Down Alarm Is Shelved` keyword was replaced with `Verify Giid Alarm Is Shelved`  in this last update, showing a focus shift from testing Admin Down alarms to GIID alarms.  The overall structure and library dependencies remained consistent throughout all revisions.  The `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` tags suggest these tests are part of a nightly build and testing process.

The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmShelving.robot` underwent several revisions on June 3rd, 2025.  The primary focus is testing alarm shelving functionality on an HA router.  Multiple test cases verify shelving based on various criteria: router name, router name regex, node name, node name regex, category (network-interface, interface), severity (info), message regex, and match type (any, all).  Each test case follows a consistent pattern: setting variables, adding an alarm shelf using `Add Alarm Shelf`, verifying the alarm is shelved (`Verify Admin Down Alarm Is Shelved` or `Verify Giid Alarm Is Shelved`), deleting the shelf using `Delete Alarm Shelf`, and then verifying the alarm is no longer shelved.

A commented-out section suggests a planned test case for resource-based shelving that was not enabled at the time of these commits (likely due to issue I95-56849).  The keywords section shows extensive use of T128 configuration (`Get T128 Connection`, `Configure T128 On`, `Close T128 Connection`) for managing network interfaces and inducing/clearing alarms.  The `Add Alarm Shelf` and `Delete Alarm Shelf` keywords utilize API calls (`Execute Sudo API Request`) to interact with a system for managing alarm shelving.  There are multiple revisions refining the test suite and improving the keyword definitions.  The final versions around 9:39 AM show a cleaned-up version with the keyword definitions fully fleshed out.  The changes between 9:14 AM and 9:39 AM are primarily the addition of comprehensive keyword definitions for actions like adding, deleting, and managing alarm shelves through API requests and T128 configuration.  The change between 9:21:02 AM and 9:21:38 AM focuses on a small modification to the `Teardown` section of the `Verify Interface Category Shelf` test case, removing unnecessary `Network ${netintf}` from the teardown keyword call.
