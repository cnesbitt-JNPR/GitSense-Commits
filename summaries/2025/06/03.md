# Activity Summary for 6/3/2025

## 8:43:02 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmShelving.robot` underwent several revisions on June 3rd, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be refining the alarm shelving functionality.

The initial version (8:30:52 AM) contained a comprehensive set of test cases (`Verify Router Name Shelf`, `Verify Router Name Regex Shelf`, etc.) designed to verify alarm shelving based on various criteria (router name, node name, regex matching, category, severity, and message).  A commented-out section suggests future tests for resource-based shelving. The suite uses numerous Robot Framework libraries for tasks like SSH, Linux system interaction, and T128 configuration.

Subsequent updates (8:36:42 AM and 8:36:50 AM) show no significant code alterations.  The changes were minimal, likely addressing minor formatting or whitespace issues. The keyword `Get Expected Alarms List` was changed to `Get Network Interface Alarms List` indicating a refinement in how expected alarms are obtained.

The final revision (8:39:20 AM) introduced a key change: the addition of a new test case, `Verify Giid Alarm Is Shelved`, and the modification of the `Verify Interface Category Shelf` test case's teardown to include this new verification.  This indicates a shift in testing to include GIID (Global Interface ID) alarms specifically. The `Verify Admin Down Alarm Is Shelved` keyword was replaced with `Verify Giid Alarm Is Shelved`  in this last update, showing a focus shift from testing Admin Down alarms to GIID alarms.  The overall structure and library dependencies remained consistent throughout all revisions.  The `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` tags suggest these tests are part of a nightly build and testing process.
