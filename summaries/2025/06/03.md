# Activity Summary for 6/3/2025

## 8:43:02 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmShelving.robot` underwent several revisions on June 3rd, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be refining the alarm shelving functionality.

The initial version (8:30:52 AM) contained a comprehensive set of test cases (`Verify Router Name Shelf`, `Verify Router Name Regex Shelf`, etc.) designed to verify alarm shelving based on various criteria (router name, node name, regex matching, category, severity, and message).  A commented-out section suggests future tests for resource-based shelving. The suite uses numerous Robot Framework libraries for tasks like SSH, Linux system interaction, and T128 configuration.

Subsequent updates (8:36:42 AM and 8:36:50 AM) show no significant code alterations.  The changes were minimal, likely addressing minor formatting or whitespace issues. The keyword `Get Expected Alarms List` was changed to `Get Network Interface Alarms List` indicating a refinement in how expected alarms are obtained.

The final revision (8:39:20 AM) introduced a key change: the addition of a new test case, `Verify Giid Alarm Is Shelved`, and the modification of the `Verify Interface Category Shelf` test case's teardown to include this new verification.  This indicates a shift in testing to include GIID (Global Interface ID) alarms specifically. The `Verify Admin Down Alarm Is Shelved` keyword was replaced with `Verify Giid Alarm Is Shelved`  in this last update, showing a focus shift from testing Admin Down alarms to GIID alarms.  The overall structure and library dependencies remained consistent throughout all revisions.  The `nightly_stable` and `nightly_stable_rhel` tags suggest these tests are part of a nightly build and testing process.


## 9:43:02 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmShelving.robot` underwent several revisions on June 3rd, 2025.  The primary focus is testing alarm shelving functionality on an HA router.  Multiple test cases verify shelving based on various criteria: router name, router name regex, node name, node name regex, category (network-interface, interface), severity (info), message regex, and match type (any, all).  Each test case follows a consistent pattern: setting variables, adding an alarm shelf using `Add Alarm Shelf`, verifying the alarm is shelved (`Verify Admin Down Alarm Is Shelved` or `Verify Giid Alarm Is Shelved`), deleting the shelf using `Delete Alarm Shelf`, and then verifying the alarm is no longer shelved.

A commented-out section suggests a planned test case for resource-based shelving that was not enabled at the time of these commits (likely due to issue I95-56849).  The keywords section shows extensive use of T128 configuration (`Get T128 Connection`, `Configure T128 On`, `Close T128 Connection`) for managing network interfaces and inducing/clearing alarms.  The `Add Alarm Shelf` and `Delete Alarm Shelf` keywords utilize API calls (`Execute Sudo API Request`) to interact with a system for managing alarm shelving.  There are multiple revisions refining the test suite and improving the keyword definitions.  The final versions around 9:39 AM show a cleaned-up version with the keyword definitions fully fleshed out.  The changes between 9:14 AM and 9:39 AM are primarily the addition of comprehensive keyword definitions for actions like adding, deleting, and managing alarm shelves through API requests and T128 configuration.  The change between 9:21:02 AM and 9:21:38 AM focuses on a small modification to the `Teardown` section of the `Verify Interface Category Shelf` test case, removing unnecessary `Network ${netintf}` from the teardown keyword call.


## 10:43:01 AM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmShelving.robot` underwent several revisions on June 3rd, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be around testing alarm shelving functionality.

The first revision (9:59:14 AM) establishes the test suite, defining resources, libraries (including `AlarmHandlerLib`, `LinuxLib`, and `T128`), variables (`KNI_INTF_NAME`, `USE_LEGACY_PARAMS`, `USE_TOP_ALARM_ENDPOINT`), and test cases (`Verify Interface Category Shelf`). The test cases focus on verifying alarm shelving and unshelving behaviors for both interface admin-down and Giid alarms, using keywords like `Add Alarm Shelf` and `Delete Alarm Shelf`.  Keywords also manage network connectivity, DUT configurations using T128, and alarm verification via API calls.


Subsequent revisions (10:33:33 AM and 10:35:22 AM) show minor modifications. The most notable change is within the `Get Giid Alarms List` keyword.  The initial version, present in the first revision, seemingly lacks a specific mechanism for obtaining Giid alarms. In the final revision (10:35:22 AM), the `Get Giid Alarms List` keyword is updated.  The structure remains largely the same, indicating a refinement or correction of alarm retrieval logic rather than a fundamental change to test functionality. This revision also includes a more detailed expected alarm message within `Get Giid Alarms List` related to DHCP address resolution. The repeated structure and general content of the file remained largely consistent across revisions, suggesting iterative refinement and bug fixing rather than a complete restructuring.


## 12:43:01 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `AlarmShelving.robot` (last updated 6/3/2025, 11:54:42 AM) verifies alarm shelving functionality on an HA router.  It uses numerous resource and library files for test setup and execution, including common audit, testbed, alarm handling, and system libraries.  The test suite focuses on verifying alarm shelving for both interface and Giid (likely referring to Global Interface Identifier) alarms.

The `Verify Interface Category Shelf` test case uses a series of keywords to:

1. Set up the test environment, including establishing connections and configuring a KNI interface.
2. Cause an administrative down alarm.
3. Verify that the alarm is and is not shelved (before and after shelving).
4. Cause a Giid alarm.
5. Verify that the Giid alarm is and is not shelved (before and after shelving).


Keywords like `Add Alarm Shelf`, `Delete Alarm Shelf`, `Verify Admin Down Alarm Is Shelved/Not Shelved`, `Verify Giid Alarm Is Shelved/Not Shelved` handle the core alarm manipulation and verification logic, interacting with the system via API requests (`Execute Sudo API Request`).  These keywords use JSON data to interact with the `/api/config/edit` and `/api/config/commit` endpoints for managing alarm shelving.  The suite utilizes T128 connections (`Get T128 Connection`, `Configure T128 On`, `Close T128 Connection`) for interacting with DUTs.  Significant timeouts (`Wait Until Keyword Succeeds 3m 30s`) are implemented to ensure stability during asynchronous operations.  The tests employ helper keywords to manage network connectivity and verify the presence or absence of specific alarms, using lists and dictionaries for data manipulation.  The variables `${USE_LEGACY_PARAMS}` and `${USE_TOP_ALARM_ENDPOINT}` suggest the possibility of using alternative configurations or endpoints.


## 1:43:02 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmShelving.robot` underwent two revisions on June 3rd, 2025, with minimal changes between the 12:57:04 PM and 12:57:23 PM commits.  Both versions are focused on testing alarm shelving functionality on an HA router.

The code uses several resources (`resources/AuditCommon.robot`, `resources/TestbedStore.robot`, `resources/AlarmCommon.robot`, `variable_files/BaseSuiteVariables.robot`) and libraries (`../System/User.py`, `libraries/InitRobot/InitRobot.py`, `libraries/AlarmHandlerLib.py`, `libraries/LinuxLib.py`, `libraries/NodeConnectivity.py`, `libraries/SSHLib.py`, `libraries/SystemRegistry.py`, `libraries/SystemTunnels.py`, `libraries/T128.py`) indicating a complex test environment and extensive use of external modules.

The core functionality involves the `Verify Interface Category Shelf` test case, which tests the shelving and unshelving of alarms, specifically "Admin Down" and "Giid" alarms, on a specified interface (`kniTest`).  This involves manipulating alarms through API calls (`/api/config/edit`, `/api/config/commit`) using JSON payloads.  The test uses keywords like `Add Alarm Shelf`, `Delete Alarm Shelf`, `Verify Admin Down Alarm Is Shelved`, `Verify Giid Alarm Is Shelved`, etc.  These keywords likely interact with the router's configuration to trigger and manage alarms and their shelving state.  The tests heavily rely on manipulating network interfaces and verifying connectivity using the `T128` library which suggests a 128T network device is involved. The use of  `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds` indicates error handling and retry mechanisms.  The `Get Network Interface Alarms List` and `Get Giid Alarms List` keywords are used to check the state of the alarms post actions.

No significant structural changes are observed between the two timestamps; the difference is probably minor updates or corrections to existing code.


## 2:43:02 PM
The Robot Framework test suite `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/robot/tests/suites/system/Alarm/AlarmShelving.robot` underwent several revisions on June 3rd, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes was expanding the test cases to cover various alarm shelving scenarios.

Initially, the suite focused on verifying alarm shelving for interface categories.  Later revisions added tests for shelving based on router name, router name using regular expressions, node name, node name using regular expressions, category, severity, message using regular expressions, and different match types ("any" and "all"). A test for resource-based shelving was commented out, possibly pending resolution of issue I95-56849.

Throughout the revisions, the core structure remained consistent, utilizing resources like `AuditCommon.robot`, `TestbedStore.robot`, `AlarmCommon.robot`, and `variable_files/BaseSuiteVariables.robot`.  Libraries like `AlarmHandlerLib.py`, `LinuxLib.py`, and `T128.py` were consistently used to interact with the system and manipulate alarms.

The timestamped changes show a pattern of iterative development:  initial implementation (2:07:59 PM), minor textual corrections in comments related to DHCP alarm clearing (2:09:05 PM and 2:09:20 PM), and finally the major expansion of test cases to include various shelving criteria (2:28:33 PM).  The time intervals between commits suggest focused bursts of development.  The consistent use of keywords like `Add Alarm Shelf` and `Delete Alarm Shelf` indicates a structured approach to testing the alarm shelving functionality.  A recurring element is the use of the `kniTest` interface and the `DUT2_ROUTER` and `DUT2_NODE_NAME` variables, suggesting that the testing is centered around a specific network interface and device configuration.  The "hack" to address issue I95-61411 (related to DHCP alarm clearing) was refined in wording across multiple commits.
