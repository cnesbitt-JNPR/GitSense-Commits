# Activity Summary for 6/4/2025

## 11:31:23 AM
The log shows a single update to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file at 6/4/2025, 11:08:27 AM.  This update added or modified SSH host keys for several IP addresses and hostnames.  The entries include various key types: `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`.  Multiple entries exist for some IP addresses, indicating multiple ports or services.  The IP addresses predominantly fall within the 10.27.x.x private network range.  One hostname, `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, is also present.  A recurring pattern is the presence of multiple key types for many of the listed IP addresses.


## 2:34:06 PM
The log shows development activity focused on the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor` directory within a C++ project.

At 1:36:26 PM,  `CMakeLists.txt` was updated, adding a substantial number of source files to the `NodeMonitor` library.  This suggests a significant build configuration change, incorporating various monitoring components (e.g., `AuditdInterfaceManager`, `ChassisMonitor`, `CpuDataRetriever`). The list of libraries linked indicates a dependency on several internal modules.

Between 1:37:01 PM and 1:48:06 PM,  `ChassisMonitor.hpp` underwent iterative changes. Initially, it was a simple class definition.  Subsequent edits added `InitializeChassisStats()` and `UpdateChassisStats()` methods, suggesting the implementation of chassis status monitoring.  Finally, a `handleChassisHeartbeat` method was introduced, indicating the addition of a heartbeat handling mechanism, likely via an HTTP interface.  The comments and frequent revisions suggest refinement of the class's functionality and interface.  The copyright notice indicates that this code is likely owned by Juniper Networks.
