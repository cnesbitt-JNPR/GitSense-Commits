# Activity Summary for 6/4/2025

## 11:31:23 AM
The log shows a single update to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file at 6/4/2025, 11:08:27 AM.  This update added or modified SSH host keys for several IP addresses and hostnames.  The entries include various key types: `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`.  Multiple entries exist for some IP addresses, indicating multiple ports or services.  The IP addresses predominantly fall within the 10.27.x.x private network range.  One hostname, `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, is also present.  A recurring pattern is the presence of multiple key types for many of the listed IP addresses.


## 2:34:06 PM
The log shows development activity focused on the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor` directory within a C++ project.

At 1:36:26 PM,  `CMakeLists.txt` was updated, adding a substantial number of source files to the `NodeMonitor` library.  This suggests a significant build configuration change, incorporating various monitoring components (e.g., `AuditdInterfaceManager`, `ChassisMonitor`, `CpuDataRetriever`). The list of libraries linked indicates a dependency on several internal modules.

Between 1:37:01 PM and 1:48:06 PM,  `ChassisMonitor.hpp` underwent iterative changes. Initially, it was a simple class definition.  Subsequent edits added `InitializeChassisStats()` and `UpdateChassisStats()` methods, suggesting the implementation of chassis status monitoring.  Finally, a `handleChassisHeartbeat` method was introduced, indicating the addition of a heartbeat handling mechanism, likely via an HTTP interface.  The comments and frequent revisions suggest refinement of the class's functionality and interface.  The copyright notice indicates that this code is likely owned by Juniper Networks.


## 3:34:06 PM
The log shows development of a `ChassisMonitor` class within a NodeMonitor application.  The `ChassisMonitor.hpp` header file underwent several revisions between 3:20 PM and 3:22 PM on June 4th, 2025.  These revisions primarily involved adding include statements: `<state/StateObjects.hpp>` and `<dolly/dynamic.h>`.  The class declaration itself remained largely unchanged, consistently defining a constructor, destructor, and methods for initializing and updating chassis statistics, as well as handling heartbeats.

At 3:22 PM, the corresponding `.cpp` file (`ChassisMonitor.cpp`) was created, providing initial (commented-out) implementations for the methods declared in the header.  A significant change occurred at 3:23 PM in  `ChassisMonitor.hpp`, where  `nodeName` and `stateObjects` were added as private members of the `ChassisMonitor` class.  The `ChassisMonitor.cpp` file was updated accordingly at 3:23 PM, initializing these members in the constructor.  Finally, at 3:27 PM, the `handleChassisHeartbeat` function in `ChassisMonitor.cpp` received a functional implementation, returning a JSON response using the `dolly::dynamic` library.  The implementation is currently a placeholder, returning a "placeholder" status.


## 4:34:17 PM
The log shows several code changes across `NodeMonitor.cpp`, `NodeMonitor.hpp`, and `ChassisMonitor.cpp`, `ChassisMonitor.hpp` files between 3:45 PM and 4:32 PM on June 4, 2025.  The majority of changes center around the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor` directory.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp` underwent multiple revisions.  Early revisions focused on the implementation of methods for updating CPU, memory, and disk utilization, using the `dolly::dynamic` library for data representation.  Later revisions (after 3:54 PM) added a `ChassisMonitor`  to the `NodeMonitor` class, integrating chassis status updates into the `updateSecondStats` method.  A new HTTP route `/api/v1/chassis/heartbeat` was added to handle chassis heartbeats. The final change at 4:27 PM and 4:32 PM  is likely associated with refactoring and bug fixes, as it includes many code changes in many parts of the class, including further integration with `ChassisMonitor` and no major new features added.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.hpp` also saw multiple updates, mostly mirroring the changes in the `.cpp` file. The most significant change was the modification of `pChassisMonitor`'s type from `ChassisMonitorPtr` (likely a shared pointer) to `std::unique_ptr<node_monitor::chassis::ChassisMonitor>` between 4:28 PM and 4:32 PM. This change implies a shift in ownership management of the `ChassisMonitor` instance.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.hpp`  were initially created around 3:46 PM with placeholder implementations for `InitializeChassisStats`, `UpdateChassisStats`, and `handleChassisHeartbeat`.  No substantial functional changes were made to this file after the initial creation.  The code suggests the `ChassisMonitor` class is designed to monitor chassis-specific metrics and provide a heartbeat endpoint.


In summary, the code evolution shows a phased approach: initially establishing core monitoring functionality for CPU, memory, and disk, followed by integration of a new `ChassisMonitor` class, culminating in the addition of the chassis heartbeat HTTP endpoint and likely refactoring changes. The consistent use of `dolly::dynamic` and the pattern of updating system state suggests a focus on structured data and state management.


## 5:34:08 PM
The log shows development activity on June 4th, 2025, focused on the `NodeMonitor` application.  The `ChassisMonitor.cpp` file underwent updates at 4:37:04 PM and 4:53:43 PM,  both times containing placeholder code for `InitializeChassisStats()`, `UpdateChassisStats()`, and the `handleChassisHeartbeat()` function.  These placeholders suggest the chassis monitoring functionality is under development.

Between 4:43:01 PM and 4:47:22 PM,  the `TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp` file was modified several times. Initially, it was a basic test harness class inheriting from `ChassisMonitor`.  Subsequent changes added  `TODO` comments indicating the need for stubs to intercept calls to `ChassisManager` and inject responses for testing purposes.  Finally, the namespace was corrected from `password_scanner_test` to `chassis_monitor_test` and a closing namespace brace was added.

The `TestHarnessNodeMonitor.hpp` file was updated twice, at 4:47:08 PM and 4:47:22 PM. These changes involved no code alteration; they simply reflect multiple saves of the same file.  This file contains a comprehensive test harness for `NodeMonitor`, including setup for `PasswordSecurityScanner` and `ChassisMonitor` test harnesses, and detailed test methods for CPU, memory, and disk utilization.  The copyright year was changed from 2017 to 2025, indicating a possible update.

An empty `Untitled-1` file was created twice, at 4:41:47 PM and 4:54:31 PM, suggesting possibly temporary or discarded files.

Finally, `ChassisMonitorTest.cpp` was updated twice (4:55:13 PM and 4:55:27 PM) with a placeholder comment suggesting further test implementation is needed.
