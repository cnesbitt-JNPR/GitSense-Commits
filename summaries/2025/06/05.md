# Activity Summary for 6/5/2025

## 9:34:08 AM
The log shows development of a `ChassisMonitor` class within a NodeMonitor application.  The key changes are:

* **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp`**: This file underwent two revisions on June 5th, 2025. The first revision (9:25:53 AM) was a stub,  while the second (9:27:53 AM) introduced a test setup using `t128::NameId` and `pattern::StackSafe<state::Objects>` to initialize `ChassisMonitor` within the test suite. This indicates the start of unit testing.

* **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.hpp`**: This header file was updated at 9:31:33 AM, defining the `ChassisMonitor` class.  It includes methods for initializing and updating chassis statistics, handling heartbeats (via an HTTP endpoint), and importantly,  it uses `t128::NameId` and `state::Objects` as member variables.  The class also explicitly deletes copy and move constructors/assignment operators, suggesting a non-copyable/movable design.

* **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`**: This source file, updated at 9:31:42 AM, provides the implementation for `ChassisMonitor`. The methods are largely stubs marked with "todo" comments, indicating ongoing development. The `handleChassisHeartbeat` function currently returns a placeholder JSON response.  This indicates that the core functionality is yet to be fully implemented.

In summary, the log depicts the initial stages of implementing and testing the `ChassisMonitor` class.  The class appears to be responsible for monitoring chassis-related information and exposing this data via an HTTP interface. The development process involved creating test cases and then a basic class implementation with placeholder functions.  The use of `t128::NameId` suggests a node identification system and the usage of `state::Objects` points to interaction with a larger state management system within the application.


## 10:34:07 AM
The log shows development of a `ChassisMonitor` class within a NodeMonitor application.  The primary focus is on chassis temperature monitoring.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp` (6/5/2025, 9:38:46 AM) defines a test harness for `ChassisMonitor`, outlining several TODOs for stubbing interactions with a `ChassisManager` and the application's state.  This suggests a test-driven development approach.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` underwent multiple revisions.  The initial versions (6/5/2025, 9:47:22 AM and 9:47:27 AM) contain numerous TODO comments indicating incomplete implementation of functions related to fetching and writing temperature thresholds and stats, and handling heartbeats.  The final version (6/5/2025, 10:15:30 AM) shows significant progress.  `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` and `fetchTemperaturesFromChassis` now return hardcoded temperature values (thresholds and current temperatures respectively).  New functions `writeTemperaturesToState` and `fetchTemperaturesFromChassis` were added to manage the current temperature readings.  The `handleChassisHeartbeat` function remains a placeholder.  This demonstrates iterative development, starting with placeholders and progressively adding functionality.  The consistent use of `dolly::dynamic` suggests a reliance on a dynamic data structure library.  The code also uses `http::FutureResponse` indicating an asynchronous HTTP handling mechanism.


## 11:34:07 AM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`.  The file is part of a chassis monitoring system, likely for network devices.

The main focus of the changes is on fetching and writing chassis temperature thresholds and readings to a state object.  The initial version (10:46:54 AM) included placeholder functions for fetching and writing these values, along with logging using `DebugLog(PLAT)`.

A subsequent update (10:49:06 AM) added logging within `writeTemperatureThresholdsToState`, indicating the thresholds being written.  This function also contains commented-out code suggesting an attempt to integrate with a `stateObjects` system, potentially for persistent storage of this data.

The final update (11:32:45 AM) involved renaming the temperature sensor identifiers from "device1", "device2", "device3" to "sensor1", "sensor2", "sensor3" in both `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` and `fetchTemperaturesFromChassis` functions.  The rest of the code remains largely unchanged, with many functions still marked as "todo".  The `handleChassisHeartbeat` function also remains a placeholder.  Throughout the updates, the temperature thresholds remain statically defined within the functions, suggesting the actual fetching mechanism from the ChassisManager is not yet implemented.


## 12:34:08 PM
The code changes primarily focus on the `ChassisMonitor` class, responsible for monitoring chassis temperature and other related statistics.  Several `.cpp` and `.hpp` files were modified between 11:41 AM and 11:57 AM on June 5th, 2025.

The `ChassisMonitor.cpp` file underwent multiple revisions.  Initial versions contained placeholder functions (`// todo`) for fetching and writing temperature thresholds and actual temperatures to a state object.  The hardcoded return values in `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` and `fetchTemperaturesFromChassis` suggest these functions were initially implemented with dummy data (thresholds at 70, 75, 80 and temperatures at 25, 30, 35 respectively for "sensor1", "sensor2", and "sensor3").  A comment was added in `UpdateChassisStats()` to note that fan condition changes should trigger a refetch of temperature thresholds.  A `handleChassisHeartbeat` function was also added to handle HTTP heartbeats, initially returning a placeholder "status".  The minor change between the first two commits to `ChassisMonitor.cpp`  simply corrects a typo ("chenges" to "changes") in a comment.


The `ChassisMonitor.hpp` file was updated to include the class definition for `ChassisMonitor`, declaring its methods as virtual to allow for overriding in derived classes.  The constructor is made private and move and copy semantics are deleted.

A new file, `TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp`, was introduced, creating a test harness class inheriting from `ChassisMonitor`.  This class includes stub methods and members for intercepting calls to the `ChassisManager`, writes to the state object, and reads for the heartbeat.  This indicates a testing framework is being set up.  The test harness uses a `SafeKey`, suggesting a secure key mechanism is in use elsewhere in the application.

Overall, the changes reflect the development and testing phases of the `ChassisMonitor` component. The use of `dolly::dynamic` suggests a dynamic JSON-like data structure is used for data exchange.  The consistent use of comments marked with "// todo" indicates ongoing development and areas requiring further implementation.


## 1:34:07 PM
The log shows iterative development of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp`.  The file defines a `TestHarnessChassisMonitor` class, likely for testing purposes, inheriting from `ChassisMonitor`.

The initial version (1:32:12 PM) declares the class with member functions to set and get dummy temperature thresholds and temperatures, but these functions lack implementations.  The code also contains several TODO comments indicating the need for stubs to intercept calls to `ChassisManager` and interactions with the state.

A minor update at 1:32:49 PM adds a `getTemperatures()` function implementation.

A significant change at 1:33:38 PM provides implementations for `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis()` and `writeTemperatureThresholdsToState()`. `writeTemperatureThresholdsToState()` now includes a debug log statement using `dolly::toJson()`.

The final version (1:34:02 PM) completes the implementation by adding implementations for  `fetchTemperaturesFromChassis()` and `writeTemperaturesToState()`.  The debug log statement from the previous version has been removed.

Throughout the process, the TODO comments remain, suggesting further development is needed to fully implement the test harness. The consistent use of `dolly::dynamic` indicates a reliance on a dynamic data structure library.  The changes follow a pattern of incrementally adding functionality to the test harness class, starting with declarations and progressing to full implementations of methods.


## 2:34:10 PM
The log shows a series of code changes related to the development and testing of a `NodeMonitor` application, specifically focusing on the `ChassisMonitor` component.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp`**:  This header file defines a test harness (`TestHarnessChassisMonitor`) for the `ChassisMonitor` class.  It was modified twice, with minor changes between the two commits (6/5/2025, 1:34:54 PM and 6/5/2025, 1:35:20 PM). The key change was the removal of some TODO comments related to stubbing interactions with the `ChassisManager` and `State` components. The class includes methods to set and retrieve dummy temperature thresholds and temperatures, overriding methods in the parent class to control test behavior.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`**: This source file contains the implementation of the `ChassisMonitor` class. Two nearly identical commits were made (6/5/2025, 1:44:52 PM and 6/5/2025, 1:45:36 PM), with the only apparent difference being a minor word change in a comment ("temperature thresholds" vs "temperature"). The file includes methods to fetch and write temperature thresholds and temperatures to/from a state, as well as a placeholder for a chassis heartbeat handler.  The code uses `dolly::dynamic` for handling data structures.  The methods contain several TODO comments indicating incomplete functionality.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp`**: This file contains unit tests for the `ChassisMonitor` class. Several commits show the progressive development of the tests (between 1:48:18 PM and 1:56:47 PM). Initially, it declared tests but with empty implementations. Then, test data (`testTemperatureThresholds`, `testTemperatures`) were added.  Crucially, the test harness `chassis_monitor_test::TestHarnessChassisMonitor` was integrated into the tests, allowing for control over the mocked data.  By 1:56:47 PM, the `testInitializeChassisStats` and `testUpdateChassisStats` tests had been implemented using the harness and assertions added for verification.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/CMakeLists.txt`**: This file manages the build process for the unit tests. Two commits (6/5/2025, 1:58:21 PM and 6/5/2025, 1:59:26 PM) show a reduction in linked libraries for the `chassisMonitorTest` target. The initial commit included various 128T libraries and `dolly`, while the second commit removed the 128T libraries except for `128T_nodeMonitor` and kept only `dolly`.  This suggests a refactoring or simplification of dependencies.  The file also lists other unit tests for different components within the `NodeMonitor` application.


In summary, the code changes reflect the iterative development of unit tests for the `ChassisMonitor` component. The use of a dedicated test harness allowed for isolated testing and controlled input/output.  Dependency management in the CMakeLists.txt was also refined.  The timestamps indicate focused work within a short timeframe.  Many TODO comments suggest ongoing development and potential future feature additions.


## 3:34:09 PM
The log shows development work on a `ChassisMonitor` component within a NodeMonitor application.  The most significant changes happened between 3:22 PM and 3:33 PM on June 5th, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/CMakeLists.txt`: This file underwent two nearly identical revisions within a minute of each other (2:51 PM and 2:52 PM).  The changes appear minor, possibly related to removing some library dependencies from the `chassisMonitorTest`.  Specifically, `128T_environment_config` and `128T_persistentData` were removed, among others.  The file defines several test targets (`add_test_128`) for various components of the NodeMonitor, consistently using a set of common libraries (`128T_app`, `128T_gMockMain`, `128T_util`, etc.).  It also configures several test files (`configure_file`).

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`:  This file details the implementation of the `ChassisMonitor` class. Multiple revisions occurred between 3:22 PM and 3:31 PM.  The core functionality involves fetching and writing chassis temperature thresholds and temperatures to a state object.  The `handleChassisHeartbeat` function is stubbed out.  Significant changes include the removal of the `http::Request` parameter from `handleChassisHeartbeat` function, simplifying its signature.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp`: This file contains unit tests for the `ChassisMonitor` class.  Minor revisions were made between 3:23 PM and 3:33 PM, likely reflecting changes made in the corresponding `.cpp` file. These modifications involved no functional changes to the test cases themselves.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.hpp`: The header file for `ChassisMonitor` was updated at 3:31 PM and 3:33 PM.  The updates seem to be related to adding `#include <http/HTTPHelpers.hpp>`, suggesting the introduction or modification of HTTP-related functionality.  The class declaration itself remained largely unchanged, retaining its methods for initializing and updating chassis stats, and handling heartbeats.


The overall pattern shows iterative development on the `ChassisMonitor`, with unit tests closely following the implementation changes. The use of `dolly::dynamic` suggests a dynamic JSON-like data structure is being used for data representation.  The `128T_` prefix on many libraries suggests a common internal naming convention.  The `// todo` comments indicate ongoing development and areas requiring further implementation.


## 4:34:12 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the NodeMonitor application and its associated tests between 3:35 PM and 4:33 PM on June 5th, 2025.  The primary focus appears to be on the `ChassisMonitor` component.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp`:  This file underwent multiple revisions within a short time frame (3:35 PM - 3:58 PM). The changes primarily involved correcting the namespace declaration from `node_monitor_test` to `chassis_monitor_test` and minor cleanup, removing an extraneous closing brace and refining the `TestHarnessChassisMonitor` usage within the test class.  The final change at 3:58 PM updated the type of `testTemperatureThresholds` and `testTemperatures` from `dolly::dynamic::object` to simply `dolly::dynamic`. Another small change at 4:00 PM corrected the class declaration to include a semicolon, and another change at 4:03 PM corrected the type of `pChassisMonitor` in the test class.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp`: A single modification occurred at 3:55 PM. This revision introduced a test harness class (`TestHarnessChassisMonitor`) for the `ChassisMonitor`, providing dummy implementations of methods that interact with the chassis hardware and state, simplifying testing.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.hpp`: A single update at 3:56 PM defined the `ChassisMonitor` class, outlining its core functionalities including `InitializeChassisStats`, `UpdateChassisStats`, and `handleChassisHeartbeat`, indicating the beginning of implementation for monitoring chassis hardware.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`: This file was updated twice (4:02 PM and 4:33 PM).  The initial update provided basic skeletal implementations for the methods declared in the header, utilizing placeholder data. The second update at 4:33 PM contained a small correction in the `UpdateChassisStats` function: changing `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` to `fetchTemperaturesFromChassis`.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp`:  A significant change was made to this file at 3:43 PM, adding extensive functionality related to CPU, memory, and disk utilization monitoring. The code uses the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON-like object manipulation and includes extensive logging.  Another change at 3:51 PM appears to be a no-op.  The modifications suggest a comprehensive overhaul of the system monitoring capabilities, adding detailed metrics collection and reporting.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.hpp`:  This file was updated twice (4:05 PM and 4:07 PM).  The changes primarily involved adding header files required for several components and services associated with the NodeMonitor. The updates reflect the addition of features such as audit event collection, LDAP retrieval, password security scanning, and synchronized directory publishing, introduced in the corresponding `.cpp` file updates. The second change appears to be a no-op.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/CMakeLists.txt`: This file was updated three times (4:09 PM, 4:09 PM, and 4:14 PM), primarily to add the `chassisMonitorTest` to the list of tests.  A later change added `128T_zkTestingSupport` to the dependencies for `chassisMonitorTest`.  These changes reflect the addition of the new `ChassisMonitor` component and its associated tests.

In summary, the code changes represent a substantial enhancement of the NodeMonitor application, adding sophisticated chassis monitoring, along with improved testing infrastructure.  The development process involved iterative refinements and debugging within a short timeframe.
