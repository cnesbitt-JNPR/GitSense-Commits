# Activity Summary for 6/5/2025

## 9:34:08 AM
The log shows development of a `ChassisMonitor` class within a NodeMonitor application.  The key changes are:

* **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp`**: This file underwent two revisions on June 5th, 2025. The first revision (9:25:53 AM) was a stub,  while the second (9:27:53 AM) introduced a test setup using `t128::NameId` and `pattern::StackSafe<state::Objects>` to initialize `ChassisMonitor` within the test suite. This indicates the start of unit testing.

* **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.hpp`**: This header file was updated at 9:31:33 AM, defining the `ChassisMonitor` class.  It includes methods for initializing and updating chassis statistics, handling heartbeats (via an HTTP endpoint), and importantly,  it uses `t128::NameId` and `state::Objects` as member variables.  The class also explicitly deletes copy and move constructors/assignment operators, suggesting a non-copyable/movable design.

* **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`**: This source file, updated at 9:31:42 AM, provides the implementation for `ChassisMonitor`. The methods are largely stubs marked with "todo" comments, indicating ongoing development. The `handleChassisHeartbeat` function currently returns a placeholder JSON response.  This indicates that the core functionality is yet to be fully implemented.

In summary, the log depicts the initial stages of implementing and testing the `ChassisMonitor` class.  The class appears to be responsible for monitoring chassis-related information and exposing this data via an HTTP interface. The development process involved creating test cases and then a basic class implementation with placeholder functions.  The use of `t128::NameId` suggests a node identification system and the usage of `state::Objects` points to interaction with a larger state management system within the application.
