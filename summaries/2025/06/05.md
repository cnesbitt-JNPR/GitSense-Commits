# Activity Summary for 6/5/2025

## 9:34:08 AM
The log shows development of a `ChassisMonitor` class within a NodeMonitor application.  The key changes are:

* **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp`**: This file underwent two revisions on June 5th, 2025. The first revision (9:25:53 AM) was a stub,  while the second (9:27:53 AM) introduced a test setup using `t128::NameId` and `pattern::StackSafe<state::Objects>` to initialize `ChassisMonitor` within the test suite. This indicates the start of unit testing.

* **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.hpp`**: This header file was updated at 9:31:33 AM, defining the `ChassisMonitor` class.  It includes methods for initializing and updating chassis statistics, handling heartbeats (via an HTTP endpoint), and importantly,  it uses `t128::NameId` and `state::Objects` as member variables.  The class also explicitly deletes copy and move constructors/assignment operators, suggesting a non-copyable/movable design.

* **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`**: This source file, updated at 9:31:42 AM, provides the implementation for `ChassisMonitor`. The methods are largely stubs marked with "todo" comments, indicating ongoing development. The `handleChassisHeartbeat` function currently returns a placeholder JSON response.  This indicates that the core functionality is yet to be fully implemented.

In summary, the log depicts the initial stages of implementing and testing the `ChassisMonitor` class.  The class appears to be responsible for monitoring chassis-related information and exposing this data via an HTTP interface. The development process involved creating test cases and then a basic class implementation with placeholder functions.  The use of `t128::NameId` suggests a node identification system and the usage of `state::Objects` points to interaction with a larger state management system within the application.


## 10:34:07 AM
The log shows development of a `ChassisMonitor` class within a NodeMonitor application.  The primary focus is on chassis temperature monitoring.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp` (6/5/2025, 9:38:46 AM) defines a test harness for `ChassisMonitor`, outlining several TODOs for stubbing interactions with a `ChassisManager` and the application's state.  This suggests a test-driven development approach.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` underwent multiple revisions.  The initial versions (6/5/2025, 9:47:22 AM and 9:47:27 AM) contain numerous TODO comments indicating incomplete implementation of functions related to fetching and writing temperature thresholds and stats, and handling heartbeats.  The final version (6/5/2025, 10:15:30 AM) shows significant progress.  `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` and `fetchTemperaturesFromChassis` now return hardcoded temperature values (thresholds and current temperatures respectively).  New functions `writeTemperaturesToState` and `fetchTemperaturesFromChassis` were added to manage the current temperature readings.  The `handleChassisHeartbeat` function remains a placeholder.  This demonstrates iterative development, starting with placeholders and progressively adding functionality.  The consistent use of `dolly::dynamic` suggests a reliance on a dynamic data structure library.  The code also uses `http::FutureResponse` indicating an asynchronous HTTP handling mechanism.


## 11:34:07 AM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`.  The file is part of a chassis monitoring system, likely for network devices.

The main focus of the changes is on fetching and writing chassis temperature thresholds and readings to a state object.  The initial version (10:46:54 AM) included placeholder functions for fetching and writing these values, along with logging using `DebugLog(PLAT)`.

A subsequent update (10:49:06 AM) added logging within `writeTemperatureThresholdsToState`, indicating the thresholds being written.  This function also contains commented-out code suggesting an attempt to integrate with a `stateObjects` system, potentially for persistent storage of this data.

The final update (11:32:45 AM) involved renaming the temperature sensor identifiers from "device1", "device2", "device3" to "sensor1", "sensor2", "sensor3" in both `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` and `fetchTemperaturesFromChassis` functions.  The rest of the code remains largely unchanged, with many functions still marked as "todo".  The `handleChassisHeartbeat` function also remains a placeholder.  Throughout the updates, the temperature thresholds remain statically defined within the functions, suggesting the actual fetching mechanism from the ChassisManager is not yet implemented.


## 12:34:08 PM
The code changes primarily focus on the `ChassisMonitor` class, responsible for monitoring chassis temperature and other related statistics.  Several `.cpp` and `.hpp` files were modified between 11:41 AM and 11:57 AM on June 5th, 2025.

The `ChassisMonitor.cpp` file underwent multiple revisions.  Initial versions contained placeholder functions (`// todo`) for fetching and writing temperature thresholds and actual temperatures to a state object.  The hardcoded return values in `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` and `fetchTemperaturesFromChassis` suggest these functions were initially implemented with dummy data (thresholds at 70, 75, 80 and temperatures at 25, 30, 35 respectively for "sensor1", "sensor2", and "sensor3").  A comment was added in `UpdateChassisStats()` to note that fan condition changes should trigger a refetch of temperature thresholds.  A `handleChassisHeartbeat` function was also added to handle HTTP heartbeats, initially returning a placeholder "status".  The minor change between the first two commits to `ChassisMonitor.cpp`  simply corrects a typo ("chenges" to "changes") in a comment.


The `ChassisMonitor.hpp` file was updated to include the class definition for `ChassisMonitor`, declaring its methods as virtual to allow for overriding in derived classes.  The constructor is made private and move and copy semantics are deleted.

A new file, `TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp`, was introduced, creating a test harness class inheriting from `ChassisMonitor`.  This class includes stub methods and members for intercepting calls to the `ChassisManager`, writes to the state object, and reads for the heartbeat.  This indicates a testing framework is being set up.  The test harness uses a `SafeKey`, suggesting a secure key mechanism is in use elsewhere in the application.

Overall, the changes reflect the development and testing phases of the `ChassisMonitor` component. The use of `dolly::dynamic` suggests a dynamic JSON-like data structure is used for data exchange.  The consistent use of comments marked with "// todo" indicates ongoing development and areas requiring further implementation.
