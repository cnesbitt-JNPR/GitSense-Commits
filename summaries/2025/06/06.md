# Activity Summary for 6/6/2025

## 2:31:37 PM
The log shows two revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp`, both on June 6th, 2025.  The second revision (2:31:13 PM) is a minor update to the `updateStats()` function.  The original log message "Updating Second Stats..." was changed to "Updating NodeMonitor Stats...".  The corresponding closing message was similarly updated.  No other code changes are present between the two revisions.  The file defines a `NodeMonitor` class responsible for monitoring system resources (CPU, memory, disk) and interacting with an HTTP server to expose these metrics.  It utilizes various libraries for tasks like logging, configuration, and data serialization (e.g., `dolly`, `stats`, `syslib`).  The `NodeMonitor` class includes methods for updating and retrieving utilization statistics for CPU, memory, and disk, along with NTP server status queries and other system checks.  The HTTP server endpoints include support for retrieving version information and PCI addresses.  The code also incorporates error handling and logging mechanisms.
