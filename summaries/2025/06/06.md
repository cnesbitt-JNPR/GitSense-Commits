# Activity Summary for 6/6/2025

## 2:31:37 PM
The log shows two revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp`, both on June 6th, 2025.  The second revision (2:31:13 PM) is a minor update to the `updateStats()` function.  The original log message "Updating Second Stats..." was changed to "Updating NodeMonitor Stats...".  The corresponding closing message was similarly updated.  No other code changes are present between the two revisions.  The file defines a `NodeMonitor` class responsible for monitoring system resources (CPU, memory, disk) and interacting with an HTTP server to expose these metrics.  It utilizes various libraries for tasks like logging, configuration, and data serialization (e.g., `dolly`, `stats`, `syslib`).  The `NodeMonitor` class includes methods for updating and retrieving utilization statistics for CPU, memory, and disk, along with NTP server status queries and other system checks.  The HTTP server endpoints include support for retrieving version information and PCI addresses.  The code also incorporates error handling and logging mechanisms.


## 3:31:39 PM
The log shows modifications to two files: `TestHarnessNodeMonitor.hpp` and `NodeMonitor.cpp`.  Both files relate to a NodeMonitor application, likely for system monitoring.

`TestHarnessNodeMonitor.hpp` (6/6/2025, 2:35:22 PM): This file contains a test harness for the `NodeMonitor` class.  It includes extensive mocking and test setup for CPU, memory, and disk utilization, using test-specific files (`/tmp/etc/shadow`, `/tmp/TestHarnessNodeMonitor.flag`, `test_cpuinfo`, `test_cpustat`).  The harness also incorporates test doubles for `PasswordSecurityScanner` and `ChassisMonitor`. The code heavily utilizes the `dolly` and `boost::filesystem` libraries.  Key aspects include methods for manipulating test data (e.g., `setCpuUtilization`, `createEmptyCpuStats`, `createPopulatedCpuStats`) and assertions to verify the worker queue functionality.


`NodeMonitor.cpp` (6/6/2025, 3:00:26 PM and 6/6/2025, 3:14:21 PM): This file contains the implementation of the `NodeMonitor` class.  There are two entries for this file, indicating at least one subsequent change. The code shows the logic for monitoring CPU, memory, and disk utilization, along with NTP server status.  It uses REST APIs (`/api/v1/...`) for exposing system information. It interacts with a `TankWriterInterface` (likely for metrics logging). The second update to this file (3:14:21 PM) added `initializeDiskInfo()` function, suggesting an enhancement to disk monitoring. The code shows extensive use of the `dolly` library for JSON handling and  `syslib` for system information retrieval.  The initialization of various components (`PasswordSecurityScanner`, `ChassisMonitor`, `AuditEventCollector`, `ResolvConfUpdater`, `AuditdInterfaceManager`) is spread across several functions.  There's also logging using `DebugLog` and `ErrorLog`.  The primary function `run()` sets up the HTTP server and starts the monitoring process.


In summary, the changes reflect the development and testing of a system monitoring application. The `TestHarnessNodeMonitor.hpp` file provides a thorough testing framework, while `NodeMonitor.cpp` implements the core monitoring functionalities and REST API endpoints.  The second update to `NodeMonitor.cpp` suggests ongoing development and potential refinement of the disk monitoring features.  The consistent use of specific libraries (dolly, boost::filesystem, syslib) and logging practices highlight a structured and well-documented codebase.
