# Activity Summary for 6/9/2025

## 12:18:25 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp` on June 9th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions: the code defines a `NodeMonitor` class responsible for monitoring system resources (CPU, memory, disk) and exposing this data via an HTTP API.  The class utilizes various other classes and libraries for tasks like data sampling, logging, and interaction with system calls.

The most significant change occurred between the first and third revisions (11:42:49 AM and 11:43:50 AM).  The `updateStats` method was modified to include a debug log statement: `"NodeMonitor::updateStats() called."`.  This suggests the addition of improved logging for debugging purposes.


No other substantial code changes are apparent between the revisions; the differences are minor and likely related to debugging or very minor refactoring.  The code consistently uses the `dolly` library for JSON manipulation and various Juniper Networks-specific libraries for system interactions and configuration.  The HTTP API endpoints remain unchanged across revisions.
