# Activity Summary for 6/9/2025

## 12:18:25 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp` on June 9th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions: the code defines a `NodeMonitor` class responsible for monitoring system resources (CPU, memory, disk) and exposing this data via an HTTP API.  The class utilizes various other classes and libraries for tasks like data sampling, logging, and interaction with system calls.

The most significant change occurred between the first and third revisions (11:42:49 AM and 11:43:50 AM).  The `updateStats` method was modified to include a debug log statement: `"NodeMonitor::updateStats() called."`.  This suggests the addition of improved logging for debugging purposes.


No other substantial code changes are apparent between the revisions; the differences are minor and likely related to debugging or very minor refactoring.  The code consistently uses the `dolly` library for JSON manipulation and various Juniper Networks-specific libraries for system interactions and configuration.  The HTTP API endpoints remain unchanged across revisions.


## 1:18:26 PM
The NodeMonitor.cpp file, last modified on 6/9/2025, 1:12:53 PM,  is a C++ implementation of a node monitoring service.  It heavily utilizes the Dolly library for JSON handling and asynchronous operations.  The code monitors CPU, memory, and disk utilization, NTP server status, and collects audit events.

Key updates include:

* **Resource Utilization Monitoring:**  The class extensively monitors and updates CPU, memory, and disk usage, sending this data to what appears to be a state object (`pNode->getSystem().setCpuUtilization(nodeValue);`, etc.).  The data is formatted into JSON using the Dolly library.

* **NTP Server Status:** The code queries and updates the NTP server status, setting an empty state if NTP is not configured.

* **Audit Event Handling:** It integrates with an `AuditEventCollector` to collect and batch audit events.  A `ResolvConfUpdater` is also used, suggesting management of DNS configuration.

* **HTTP API:** The `NodeMonitor` exposes an HTTP API (`/api/v1/...`) to retrieve system information such as version, PCI addresses, LDAP status, and to handle requests for restarting minions and chassis heartbeats.  It also includes fallback routes for backward compatibility.

* **Metrics Collection:** The class uses a `TankWriterInterface` for sending metrics.


The code showcases a modular design with separate classes or objects handling specific tasks (CPU monitoring, disk monitoring, NTP, audit events, etc.).  The use of `StatFactory` suggests a statistics system is in place.  Error handling is present, using CATCH_ALL_LOG macro and explicit exception handling. The `postConstructor` method handles initialization of various components.  The `run()` method starts the HTTP server and the main monitoring loop.  A significant portion of the code deals with setting and retrieving values from various state objects and potentially using them for reporting or further processing.


## 2:18:30 PM
The log shows several code changes across different files within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr` project, primarily focused on a `NodeMonitor` application and its related components.  The changes span from June 9th, 2025, between 1:38 PM and 2:17 PM.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/PasswordSecurityScanner.cpp`: This file defines a `PasswordSecurityScanner` class responsible for scanning the `/etc/shadow` file for users with default passwords from a predefined list.  The code uses regular expressions to parse shadow file entries, hash algorithms (SHA256 and SHA512) to verify passwords, and logging for debugging and error reporting. The key functionality is implemented by the `scanShadowFileForViolations` function and related helper functions.  The initial commit timestamp is 6/9/2025, 1:38:42 PM.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/util/TObject.hpp`: This file contains the definition of a base class `TObject`, likely used for managing timed events.  The class includes a `TOQKey` inner class for managing timeout queue entries, methods for setting and clearing timers (`setTimer`, `stopTimer`, `clearTimer`), and a virtual `processTimeout` method to be implemented by derived classes.  There were two commits to this file: one at 1:39:05 PM and another at 1:40:07 PM. The second commit appears to be a minor modification to the `processTimeout` method, changing the log message.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.hpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp`: These files define the `NodeMonitor` application class and its associated methods. The `NodeMonitor` class manages various system monitoring tasks, including CPU, memory, disk utilization, NTP status, LDAP retrieval, and password security scanning. It utilizes several other classes defined in other files. There were two commits to the header file (at 1:47:30 PM and 1:47:43 PM), with the second one changing the definition of `sampleTimeout` and `sampleMinuteTimeout` constants from literals to `std::chrono` expressions and makes them `constexpr static`. The `.cpp` file also has two commits (at 1:47:54 PM and 1:55:27 PM) containing the implementation of the  `NodeMonitor` class's methods.  These commits demonstrate extensive system monitoring capabilities.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/util/TObject.cpp`:  This file provides implementations for the timer management methods of the `TObject` class. It uses a `TimeoutQueue` for managing timers and includes error handling and logging. This file has two commits, one at 1:56:20 PM and the other at 1:56:31 PM; the difference appears to be in the log message for `setTimer`.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`: This file defines the `ChassisMonitor` class, responsible for monitoring chassis temperature. The code includes placeholder methods for fetching and writing temperature data to the state.  Two commits exist for this file, one at 2:06:37 PM and another at 2:17:31 PM, both making minor changes to log levels (from `InfoLog` to `DebugLog`).


In summary, the codebase focuses on a comprehensive system monitoring application (`NodeMonitor`) that collects various system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, chassis temperature) and performs security checks (password scanner).  The `TObject` class provides a reusable base class for managing timed events within the system.  The updates are mostly incremental and involve refinements to logging and minor code adjustments across different components.  The use of the `dolly::dynamic` object throughout suggests the use of a JSON-like data structure for data representation.


## 3:15:15 PM
The log file `/Users/cnesbitt/Downloads/nodeMonitor.log` records the startup of the `nodeMonitor` application at 6/9/2025, 2:09:33 PM.  The application initializes by setting various logging modules (ATCS, CFGD, DATA, etc.) to debug level (5).  It then adds four directories (`/etc/128technology/sync`, `/etc/128technology/config-exports`, `/etc/128technology/pki/api`, `/etc/128technology/config-snapshots`) to a synchronized directory list.  The application confirms it's running on a conductor, starts a FLW listener on port 1410, and attempts to fetch and write chassis temperature thresholds to the state.  A DataSampler is created. The log also shows a password security scan of the `/etc/shadow` file, identifying the root user's password as "exit33" and noting that other users are not considered target users for this scan.  Multiple timers are set with durations of 1000ms and 300000ms.  There's a mention of a delayed `DataRecipe::getNodeData()` call due to an invalid zhandle state. Finally, CMC config Ssc is enabled.  A recurring pattern is the setting of numerous logging modules to debug level and the repeated use of DEBUG and INFO level logging messages throughout the startup process.


## 3:18:25 PM
The log shows three revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` on June 9th, 2025.  The key change across all revisions is the consistent replacement of `DebugLog` with `TraceLog` in the logging statements within the `writeTemperatureThresholdsToState`, `fetchTemperaturesFromChassis`, and `writeTemperaturesToState` functions.  This indicates a shift towards more detailed logging, potentially for debugging purposes.  The timestamps show a rapid sequence of changes: 2:43:15 PM, 2:43:34 PM, and 2:43:42 PM, suggesting iterative debugging or code refinement.  The core functionality of the `ChassisMonitor` class, including fetching and writing temperature thresholds and actual temperatures, remains unchanged; only the logging level has been modified.  The `handleChassisHeartbeat` function remains a placeholder throughout the revisions.  The hardcoded temperature values within the `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` and `fetchTemperaturesFromChassis` functions also remain constant.
