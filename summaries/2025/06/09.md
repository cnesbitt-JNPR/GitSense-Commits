# Activity Summary for 6/9/2025

## 12:18:25 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp` on June 9th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions: the code defines a `NodeMonitor` class responsible for monitoring system resources (CPU, memory, disk) and exposing this data via an HTTP API.  The class utilizes various other classes and libraries for tasks like data sampling, logging, and interaction with system calls.

The most significant change occurred between the first and third revisions (11:42:49 AM and 11:43:50 AM).  The `updateStats` method was modified to include a debug log statement: `"NodeMonitor::updateStats() called."`.  This suggests the addition of improved logging for debugging purposes.


No other substantial code changes are apparent between the revisions; the differences are minor and likely related to debugging or very minor refactoring.  The code consistently uses the `dolly` library for JSON manipulation and various Juniper Networks-specific libraries for system interactions and configuration.  The HTTP API endpoints remain unchanged across revisions.

The NodeMonitor.cpp file, last modified on 6/9/2025, 1:12:53 PM,  is a C++ implementation of a node monitoring service.  It heavily utilizes the Dolly library for JSON handling and asynchronous operations.  The code monitors CPU, memory, and disk utilization, NTP server status, and collects audit events.

Key updates include:

* **Resource Utilization Monitoring:**  The class extensively monitors and updates CPU, memory, and disk usage, sending this data to what appears to be a state object (`pNode->getSystem().setCpuUtilization(nodeValue);`, etc.).  The data is formatted into JSON using the Dolly library.

* **NTP Server Status:** The code queries and updates the NTP server status, setting an empty state if NTP is not configured.

* **Audit Event Handling:** It integrates with an `AuditEventCollector` to collect and batch audit events.  A `ResolvConfUpdater` is also used, suggesting management of DNS configuration.

* **HTTP API:** The `NodeMonitor` exposes an HTTP API (`/api/v1/...`) to retrieve system information such as version, PCI addresses, LDAP status, and to handle requests for restarting minions and chassis heartbeats.  It also includes fallback routes for backward compatibility.

* **Metrics Collection:** The class uses a `TankWriterInterface` for sending metrics.


The code showcases a modular design with separate classes or objects handling specific tasks (CPU monitoring, disk monitoring, NTP, audit events, etc.).  The use of `StatFactory` suggests a statistics system is in place.  Error handling is present, using CATCH_ALL_LOG macro and explicit exception handling. The `postConstructor` method handles initialization of various components.  The `run()` method starts the HTTP server and the main monitoring loop.  A significant portion of the code deals with setting and retrieving values from various state objects and potentially using them for reporting or further processing.
