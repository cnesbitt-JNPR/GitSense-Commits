# Activity Summary for 6/10/2025

## 10:22:22 AM
The log shows iterative development of a `ChassisMonitor` class and its associated unit test harness.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` file underwent several revisions between 9:35 AM and 10:16 AM on June 10, 2025.  Early versions contained placeholder functions and hardcoded temperature values for fetching and writing chassis temperatures and thresholds.  The most significant change involved refactoring the `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` function. Initially, it used a POST request with a hardcoded JSON body and a Unix socket path `./mars.sock`. This was then changed to a GET request and the Unix socket path was updated to `./chassismanager.sock`. Finally, it was further modified to use a  `/var/run/128technology/chassis-manager.sock` path, making it more robust and production ready. Error handling was also improved, with added checks for non-200 HTTP status codes and invalid JSON responses.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp` file, which contains the unit test harness, was modified between 9:58 AM and 10:00 AM on June 10, 2025.  The initial version had placeholder comments for overriding methods in `ChassisMonitor`. It was then improved to include a complete override for `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis`, using `curl::HttpResponse` to simulate a successful response with dummy data, thus allowing for more comprehensive testing.  A redundant `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` override was removed in the final version.

Recurring elements throughout the code include the use of the `dolly::dynamic` type for representing JSON data, extensive use of logging (TraceLog and WarningLog), and the consistent use of  Unix sockets for communication with the `ChassisManager`.  Many functions still contain `// todo` comments indicating areas needing further implementation.


## 11:22:25 AM
The log shows iterative development of a `ChassisMonitor` class within a NodeMonitor application.  The primary focus is on fetching and writing chassis temperature thresholds and temperatures to a state object.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` underwent numerous revisions between 10:52 AM and 11:15 AM on June 10, 2025.  Early versions contained numerous `//todo` comments, indicating areas needing further implementation.  Significant changes include:

* **Error Handling Improvements (10:59 AM - 11:04 AM):** The `parseTemperatureThresholdsChassisResponse` function was enhanced to return `dolly::dynamic()` on errors instead of an empty object, improving error handling.  The error message in `parseTemperatureThresholdsChassisResponse` for an invalid format was also made clearer.

* **Modularization (11:01 AM - 11:03 AM):** The `InitializeChassisStats` function was refactored to call a new `InitializeChassisTemperatureThresholds` function, improving code organization.  A check for null thresholds was added to handle communication failures with the ChassisManager.

* **State Management (11:01 AM - 11:02 AM):**  A `thresholdsInitialized` boolean flag was introduced to track the initialization status of temperature thresholds.


* **Temperature Update Logic (11:08 AM - 11:09 AM):** The `UpdateChassisStats` function was refactored to call a separate `UpdateChassisTemperatures` function, improving code structure and readability.  The `UpdateChassisTemperatures` function now checks `thresholdsInitialized` and calls `InitializeChassisTemperatureThresholds()` if necessary.

* **Case Changes (11:13 AM - 11:15 AM):**  Function names were consistently changed from camelCase (`InitializeChassisStats`, `UpdateChassisStats`) to snake_case (`initializeChassisStats`, `updateChassisStats`), improving coding style consistency.  A comment was added to indicate how to handle fan condition changes and subsequent threshold updates.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.hpp` was updated at 11:06 AM and 11:13 AM and 11:14 AM on June 10, 2025. These changes primarily reflected the changes in the `.cpp` file,  modifying function signatures and adding or removing functions to match the implementation in the `.cpp` file.  Specifically, the return type of `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` and `fetchTemperaturesFromChassis` were changed to `const curl::HttpResponse`. Also, a new function `parseTemperaturesChassisResponse` was added.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp` shows the creation of a test harness class at 11:12 AM on June 10, 2025, designed to mock the behavior of the `ChassisMonitor` for unit testing purposes. This class overrides several methods to return dummy data and to directly populate the internal state, allowing isolated testing of the core logic without needing the actual ChassisManager.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp` shows a large portion of the NodeMonitor class,  unrelated to the ChassisMonitor but indicating the context of its usage within the overall Node Monitoring system.  This file is updated only once, at 11:14 AM on June 10, 2025, showing the integration of `pChassisMonitor` into the NodeMonitor's update cycle.
