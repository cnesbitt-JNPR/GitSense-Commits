# Activity Summary for 6/10/2025

## 10:22:22 AM
The log shows iterative development of a `ChassisMonitor` class and its associated unit test harness.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` file underwent several revisions between 9:35 AM and 10:16 AM on June 10, 2025.  Early versions contained placeholder functions and hardcoded temperature values for fetching and writing chassis temperatures and thresholds.  The most significant change involved refactoring the `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` function. Initially, it used a POST request with a hardcoded JSON body and a Unix socket path `./mars.sock`. This was then changed to a GET request and the Unix socket path was updated to `./chassismanager.sock`. Finally, it was further modified to use a  `/var/run/128technology/chassis-manager.sock` path, making it more robust and production ready. Error handling was also improved, with added checks for non-200 HTTP status codes and invalid JSON responses.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp` file, which contains the unit test harness, was modified between 9:58 AM and 10:00 AM on June 10, 2025.  The initial version had placeholder comments for overriding methods in `ChassisMonitor`. It was then improved to include a complete override for `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis`, using `curl::HttpResponse` to simulate a successful response with dummy data, thus allowing for more comprehensive testing.  A redundant `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` override was removed in the final version.

Recurring elements throughout the code include the use of the `dolly::dynamic` type for representing JSON data, extensive use of logging (TraceLog and WarningLog), and the consistent use of  Unix sockets for communication with the `ChassisManager`.  Many functions still contain `// todo` comments indicating areas needing further implementation.
