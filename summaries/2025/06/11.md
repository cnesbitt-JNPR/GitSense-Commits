# Activity Summary for 6/11/2025

## 10:43:32 AM
The log shows several code changes across two files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`**: This file underwent two minor updates within a minute of each other (between 9:48:51 AM and 9:49:04 AM on June 11, 2025). The only change was within the `initializeChassisTemperatureThresholds` function: `thresholds` was initialized to `dolly::dynamic::object()` in the first version and to `dolly::dynamic()` in the second.  The code focuses on fetching and parsing chassis temperature thresholds and temperatures from a chassis manager, likely using a Unix socket connection (`./chassis-manager.sock`), and updating the application state accordingly. Error handling for HTTP requests (checking for status code 200) and JSON parsing is implemented.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`**: This file shows a series of updates between 10:08:00 AM and 10:33:50 AM on June 11, 2025.  The changes are primarily additions to the test suite, expanding test coverage for various alarm handling scenarios.  Recurring elements include numerous test cases (`TEST`) focusing on different aspects of alarm generation and clearing (`processStateChange`, `processAlarmOnNodeDeletion`).  These tests cover scenarios like version mismatches, CPU usage, and other system metrics. The addition of `getExpectedChassisManagerDisconnectedAlarm` at 10:32:44 AM and further updates suggest an expansion of the test suite to include handling of chassis manager disconnections.  The tests heavily utilize helper functions (`getExpectedCpuAlarm`, `getExpectedVersionMismatchedAlarm`, etc.) to create expected alarm objects for comparison. The consistent use of `expectAlarmsEqual` indicates a robust comparison mechanism for verifying alarm properties.

The log shows code changes across two files, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`, between 10:52 AM and 11:17 AM on June 11, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`:  This file contains unit tests for `SystemChangeHandler`. Multiple revisions show additions and no deletions of test cases focusing on alarm handling for various system events like version mismatches, CPU usage, and others.  The tests extensively use `EXPECT_EQ` and `ASSERT_TRUE` to verify the expected alarm actions (Add, Clear, None). There's a pattern of testing different scenarios (one node, two nodes, clearing alarms) for each type of alarm.  The code remains largely unchanged structurally across all revisions, with only minor changes in test cases.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`: This file implements a `ChassisMonitor` class responsible for fetching and processing chassis temperature data.  The main changes revolve around the `failureCount` variable, initially named `failCount`.  The initial version used `failureCount > 3` as a threshold for marking chassis temperatures as unavailable, while later versions changed this to `failureCount > 20`. There is a renaming of the variable from `failCount` to `failureCount` and then `consecutiveFailureCount` in the final revision.  The  `consecutiveFailureCount` change suggests an improvement to handle multiple consecutive failures before reporting a disconnect.  The logic for fetching temperature thresholds and temperatures from the chassis manager remains consistent, utilizing a Unix socket connection (`./chassis-manager.sock`) for communication.  The code uses the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON parsing and manipulation and logging is performed using `TraceLog`, `WarningLog`, and `DebugLog`.
