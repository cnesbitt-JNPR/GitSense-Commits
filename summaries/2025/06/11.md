# Activity Summary for 6/11/2025

## 10:43:32 AM
The log shows several code changes across two files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`**: This file underwent two minor updates within a minute of each other (between 9:48:51 AM and 9:49:04 AM on June 11, 2025). The only change was within the `initializeChassisTemperatureThresholds` function: `thresholds` was initialized to `dolly::dynamic::object()` in the first version and to `dolly::dynamic()` in the second.  The code focuses on fetching and parsing chassis temperature thresholds and temperatures from a chassis manager, likely using a Unix socket connection (`./chassis-manager.sock`), and updating the application state accordingly. Error handling for HTTP requests (checking for status code 200) and JSON parsing is implemented.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`**: This file shows a series of updates between 10:08:00 AM and 10:33:50 AM on June 11, 2025.  The changes are primarily additions to the test suite, expanding test coverage for various alarm handling scenarios.  Recurring elements include numerous test cases (`TEST`) focusing on different aspects of alarm generation and clearing (`processStateChange`, `processAlarmOnNodeDeletion`).  These tests cover scenarios like version mismatches, CPU usage, and other system metrics. The addition of `getExpectedChassisManagerDisconnectedAlarm` at 10:32:44 AM and further updates suggest an expansion of the test suite to include handling of chassis manager disconnections.  The tests heavily utilize helper functions (`getExpectedCpuAlarm`, `getExpectedVersionMismatchedAlarm`, etc.) to create expected alarm objects for comparison. The consistent use of `expectAlarmsEqual` indicates a robust comparison mechanism for verifying alarm properties.
