# Activity Summary for 6/11/2025

## 10:43:32 AM
The log shows several code changes across two files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`**: This file underwent two minor updates within a minute of each other (between 9:48:51 AM and 9:49:04 AM on June 11, 2025). The only change was within the `initializeChassisTemperatureThresholds` function: `thresholds` was initialized to `dolly::dynamic::object()` in the first version and to `dolly::dynamic()` in the second.  The code focuses on fetching and parsing chassis temperature thresholds and temperatures from a chassis manager, likely using a Unix socket connection (`./chassis-manager.sock`), and updating the application state accordingly. Error handling for HTTP requests (checking for status code 200) and JSON parsing is implemented.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`**: This file shows a series of updates between 10:08:00 AM and 10:33:50 AM on June 11, 2025.  The changes are primarily additions to the test suite, expanding test coverage for various alarm handling scenarios.  Recurring elements include numerous test cases (`TEST`) focusing on different aspects of alarm generation and clearing (`processStateChange`, `processAlarmOnNodeDeletion`).  These tests cover scenarios like version mismatches, CPU usage, and other system metrics. The addition of `getExpectedChassisManagerDisconnectedAlarm` at 10:32:44 AM and further updates suggest an expansion of the test suite to include handling of chassis manager disconnections.  The tests heavily utilize helper functions (`getExpectedCpuAlarm`, `getExpectedVersionMismatchedAlarm`, etc.) to create expected alarm objects for comparison. The consistent use of `expectAlarmsEqual` indicates a robust comparison mechanism for verifying alarm properties.


## 11:43:32 AM
The log shows code changes across two files, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`, between 10:52 AM and 11:17 AM on June 11, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`:  This file contains unit tests for `SystemChangeHandler`. Multiple revisions show additions and no deletions of test cases focusing on alarm handling for various system events like version mismatches, CPU usage, and others.  The tests extensively use `EXPECT_EQ` and `ASSERT_TRUE` to verify the expected alarm actions (Add, Clear, None). There's a pattern of testing different scenarios (one node, two nodes, clearing alarms) for each type of alarm.  The code remains largely unchanged structurally across all revisions, with only minor changes in test cases.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`: This file implements a `ChassisMonitor` class responsible for fetching and processing chassis temperature data.  The main changes revolve around the `failureCount` variable, initially named `failCount`.  The initial version used `failureCount > 3` as a threshold for marking chassis temperatures as unavailable, while later versions changed this to `failureCount > 20`. There is a renaming of the variable from `failCount` to `failureCount` and then `consecutiveFailureCount` in the final revision.  The  `consecutiveFailureCount` change suggests an improvement to handle multiple consecutive failures before reporting a disconnect.  The logic for fetching temperature thresholds and temperatures from the chassis manager remains consistent, utilizing a Unix socket connection (`./chassis-manager.sock`) for communication.  The code uses the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON parsing and manipulation and logging is performed using `TraceLog`, `WarningLog`, and `DebugLog`.


## 12:26:50 PM
The provided code represents unit tests for a `SystemChangeHandler` class, likely part of an alarm management system.  The tests cover various scenarios related to alarm generation and clearing, focusing on different alarm types and node states.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` file underwent two modifications on June 11th, 2025.  Both modifications at 11:58:57 AM and 11:59:27 AM show no code change.  The code itself defines several helper functions (`getExpectedCpuAlarm`, `getExpectedVersionMismatchedAlarm`, etc.) for creating expected alarm objects based on different system states.  These functions are used within the test cases to verify the `SystemChangeHandler`'s behavior.

The test cases (`TEST` macros) primarily involve calling `processStateChange` and `processAlarmOnNodeDeletion` methods of the `SystemChangeHandler` with various inputs (nodeName, value, pathKey) simulating system state changes and node deletions.  The tests then assert the expected outcome: `Action::None`, `Action::Add`, or `Action::Clear`.

Specifically, tests exist for:

* **Version Mismatch Alarms:**  Testing alarm generation and clearing when software versions between nodes are mismatched.  This includes scenarios with one or two nodes, and clearing via state change or node deletion.
* **CPU Usage Alarms:**  Testing alarm generation and clearing based on CPU utilization, incorporating debouncing mechanisms and handling of isolation/dedication masks.  Tests cover scenarios with one and two nodes.  A debounce count of 30 is used before an alarm is triggered.

The code uses Google Test framework (`gtest/gtest.h`) for assertions.  The consistent use of `expectAlarmsEqual` suggests a focus on thorough comparison of generated alarms against expected values.  The use of `dolly::parseJson` hints at JSON data structures being used to represent system states.  The code also uses several custom types from the `alarms` and `state` namespaces (e.g., `alarms::Severity`, `state::Category`).


## 2:26:56 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` between 1:47 PM and 2:22 PM on June 11, 2025.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` file underwent several updates, primarily focused on adding and refining unit tests for various alarm handling scenarios. These tests cover different alarm types (CPU usage, version mismatch, config node utilization, etc.) and their associated states (Add, Clear, None).  There's a recurring pattern of testing alarm behavior for one and two nodes, along with scenarios involving clearing alarms.  A significant number of these tests use `EXPECT_EQ` and `ASSERT_TRUE` from the Google Test framework (`gtest/gtest.h`).

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` file also experienced multiple revisions during the same period. The updates involved adding and modifying functions related to alarm handling, particularly focusing on CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space, and NTP server status. The code extensively utilizes the `dolly` library for JSON parsing and manipulation.  The `handle...Change` functions consistently parse JSON data from `statePathInfo.value`, process the data, and trigger `Action::Add` or `Action::Clear` based on predefined thresholds.  A notable change is the consistent use of  `dolly::parseJson`  within functions designed to parse JSON data,  improving error handling compared to previous versions.  The final revision shows no significant changes compared to the previous revision of this file.


## 3:26:52 PM
The log shows updates to three files within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr` directory between 2:31 PM and 3:24 PM on June 11, 2025.  The changes primarily involve enhancements and refinements to alarm handling and state parsing within a system monitoring application.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` was updated twice, with minor revisions in the second update.  The file manages system alarms based on various state changes.  The code handles alarms for memory usage, CPU utilization, disk space, NTP server status, and connection status.  These handlers generate and clear alarms based on predefined thresholds and conditions.  Significant changes involve refining alarm handling logic, for example, in how memory and disk usage alarms are triggered and cleared.  The second update doesn't introduce major functional changes, suggesting minor bug fixes or code style adjustments.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp` underwent several revisions within a short timeframe. The file is responsible for parsing and interpreting system state data.  The updates focus on refining the `parseChassisManagerTemperatures` function and improving the `findTempsAboveThreshold` function (renamed to `findTempsAtThreshold` in the final revision) to accurately identify sensors exceeding temperature thresholds.  This indicates a focus on enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of temperature monitoring and alarm generation. The modifications primarily involve changes to the logic within temperature sensor evaluation and improving the return type of the function to simply be a vector instead of a tuple.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateEnums.hpp` also received two minor updates. This file defines various enumerations used throughout the application, such as interface statuses, alarm categories, and asset states. The updates made show the removal of the `ChassisManagerTemperatureThresholds` enum, which possibly means a restructuring of the way chassis manager temperature information is handled or a removal of this specific element.  The second update is a minor formatting change likely due to automated code formatting tools.  These changes are primarily cosmetic and don't significantly alter functionality.

In summary, the code modifications concentrate on improving the reliability and precision of system monitoring, particularly in alarm generation for resource utilization (memory, CPU, disk) and temperature.  The evolution of the `StateDataParser.cpp` file reflects an iterative refinement process to achieve this goal, with a focus on error handling and threshold-based alerts.


## 4:26:58 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateEnums.hpp` files between 3:27 PM and 4:26 PM on June 11, 2025.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp`:**  This file underwent multiple revisions, primarily focusing on the `parseChassisManagerTemperatures` function.  Early versions had a flawed implementation of `findTempsAtThreshold`,  which was corrected in later versions to correctly process temperature thresholds (Yellow and Red) and construct sensor strings with proper comma separation.  The initial versions of `parseChassisManagerTemperatures` contained a syntax error where variable assignments were missing the assignment operator.  These errors were fixed in subsequent commits.  The final version uses `state::ChassisManagerTemperatureThresholds` enum for better type safety.  The inclusion of `<dolly/dynamic.h>` was removed in a later commit, simplifying dependencies.  The core functionality of parsing various state data types (CPU utilization, disk utilization, config application state, connections status, etc.) remained consistent throughout the revisions.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateEnums.hpp`:** This file received a single update at 3:29:32 PM on June 11, 2025. The update added  `Unknown` to the `ChassisManagerTemperatureThresholds` enum, indicating a more comprehensive handling of temperature states.


The overall pattern in `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp` revisions suggests iterative debugging and refinement of the temperature parsing logic. The updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateEnums.hpp` indicate an enhancement to the temperature threshold handling to include unknown states.  The `StateDataParser.cpp` file consistently uses the `dolly` library for JSON parsing and manipulation.  The frequent commits to `StateDataParser.cpp` suggest a rapid development or debugging cycle.


## 5:26:58 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.hpp` files between 4:29 PM and 4:54 PM on June 11, 2025.  These changes primarily involve modifications to the `SystemChangeHandler` class, which seems to be responsible for handling system-level alarms.  The `.cpp` file contains numerous functions for handling changes related to memory, disk space, CPU utilization, NTP servers, connections, and other system components.  These functions typically involve parsing JSON data, checking thresholds, and creating or clearing alarms based on predefined criteria.

The `.hpp` file defines the `SystemChangeHandler` class, its members, and various helper functions.  A noteworthy change is the addition of  `handleChassisManagerTemperaturesChange` function and its related helper functions in the later updates to the header file, suggesting an extension of the system's monitoring capabilities to include chassis manager temperature monitoring.  The `handleChassisManagerTemperaturesChange` function is modified to be a const function in one of the later commits.

Between 5:01 PM and 5:03 PM, the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.hpp` file received an update. This file introduces the `ChassisMonitor` class, which seems to be responsible for fetching and processing chassis temperature information via HTTP requests, using the `curl` library. This class interacts with the `state` object for storing chassis data.

Finally, the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/CMakeLists.txt` file was modified twice, at 5:02 PM and 5:03 PM.  These changes seem to be related to updating the test configuration for the `NodeMonitor` application. The file lists various test sources and their dependencies, including several `128T_` libraries.  The additions and modifications appear to be related to adding and updating tests.  There is no substantive change in the content between the two commits for this file.  The pattern suggests a build system adding more tests.
