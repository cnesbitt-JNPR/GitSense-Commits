# Activity Summary for 6/12/2025

## 10:12:08 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/SystemTestLiterals.hpp` files.  The `SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` file contains unit tests for a `SystemChangeHandler` class, which appears to be responsible for processing system state changes and generating alarms.  The tests cover various scenarios, including version mismatches, CPU utilization, and other system events.  There are no observable content changes between the first three revisions of  `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`. However, the last revision is identical to the second one.

The `SystemTestLiterals.hpp` file provides constants used in the unit tests, defining various JSON structures representing different system states (CPU utilization, disk utilization, memory utilization, connection status, software version, config node utilization, default password violations, certificate expiration status and chassis manager temperature).  The file was modified twice, with the second modification occurring at 9:58:18 AM on June 12, 2025.  The content changes between the two revisions of this file are not readily apparent from the provided diff.

The most significant changes in the code log appear to be the addition of new test cases in `SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` related to different types of system alarms and their handling by the `SystemChangeHandler`. The tests extensively use `EXPECT_EQ` assertions to verify the generated alarms against expected values.  A recurring pattern is the use of helper functions (`getExpected*Alarm`) to construct expected alarm objects based on input parameters, simplifying the test cases.  The tests also demonstrate alarm clearing mechanisms, both through state changes and explicit node deletion.  A debounce mechanism is evident in the CPU usage tests, where a series of state changes below a threshold are ignored before an alarm is triggered.

The provided log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp` files.  The changes primarily focus on adding and refining unit tests for alarm handling and state data parsing.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`:**

This file undergoes several revisions between 10:21 AM and 11:02 AM. The key changes involve:

* **Adding `getExpectedChassisManagerYellowTempAlarm` and `getExpectedChassisManagerRedTempAlarm` functions:**  These functions generate expected alarm objects for chassis manager temperature alerts, initially at MAJOR severity for both Yellow and Red thresholds. Later, Yellow threshold alarms are changed to CRITICAL severity, and the alarm messages are refined to reflect system performance throttling and potential shutdown. The alarm message for red threshold is updated to clearly explain its impact on system performance.

* **No substantial changes in test cases:**  The test cases themselves remain largely consistent across revisions, focusing on testing various alarm scenarios (version mismatch, CPU usage, default passwords, certificate expiration).  However,  the `getExpected...` helper functions used within the tests are modified to reflect the updated alarm messages and severities.

* **Consistent use of `AlarmFactory` and `SystemChangeHandler`:** The tests consistently utilize `AlarmFactory` and `SystemChangeHandler` classes to create and process alarms, indicating a well-structured testing approach.  The `expectAlarmsEqual` function is used for consistent comparison of expected and actual alarms.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp`:**

This file is revised once at 11:07 AM.  The notable change is in:

* **Refining `parseChassisManagerTemperatures`:** The function's logic for parsing chassis manager temperatures is adjusted to use `ThresholdTraits::toStdString` instead of a direct string representation of threshold values.  This improves the code's maintainability and readability.


**Overall Patterns:**

* **Consistent Copyright Notice:** All files consistently include the Juniper Networks copyright notice.
* **Extensive use of helper functions:**  Both files use numerous helper functions to improve code readability and reduce redundancy in the test cases and parsing logic.
* **JSON Parsing:** Both files make heavy use of `dolly::parseJson` for parsing JSON data, indicating that the system uses JSON for representing state and configuration information.
* **Alarm Severity Levels:** The code handles multiple alarm severity levels (MINOR, MAJOR, CRITICAL), enabling different responses to varying levels of system issues.


The iterative changes in `SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` suggest a process of refining the test suite to more accurately represent the system's behavior and provide better descriptions of alert conditions.  The change in `StateDataParser.cpp` reflects a minor improvement in code style and consistency.
