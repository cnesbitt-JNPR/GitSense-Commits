# Activity Summary for 6/12/2025

## 10:12:08 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/SystemTestLiterals.hpp` files.  The `SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` file contains unit tests for a `SystemChangeHandler` class, which appears to be responsible for processing system state changes and generating alarms.  The tests cover various scenarios, including version mismatches, CPU utilization, and other system events.  There are no observable content changes between the first three revisions of  `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`. However, the last revision is identical to the second one.

The `SystemTestLiterals.hpp` file provides constants used in the unit tests, defining various JSON structures representing different system states (CPU utilization, disk utilization, memory utilization, connection status, software version, config node utilization, default password violations, certificate expiration status and chassis manager temperature).  The file was modified twice, with the second modification occurring at 9:58:18 AM on June 12, 2025.  The content changes between the two revisions of this file are not readily apparent from the provided diff.

The most significant changes in the code log appear to be the addition of new test cases in `SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` related to different types of system alarms and their handling by the `SystemChangeHandler`. The tests extensively use `EXPECT_EQ` assertions to verify the generated alarms against expected values.  A recurring pattern is the use of helper functions (`getExpected*Alarm`) to construct expected alarm objects based on input parameters, simplifying the test cases.  The tests also demonstrate alarm clearing mechanisms, both through state changes and explicit node deletion.  A debounce mechanism is evident in the CPU usage tests, where a series of state changes below a threshold are ignored before an alarm is triggered.
