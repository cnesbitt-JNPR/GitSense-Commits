# Activity Summary for 6/16/2025

## 11:16:06 AM
The provided log shows three updates to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` file and one update to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.hpp`.  All changes occur within a short time frame on June 16th, 2025, between 11:12 AM and 11:15 AM.  The `.cpp` file updates appear to be incremental, with no substantial structural changes.  The changes primarily involve minor additions or modifications within existing functions related to alarm handling.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` file shows consistent additions and modifications across the three commits, suggesting iterative development. Each commit includes updates to various `handle...Change` functions,  indicating improvements in the system's alarm handling capabilities for resources like memory, disk space, CPU utilization, NTP servers, and connections.  The code consistently uses the `dolly::parseJson` function to process JSON-formatted state information.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.hpp` file update at 11:15:32 AM  adds a new class member `nodeVersions` of type `util::EnumArray<VersionsEnum, std::string>`, and several new private member functions (e.g., `handleNewEntitlementStatusChange`, `handleExistingEntitlementStatusChange`, etc.), suggesting the addition of functionality for handling entitlement status changes,  SNMP agent state changes, application ID cache utilization, CRL unreachability, certificate reports, and chassis manager status.  The addition of hardcoded thresholds (cpuUsageTriggerThreshold, etc.) indicates a placeholder for future configuration options.  The header file also shows the introduction of a `CpuData` struct to manage CPU-related alarm data.  The overall structure of the header file suggests improved organization and expansion of alarm handling capabilities.
