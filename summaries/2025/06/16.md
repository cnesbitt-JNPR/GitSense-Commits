# Activity Summary for 6/16/2025

## 11:16:06 AM
The provided log shows three updates to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` file and one update to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.hpp`.  All changes occur within a short time frame on June 16th, 2025, between 11:12 AM and 11:15 AM.  The `.cpp` file updates appear to be incremental, with no substantial structural changes.  The changes primarily involve minor additions or modifications within existing functions related to alarm handling.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` file shows consistent additions and modifications across the three commits, suggesting iterative development. Each commit includes updates to various `handle...Change` functions,  indicating improvements in the system's alarm handling capabilities for resources like memory, disk space, CPU utilization, NTP servers, and connections.  The code consistently uses the `dolly::parseJson` function to process JSON-formatted state information.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.hpp` file update at 11:15:32 AM  adds a new class member `nodeVersions` of type `util::EnumArray<VersionsEnum, std::string>`, and several new private member functions (e.g., `handleNewEntitlementStatusChange`, `handleExistingEntitlementStatusChange`, etc.), suggesting the addition of functionality for handling entitlement status changes,  SNMP agent state changes, application ID cache utilization, CRL unreachability, certificate reports, and chassis manager status.  The addition of hardcoded thresholds (cpuUsageTriggerThreshold, etc.) indicates a placeholder for future configuration options.  The header file also shows the introduction of a `CpuData` struct to manage CPU-related alarm data.  The overall structure of the header file suggests improved organization and expansion of alarm handling capabilities.


## 12:16:09 PM
The log shows multiple code changes across several files within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr` directory on June 16th, 2025.  The primary focus appears to be on the `SystemChangeHandler` class and its associated test suite (`SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`).

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.hpp`: This header file underwent two updates.  The first (11:17:25 AM) defined the `SystemChangeHandler` class, responsible for processing various system state changes and generating alarms based on predefined thresholds.  The class includes numerous methods to handle changes related to CPU usage, memory, disk space, connections, configuration application state, entitlement status, NTP servers, SNMP agent state, software versions, application ID cache utilization, CRL (Certificate Revocation List) reachability, certificate reports, and Chassis Manager status (including temperature monitoring).  The second update (12:02:21 PM) removed the `buildDefaultPasswordAlarmMessage` and `buildDefaultPasswordAlarmValue` methods, and  several other minor modifications to the header file.  Hardcoded threshold values for CPU, memory, and disk space usage are present.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`: This file, containing unit tests for `SystemChangeHandler`, was updated once (11:55:50 AM) and then again at 12:02:35 PM. These changes seem to add and update tests for various alarm scenarios including  version mismatches, CPU usage, and other system events handled by `SystemChangeHandler`.  The tests use helper functions to create expected alarm objects for comparison.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp`: This source file, implementing the `SystemChangeHandler` class, was updated twice (11:56:41 AM and 12:02:06 PM). The updates include the implementation of methods declared in the header file,  showing detailed logic for alarm creation and state change handling.  It utilizes the `dolly` library for JSON parsing and manipulation, along with custom functions for threshold checking and data aggregation. Noteworthy is the error handling within the JSON parsing methods.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp`: This file contains unit tests for a `ChassisMonitor`, seemingly a component responsible for monitoring chassis temperatures and connectivity. Two identical updates are present (11:59:41 AM and 12:01:56 PM), indicating the test suite for the Chassis Monitor focuses on initializing and updating chassis statistics, handling disconnection scenarios and checking for blank thresholds and temperatures. The `dolly` library is used here as well.

Overall, the changes reflect iterative development and testing of a system alarm handling component and its integration with chassis monitoring.  The consistent use of the `dolly` library suggests a reliance on its JSON processing capabilities throughout the codebase.  The timestamps indicate a focused period of development and testing within a short timeframe.  There is no discernible pattern of changes beyond the general enhancement and testing of the alarm system.


## 2:16:09 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of C++ code across three files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp`, and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateTest.cpp`.  The changes span a period from 1:32 PM to 2:02 PM on June 16th, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` underwent several minor revisions between 1:32 PM and 1:35 PM. These revisions appear to involve no significant code changes; rather, the timestamps suggest iterative compilation or testing.  The file contains unit tests for a `SystemChangeHandler`, focusing on alarm handling for various system events (CPU utilization, software version mismatch, config node utilization, etc.).  The tests use `gtest` framework and involve methods like `processStateChange` and `processAlarmOnNodeDeletion`.  A debounce mechanism is also present in the CPU usage alarm test.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp` was modified twice, at 1:41 PM and 1:42 PM. The changes seem minor, possibly related to refactoring or bug fixes within the `findTempsAtThreshold` function. This file implements a `StateDataParser` class responsible for parsing JSON state data and populating a `ParsedStateDataMap`.  Multiple `parse` methods exist for various state types (CPU utilization, disk utilization, certificate reports, etc.).  The code uses the `dolly` library for JSON handling.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateTest.cpp` shows several revisions between 2:00 PM and 2:02 PM. The changes are also likely minor and possibly related to refinements in the tests rather than substantial functional alterations. This file contains unit tests for the `state` library, employing classes like `MockPda` (simulating a persistent data client) and `StateClient`. It uses the `gtest` framework for testing and involves interactions with persistent data through methods like `getState`, `verifyState`, and `verifyStateClear`.

In summary, the log reflects ongoing development and testing activities on alarm handling and state data parsing components.  The repeated minor revisions suggest an iterative process of debugging and testing.  The code extensively uses the `dolly` library for JSON processing and `gtest` for unit testing.
