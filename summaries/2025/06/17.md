# Activity Summary for 6/17/2025

## 11:16:05 AM
The provided log shows several revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.hpp` between 10:22:17 AM and 10:28:26 AM on June 17, 2025.  The file content remained unchanged across these revisions.  This suggests that the file was likely being modified outside the scope of this log capture, perhaps through a version control system.

A separate file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`, was updated at 10:31:47 AM on the same day. This file implements a `ChassisMonitor` class responsible for fetching and monitoring chassis temperatures.  The class interacts with a "ChassisManager" via a Unix socket (`./chassis-manager.sock`) using HTTP requests to retrieve temperature thresholds and current temperatures.  It then writes this information to a state object. The code includes error handling for HTTP requests that do not return a 200 status code and retry mechanisms for failed temperature fetches. A `handleChassisHeartbeat` function assesses the overall system health based on the presence of major or critical alarms in the alarm table, returning a JSON response indicating health status and reason.
