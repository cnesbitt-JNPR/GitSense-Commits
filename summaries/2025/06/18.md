# Activity Summary for 6/18/2025

## 10:16:06 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` on June 18th, 2025.  The file is concerned with monitoring chassis temperatures.  The initial version (9:54:43 AM) establishes the foundation for fetching and parsing temperature data and thresholds from a chassis manager via a Unix socket and HTTP requests to "http://localhost/api/v1/chassis/temperature" and "http://localhost/api/v1/chassis/temperature/threshold". It includes functions to handle HTTP responses, parse JSON data, and update the application state with the collected information.  Error handling is implemented to manage network issues and invalid JSON responses. A `consecutiveFailureCount` is used to track consecutive failures.

Subsequent revisions (9:56:22 AM, 9:59:15 AM, and 9:59:28 AM) primarily focus on refining the error handling for fetching chassis temperatures.  Specifically, the major change is the introduction of `retriesUntilDisconnected`, a constant representing the number of consecutive failed attempts before marking the chassis manager as disconnected (set to 20, implying 20 seconds).  The magic number 20 was later explicitly documented as 20 seconds.  The code remains functionally similar throughout the revisions, with the core logic for fetching, parsing, and updating temperature data unchanged.  The final version (9:59:28 AM) includes a well-defined constant for retries instead of a magic number in the code.  There are also several `//TODO` comments that indicate areas needing further development, notably the `handleChassisHeartbeat` function. The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp` file, on the other hand, is updated only once (9:34:15 AM) and it's a much larger file, this file appears to be a comprehensive state data parser responsible for handling various data types (CPU utilization, disk utilization, configuration node utilization, connection status, peer path status, process events, DNS resolutions, asset information, service path status, alarm information, certificate reports, and chassis manager temperatures) and populating a `ParsedStateDataMap`.  The parsing functions extensively use the `dolly::dynamic` and `dolly::json` libraries for JSON manipulation.
