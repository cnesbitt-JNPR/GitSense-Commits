# Activity Summary for 6/18/2025

## 10:16:06 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` on June 18th, 2025.  The file is concerned with monitoring chassis temperatures.  The initial version (9:54:43 AM) establishes the foundation for fetching and parsing temperature data and thresholds from a chassis manager via a Unix socket and HTTP requests to "http://localhost/api/v1/chassis/temperature" and "http://localhost/api/v1/chassis/temperature/threshold". It includes functions to handle HTTP responses, parse JSON data, and update the application state with the collected information.  Error handling is implemented to manage network issues and invalid JSON responses. A `consecutiveFailureCount` is used to track consecutive failures.

Subsequent revisions (9:56:22 AM, 9:59:15 AM, and 9:59:28 AM) primarily focus on refining the error handling for fetching chassis temperatures.  Specifically, the major change is the introduction of `retriesUntilDisconnected`, a constant representing the number of consecutive failed attempts before marking the chassis manager as disconnected (set to 20, implying 20 seconds).  The magic number 20 was later explicitly documented as 20 seconds.  The code remains functionally similar throughout the revisions, with the core logic for fetching, parsing, and updating temperature data unchanged.  The final version (9:59:28 AM) includes a well-defined constant for retries instead of a magic number in the code.  There are also several `//TODO` comments that indicate areas needing further development, notably the `handleChassisHeartbeat` function. The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp` file, on the other hand, is updated only once (9:34:15 AM) and it's a much larger file, this file appears to be a comprehensive state data parser responsible for handling various data types (CPU utilization, disk utilization, configuration node utilization, connection status, peer path status, process events, DNS resolutions, asset information, service path status, alarm information, certificate reports, and chassis manager temperatures) and populating a `ParsedStateDataMap`.  The parsing functions extensively use the `dolly::dynamic` and `dolly::json` libraries for JSON manipulation.


## 11:16:07 AM
The log shows multiple code changes across two files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` underwent several revisions between 10:36 AM and 11:14 AM on June 18th, 2025.  These changes appear to be minor edits and do not reflect substantial functional alterations to the code.  The core logic for handling system changes and generating alarms remains consistent across these revisions.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` was modified between 11:04 AM and 11:12 AM on June 18th, 2025. The most significant change is in `parseChassisResponseJson` function at 11:11:45 AM, where the check for HTTP status code changed from `response.statusCode != 200` to `response.statusCode != http::Code::Ok`, suggesting a potential improvement in error handling by using a more descriptive enum. Another noteworthy change involved adding `assert(pNode != nullptr)` in  `writeTemperatureInfoToState` and `writeTemperatureInfoUnavailable` functions at 11:04:43 AM and 11:05:12 AM respectively, improving robustness by explicitly checking for null pointers.  The file focuses on monitoring chassis temperatures, fetching data, parsing JSON responses, and updating the application state accordingly.  There is a consistent pattern of fetching data from a chassis manager via a Unix socket, parsing JSON responses, and writing the resulting data to the application state.  A retry mechanism is implemented to handle potential connection issues with the chassis manager.


## 12:16:26 PM
The log shows multiple code changes across several files within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr` project on June 18th, 2025.  The modifications primarily focus on alarm handling and state data parsing.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`: This file contains unit tests for `SystemChangeHandler`.  The tests cover various scenarios, including: version mismatch alarms (adding, clearing, clearing on node deletion), CPU usage alarms (with and without dedicated core masks), and other system alarms (default passwords, chassis manager disconnections, and certificate expirations). Updates to this file occurred at 11:16:49 AM, 11:55:24 AM, and 12:03:35 PM. The 12:03:35 PM update involved a change in the severity level of the `getExpectedChassisManagerDisconnectedAlarm` function, from MAJOR to CRITICAL.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp`: This file contains the implementation of the `StateDataParser` class.  This class parses JSON-formatted state data and populates a map with parsed information.  Multiple `parse` functions handle different data types (CPU utilization, disk utilization, config node utilization, application states, connections status, peer path status, process events, DNS resolutions, asset information, service paths, alarm information, certificate reports, and chassis manager temperatures).  The file was updated at 11:24:48 AM, 11:37:44 AM, 11:37:55 AM, 11:38:05 AM, and 12:02:58 PM.  Later updates improve error handling within the `parseChassisManagerTemperatures` function by using a try-catch block to handle potential JSON parsing exceptions.  A `std::move` was added in one version to improve efficiency.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`: This file implements the `ChassisMonitor` class, responsible for fetching chassis temperature data and thresholds from a chassis manager via a Unix socket (`./chassis-manager.sock`).  It updates the state with the temperature information and raises alarms if thresholds are exceeded.  Changes in this file happened at 11:25:05 AM and 12:01:55 PM. The later update simply added a comment to clarify the path of the chassis manager socket. The code consistently uses the `dolly::dynamic` JSON library for data handling.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateDataParserTest.cpp`:  This file contains unit tests for `StateDataParser`, focusing on the `parseChassisManagerTemperatures` function.  It tests different temperature scenarios (safe, high, critical, and shutdown) and a bad JSON input case. The  tests were updated at 11:39:39 AM, 11:51:51 AM and 12:03:06 PM. The final update changed the expectation for the bad JSON input case to correctly reflect that the `resultMap` will have size 0 instead of 2.


A recurring theme across the code is the extensive use of the `dolly` library for JSON parsing and manipulation.  The `statePathInfo` structure is also consistently used for passing state information between different parts of the code.  The updates reveal a focus on improving error handling and refining the alarm logic, particularly concerning chassis temperature monitoring.


## 1:16:07 PM
The code changes primarily involve the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` file, undergoing several revisions between 1:14:05 PM and 1:15:14 PM on June 18th, 2025.  These revisions focused on refining the implementation for fetching and processing chassis temperature and threshold data.  The most significant change involved resolving a merge conflict related to the path for the Unix socket (`"./chassis-manager.sock"`).  The final version consistently uses this path.

The `ChassisMonitor` class was implemented to fetch temperature and temperature thresholds from a chassis manager (likely via a Unix socket at `/var/run/128technology/chassis-manager.sock` and an HTTP endpoint `http://localhost/api/v1/chassis/temperature` or  `http://localhost/api/v1/chassis/temperature/threshold`), send this data to a state object, and raise alarms based on the values.  Error handling was added to manage situations where the chassis manager is unreachable, incorporating retry logic with a timeout of 20 seconds.  The code also includes JSON parsing and logging using a `dolly` library and custom logging functions (`TraceLog`, `WarningLog`, `DebugLog`).

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` file was updated at 1:15:38 PM on June 18th, 2025. This file handles system-level state changes and triggers alarms based on various conditions, including CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space, and NTP server status.  This class extensively uses the `dolly` library for JSON parsing and manipulation.  The `SystemChangeHandler` registers many functions to handle different types of state changes.  It also has added logic to handle CPU usage alarms and thresholds, and it includes detailed logic for managing alarms related to NTP servers, disk space, and connections.  Specific thresholds (e.g., `memoryUsageThreshold`, `cpuUsageTriggerThreshold`, `diskSpaceUsageTriggerThreshold`) are used to determine the severity of the alarms.

Finally, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp` shows unit tests for the `SystemChangeHandler`, verifying its functionality across various scenarios, particularly focusing on version mismatch, CPU usage, and other system events.  These tests use helper functions to create expected alarm objects for comparison with the actual generated alarms. The tests extensively exercise different states and conditions to validate the alarm generation and clearing mechanisms.


## 2:16:22 PM
The log shows multiple code changes across several files within a system monitoring application, primarily focusing on chassis temperature monitoring and alarm handling.  Significant changes occurred between 1:16 PM and 2:13 PM on June 18, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp`: This file was updated at 1:16:21 PM.  The update involved adding a `StateDataParser` class responsible for parsing various types of state data (CPU utilization, disk utilization, connection status, process events, DNS resolutions, asset information, alarm information, certificate reports, and chassis manager temperatures) from JSON strings into a standardized map.  The parser uses the `dolly::json` library for JSON parsing.  Multiple `parse` functions handle different data types, and a `defaultParser` handles unknown data types.  A recurring pattern is the use of `dolly::parseJson` and the population of a `resultMap` with parsed data.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateDataParserTest.cpp`: This file, updated at 1:16:30 PM and again at 1:20:52 PM and 1:24:45 PM, contains unit tests for the `StateDataParser`.  The initial update focused on testing the `parseChassisManagerTemperatures` function, covering various temperature scenarios (safe, high, critical, and shutdown).  Later updates likely added more comprehensive testing.  The use of the Google Test framework (`gtest`) is evident.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`: This file underwent substantial changes between 1:18:58 PM and 2:13:26 PM.  The code manages chassis temperature monitoring, fetching data from a chassis manager via a Unix socket (`./chassis-manager.sock`).  The code makes HTTP requests to `/api/v1/chassis/temperature` and `/api/v1/chassis/temperature/threshold` endpoints using the `curl` library. It parses JSON responses and updates the application state accordingly, including setting a disconnected flag if communication with the chassis manager fails after multiple retries. The major changes throughout this file's updates involve improving the robustness of the chassis temperature handling by adding retry logic and refining error handling.  A significant change around 2:00 PM introduced a `handleChassisHeartbeat` function to check the health of the SSR by examining the presence of Major or Critical alarms in the `stateObjects.getAlarmTable()`.  The implementation was significantly improved for efficiency, avoiding redundant parsing after finding a Major or Critical alarm. The code also changed from using `alarm::AlarmTable` to `state::AlarmTable`, and the type of the alarm in the for_each loop changed from `extensible::Alarm` to `state::extensible::Alarm`.  Finally, the method of checking for critical alarms shifted from iterating through the alarms to use a `hasMajorOrCriticalAlarms()` helper function.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp`: This file, updated at 1:20:32 PM and 1:24:22 PM, contains a `SystemChangeHandler` class that processes state changes and generates alarms based on predefined thresholds.  The class registers handlers for various system events, such as memory and disk usage, CPU utilization, and NTP server status.  It uses the `dolly::json` library for JSON parsing and the `AlarmFactory` to create alarms.  The updates likely involved adding new alarm handling logic or refining existing handlers.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/test/SystemChangeHandlerTest.cpp`: Updated at 1:20:40 PM and 1:24:31 PM, this file contains unit tests for the `SystemChangeHandler`. The tests cover various alarm scenarios, focusing on CPU usage, software version mismatches, and other system events.  The tests use the Google Test framework and helper functions to simplify test creation.


In summary, the code changes reflect ongoing development and testing of a system monitoring component. The focus is on improving the reliability and accuracy of chassis temperature monitoring,  enhancing alarm handling, and adding more comprehensive testing.  The use of the `dolly` library for JSON manipulation and the Google Test framework for unit testing is consistent throughout the project.


## 3:16:13 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp` file between 6/18/2025, 2:43:56 PM and 6/18/2025, 3:15:31 PM.  These changes primarily focus on enhancing the `testChassisHeartbeat` function within the `ChassisMonitorTest` class.  Initially, this function contained a single TODO comment.  Subsequent updates progressively added test cases to cover various scenarios:  a healthy chassis (no alarms), a chassis with minor alarms, and finally,  chassis states with major and critical alarms.  The tests utilize  `alarmTable` to simulate different alarm conditions and verify the `handleChassisHeartbeat` function's response accordingly.  The expected responses include a "healthy" boolean and a "reason" string, reflecting the chassis health.   The additions also include assertions to check the HTTP response code (`http::Code::Ok`).

A noteworthy change involved the inclusion of  `#include <state/test/StateClient.hpp>` in `ChassisMonitorTest.cpp`, suggesting an integration with a testing framework for state management.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateTest.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateClient.hpp` files were also modified during this period. These changes appear related to the setup and verification of various states within a testing environment, likely linked to the alarm handling in `ChassisMonitorTest.cpp`.  The `StateTest.cpp` file includes a broad range of state-related classes, indicating comprehensive testing of the state management system. The `StateClient.hpp` file defines a `StateClient` class, used to manage and interact with persistent data, which is likely being used for state management within the tests.  The updates to `StateClient.hpp` involved a namespace adjustment to `state::test`.  The final modifications in `StateTest.cpp`  indicate the addition of more extensive verification checks for local states.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.hpp` file was updated once at 6/18/2025, 2:36:50 PM. This update shows the header file for the `ChassisMonitor` class, indicating its functionality involves fetching and parsing temperature thresholds and temperatures from a chassis, writing this information to a state object and handling heartbeats.  The class uses several external libraries, including `curl` for HTTP communication and `dolly` for JSON handling.  The class is designed to prevent copy and move semantics.


## 4:16:06 PM
The log shows a series of code changes primarily focused on the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateClient.hpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp` files between 3:16 PM and 4:14 PM on June 18th, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateClient.hpp`: This file underwent multiple revisions.  The core changes involved refining the `StateClient` class, specifically its member `procName`. Initially, `procName` was implicitly defined within the class. Subsequent edits explicitly declared `procName` as a `const std::string` initialized to `"testApp"`. Additionally, the return type of `getObjects()` was changed from `state::TestObjects&` to `state::test::TestObjects&` to reflect the namespace correctly.  These modifications suggest a focus on improving code clarity, consistency, and correctness.  The inclusion of `<util/ChangeNotifier.hpp>` indicates the use of a change notification mechanism within the `StateClient`.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp`: This file contains unit tests for a `ChassisMonitor`.  A significant change at 4:06:46 PM introduced a timeout parameter  `get()` in the `handleChassisHeartbeat()` method within the `testChassisHeartbeat` test case. This change might be related to improving the robustness of the test by explicitly managing the wait time for a response.  The test suite itself extensively uses the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON manipulation, suggesting a system where data is exchanged in JSON format. The tests cover various scenarios, including initialization, handling of temperature data (with and without thresholds), and the monitoring of alarms which impact the 'healthy' status of the system. The addition of `EXPECT_BECOMES_EQ(1, getEventCount());` in the `testChassisHeartbeat` function suggests an attempt to track or verify events related to the system's heartbeat.


## 5:16:07 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of four files across the afternoon of June 18th, 2025.  The most significant changes involve `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateClient.hpp` which underwent five revisions between 4:18 PM and 4:49 PM.  These revisions primarily focused on code refactoring and minor cleanup.  Specifically, the namespace declaration for `state::test::TestObjects` was modified to `state::TestObjects`, simplifying the code.  A small syntax error was also corrected in the  `preDestructor` method.  The overall structure and functionality of the `StateClient` class remained consistent throughout these updates.


The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateTest.cpp` was updated once at 4:19 PM. This file contains extensive test code using various classes and functions related to state management, including components for assets, alarms, interfaces and nodes. It uses the `dolly` library for JSON handling and `gtest` for testing.

The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp` was revised four times between 4:53 PM and 5:11 PM. These revisions primarily involved changes to the `testChassisHeartbeat` test case within the `ChassisMonitorTest` class. The changes  focused on improving the test's logic by correctly adding and removing alarms to accurately reflect the system's health status.  The initial version of the test used `alarmTable` whereas the final version utilizes `alarmSourceTable` and `alarmTable`.  The test verifies the correct handling of alarms of different severities (minor, major, critical) to determine the overall health of the system.


The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` shows a single update at 5:09 PM. This file's update pertains to the implementation of a `ChassisMonitor` class, which seems to be responsible for monitoring chassis temperatures and heartbeats. It uses a Unix socket to interact with a `chassis-manager` service and handles the parsing of JSON responses.  The primary functional change was the addition of  `alarmSourceTable` for managing alarm sources to the `handleChassisHeartbeat` method.

In summary, the code changes reflect iterative development and testing, with a focus on refining state management and monitoring functionality, primarily involving alarm handling and chassis temperature monitoring.  The updates were mostly minor refinements, error corrections, and improvements to testing.
