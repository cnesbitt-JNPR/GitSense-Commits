# Activity Summary for 6/18/2025

## 10:16:06 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` on June 18th, 2025.  The file is concerned with monitoring chassis temperatures.  The initial version (9:54:43 AM) establishes the foundation for fetching and parsing temperature data and thresholds from a chassis manager via a Unix socket and HTTP requests to "http://localhost/api/v1/chassis/temperature" and "http://localhost/api/v1/chassis/temperature/threshold". It includes functions to handle HTTP responses, parse JSON data, and update the application state with the collected information.  Error handling is implemented to manage network issues and invalid JSON responses. A `consecutiveFailureCount` is used to track consecutive failures.

Subsequent revisions (9:56:22 AM, 9:59:15 AM, and 9:59:28 AM) primarily focus on refining the error handling for fetching chassis temperatures.  Specifically, the major change is the introduction of `retriesUntilDisconnected`, a constant representing the number of consecutive failed attempts before marking the chassis manager as disconnected (set to 20, implying 20 seconds).  The magic number 20 was later explicitly documented as 20 seconds.  The code remains functionally similar throughout the revisions, with the core logic for fetching, parsing, and updating temperature data unchanged.  The final version (9:59:28 AM) includes a well-defined constant for retries instead of a magic number in the code.  There are also several `//TODO` comments that indicate areas needing further development, notably the `handleChassisHeartbeat` function. The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp` file, on the other hand, is updated only once (9:34:15 AM) and it's a much larger file, this file appears to be a comprehensive state data parser responsible for handling various data types (CPU utilization, disk utilization, configuration node utilization, connection status, peer path status, process events, DNS resolutions, asset information, service path status, alarm information, certificate reports, and chassis manager temperatures) and populating a `ParsedStateDataMap`.  The parsing functions extensively use the `dolly::dynamic` and `dolly::json` libraries for JSON manipulation.


## 11:16:07 AM
The log shows multiple code changes across two files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/alarm/SystemChangeHandler.cpp` underwent several revisions between 10:36 AM and 11:14 AM on June 18th, 2025.  These changes appear to be minor edits and do not reflect substantial functional alterations to the code.  The core logic for handling system changes and generating alarms remains consistent across these revisions.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` was modified between 11:04 AM and 11:12 AM on June 18th, 2025. The most significant change is in `parseChassisResponseJson` function at 11:11:45 AM, where the check for HTTP status code changed from `response.statusCode != 200` to `response.statusCode != http::Code::Ok`, suggesting a potential improvement in error handling by using a more descriptive enum. Another noteworthy change involved adding `assert(pNode != nullptr)` in  `writeTemperatureInfoToState` and `writeTemperatureInfoUnavailable` functions at 11:04:43 AM and 11:05:12 AM respectively, improving robustness by explicitly checking for null pointers.  The file focuses on monitoring chassis temperatures, fetching data, parsing JSON responses, and updating the application state accordingly.  There is a consistent pattern of fetching data from a chassis manager via a Unix socket, parsing JSON responses, and writing the resulting data to the application state.  A retry mechanism is implemented to handle potential connection issues with the chassis manager.
