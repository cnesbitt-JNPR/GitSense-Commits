# Activity Summary for 6/23/2025

## 2:16:03 PM
The log shows three consecutive updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateEnums.hpp` on June 23, 2025.  The changes between each version are minor and insignificant; the code remains functionally identical across all three timestamps.  The file defines a series of enums using the `ENUM_FACTORY_DECLARE_ENUM` and `ENUM_FACTORY_DECLARE_ENUM_STRING` macros, likely for representing various states within a system.  These enums cover a wide range of statuses, including interface states (administrative, operational, provisional, VRRP, redundancy, and duplex), categories for alarms and events, peer connection statuses (including security and MTU discovery), asset statuses, SNMP agent status, and certificate-related statuses.  The timestamps indicate rapid, possibly iterative, development or testing around 1:33 PM, 1:58 PM, and 2:00 PM on the specified date.  No substantive code changes are observed between the revisions.


## 5:16:07 PM
The log shows development of a Chassis Manager's LED control system in Go.  Significant changes occurred between 4:41 PM and 5:06 PM on June 23, 2025.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/blink_codes.go` (4:43:00 PM):** This file defines LED blink codes (`Booting`, `Heartbeat`), laying the groundwork for representing different system states.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/led.go` (4:43:38 PM, 4:57:05 PM, 5:01:22 PM, 5:02:19 PM):** This file contains the core LED manager.  Initial commits focused on setting up a `Manager` struct with a work queue (`queue.Queue[UpdateRequest]`) for handling LED updates.  A `ledStatus` map was added (4:57:05 PM) to track the LED status for different senders. A  `Run` function is outlined, along with a `ProcessLEDUpdates` function to dequeue and process update batches with error handling.  The `//todo` comments suggest further implementation is needed for setting initial LED states, handling saved states, and completing the main loop.   The `Run` function had a `//todo: set LED state to "BOOTING"` comment removed at 5:02:19 PM.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/BUILD.bazel` (4:44:50 PM):** This Bazel build file defines the Go library for the `led` package, listing dependencies on `api`, `queue`, and `log` packages.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/api/api.go` (4:51:13 PM, 4:51:21 PM, 4:51:37 PM, 4:52:47 PM):** This file defines the API for interacting with the Chassis Manager.  It includes constants for socket path and log directory, enums for `LedSender` (SSR, MistAgent) and `LedStatus` (initially only `UnknownStatus` and `ClearStatus`, then changed to `UnknownStatus` and `ClearBlinkCode`, then finally  `UnknownStatus` and `ClearBlinkCode`). Multiple nearly identical commits suggest experimentation or iterative refinement of the  `LedStatus` enum.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go` (4:58:52 PM, 5:00:40 PM, 5:01:06 PM, 5:01:14 PM, 5:04:41 PM, 5:06:47 PM):** This file introduces a `HeartbeatMonitor` to periodically check system health. The `HeartbeatHealth` enum evolves from initial simple states to include `Booting`, `InService`, `DegradedService`, and `OutOfService`.  The structure of the monitor is refined and a  `HeartbeatMonitor` struct is created.

In summary, the code evolves from defining basic LED states and an API, to creating a more complex LED manager that uses a work queue and tracks LED status per sender.  A heartbeat monitoring mechanism is also added to check system health.  Many TODOs remain, indicating ongoing development.  The repeated commits to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/api/api.go` show iterative design of the LedStatus enum.


## 6:16:05 PM
The log shows development activity focused on the `ChassisManager` application, specifically its LED management component.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/app/app.go` file, updated at 6/23/2025, 5:16:42 PM, represents the main application logic, initializing various managers (including the LED manager) and managing their concurrent execution.

The majority of changes center around `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/led.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go`.  Multiple updates to `led.go` between 6/23/2025, 5:24:32 PM and 6/23/2025, 5:35:08 PM refine the `Manager` struct, primarily changing the type of `ledStatus` and `heartbeatMonitor` members from map and struct to pointer types.  This suggests a refactoring effort to improve memory management or enable more dynamic behavior. The `ProcessLEDUpdates` function is partially implemented, showing the use of a queue for batch processing of LED updates with specific timeout and poll interval settings.

The `heartbeat.go` file, introduced at 6/23/2025, 5:32:29 PM, defines a `HeartbeatMonitor` to check system health.  Subsequent updates (until 6/23/2025, 5:34:32 PM) correct the type definition of `HeartbeatHealth` and fix minor issues in the `HeartbeatMonitor` constructor. Finally,  `led.go` is updated at 6/23/2025, 5:35:08 PM to use the newly created `NewHeartbeatMonitor` function.

The `BUILD.bazel` file, updated at 6/23/2025, 5:29:52 PM, reflects the addition of `heartbeat.go` to the LED library's build definition.  This signifies the integration of the heartbeat monitoring functionality into the LED management module.  Overall, the changes demonstrate iterative development, focusing on improving the structure and functionality of LED and heartbeat management within the Chassis Manager application.
