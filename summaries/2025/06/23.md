# Activity Summary for 6/23/2025

## 2:16:03 PM
The log shows three consecutive updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/StateEnums.hpp` on June 23, 2025.  The changes between each version are minor and insignificant; the code remains functionally identical across all three timestamps.  The file defines a series of enums using the `ENUM_FACTORY_DECLARE_ENUM` and `ENUM_FACTORY_DECLARE_ENUM_STRING` macros, likely for representing various states within a system.  These enums cover a wide range of statuses, including interface states (administrative, operational, provisional, VRRP, redundancy, and duplex), categories for alarms and events, peer connection statuses (including security and MTU discovery), asset statuses, SNMP agent status, and certificate-related statuses.  The timestamps indicate rapid, possibly iterative, development or testing around 1:33 PM, 1:58 PM, and 2:00 PM on the specified date.  No substantive code changes are observed between the revisions.
