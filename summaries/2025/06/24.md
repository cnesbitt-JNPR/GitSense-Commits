# Activity Summary for 6/24/2025

## 12:15:49 PM
The log shows development of a Go program managing system LEDs, specifically focusing on a heartbeat monitor component.  The `heartbeat.go` file underwent substantial changes between 11:16 AM and 12:14 PM.  Initially, the `HeartbeatMonitor` structure was rudimentary,  with only a `health` field.  The `Run` function was initially empty, then evolved into a main loop with a sleep interval, initially 25 milliseconds, then changed to 3 seconds.  Importantly, the `Run` function's receiver was changed from `manager` to `monitor`.  Between 11:52 AM and 12:14 PM, significant improvements were made:

*   **Heartbeat Initialization:**  An initialization loop was added to the `Run` function to establish the heartbeat with a grace period.  This loop attempts to fetch the SSR health status repeatedly until a healthy status (InService or DegradedService) is received or the maximum number of attempts is reached.  `monitor.checkInterval` (initially 3 seconds)  determines the retry interval and the total grace period.  The code added logging messages for successful initialization and failure after multiple attempts.

*   **`HeartbeatHealth` Enum:** An enum (`HeartbeatHealth`) defining system health states (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService) was consistently used throughout the changes.

*   **Error Handling:** The initialization loop now includes proper error handling and logging for failed heartbeat initialization.

*   **Health Update Function:** A separate `updateHeartbeat` function was created to update the `monitor.health` based on `fetchSsrHealth`.


The `led.go` file was modified between 11:29 AM and 11:33 AM.  These changes primarily focused on the `Manager` structure and the `processRequestQueue` function. The `ledStatus` map in the `Manager` struct was renamed to `ledRequestStatus`. A `processRequestQueue` function was added to handle dequeuing batches of update requests from a work queue using configurable parameters (`MaxBatch`, `PollInterval`, `Timeout`). Error handling was also introduced to manage the case where the queue is closed. The sleep interval within the main loop remained at 25 milliseconds.  The `processLED` function remained largely untouched, marked with TODO comments.


## 1:15:48 PM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go` file underwent several revisions between 12:16 PM and 12:34 PM on June 24, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was the implementation of a heartbeat monitor that checks the health of an SSR system.

Initially, the code lacked error handling and  a clear reconnection strategy.  The `heartbeatChecker` function was introduced, managing connection attempts with `maxInitializationAttempts` and `maxReconnectionAttempts` constants set to 20 and 3 respectively. The `heartbeatChecker` function was initially called  `heartbeatInitializer` in a slightly incorrect way. This was corrected in subsequent commits.  The `heartbeatChecker` function was improved to reset the attempt counter after both successful and unsuccessful attempts.


A significant change around 12:24 PM involved adding the `net/http` package and implementing a basic HTTP client to fetch the SSR health. This client is configured to use a Unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock`)  for communication. The final commit at 12:34 PM refactored the error logging within `fetchSsrHealth` to use the `log` package consistently. The `fetchSsrHealth` function remains incomplete in all versions, indicated by `// todo` or an empty implementation.  The sleep time in the main loop was changed from `3 * time.Second` to `checkInterval` to maintain consistency.  A `shutdown` function was added  with a TODO comment for future implementation.


## 2:15:51 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go` file between 1:26 PM and 2:14 PM on June 24, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: a heartbeat monitor that checks the health of an SSR system via a Unix socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock` at the endpoint `/api/v1/chassis/heartbeat` and updates the system's health status accordingly.

The key changes across the revisions are focused on the `fetchSsrHealth` and `parseResponse` functions:


* **Initial Version (1:26 PM):** The initial version contained a placeholder `fetchSsrHealth` function that was incomplete, lacking actual HTTP request handling and response processing.

* **Improved Request Handling (1:36 PM):** This revision introduced a functional `fetchSsrHealth` function. It now makes a GET request to the NodeMonitor via a Unix socket, handling errors and returning `OutOfService` with error messages.  However, response processing was still rudimentary, printing the response body without parsing.

* **Refactoring and JSON Parsing (1:39 PM - 1:53 PM):**  Several commits focused on refactoring `fetchSsrHealth`  to separate the response processing. A `parseResponse` function was introduced, and the code was modified to parse the JSON response from NodeMonitor, looking for a field named `"status"` or `"healthy"` to determine system health.  There were adjustments to how `isHealthy` was used to determine the state in the `parseResponse` function. The `json` package was added to the imports in one of these commits(1:58 PM).

* **Error Handling Improvements (1:57 PM - 2:14 PM):** Subsequent commits refined error handling.  The `fetchSsrHealth` function now uses `log.Errorf` and `log.Warnf`  to provide more informative logging for `OutOfService` and `DegradedService` statuses.  Error handling improved in `fetchSsrHealth` by directly returning errors from the lower level instead of processing.  Unnecessary functions were removed. The final version (2:14 PM)  provides a clear and concise implementation with robust error handling and informative logging.  The JSON key for indicating healthy status was changed from `"status"` to `"healthy"`.

Throughout the modifications, the core structure of the `HeartbeatMonitor` and `heartbeatChecker` functions remained largely unchanged, indicating a focus on improving the accuracy and robustness of the health check mechanism. The `checkInterval` of 3 seconds, `maxInitializationAttempts` of 20, and `maxReconnectionAttempts` of 3 remained constant.
