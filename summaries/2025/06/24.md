# Activity Summary for 6/24/2025

## 12:15:49 PM
The log shows development of a Go program managing system LEDs, specifically focusing on a heartbeat monitor component.  The `heartbeat.go` file underwent substantial changes between 11:16 AM and 12:14 PM.  Initially, the `HeartbeatMonitor` structure was rudimentary,  with only a `health` field.  The `Run` function was initially empty, then evolved into a main loop with a sleep interval, initially 25 milliseconds, then changed to 3 seconds.  Importantly, the `Run` function's receiver was changed from `manager` to `monitor`.  Between 11:52 AM and 12:14 PM, significant improvements were made:

*   **Heartbeat Initialization:**  An initialization loop was added to the `Run` function to establish the heartbeat with a grace period.  This loop attempts to fetch the SSR health status repeatedly until a healthy status (InService or DegradedService) is received or the maximum number of attempts is reached.  `monitor.checkInterval` (initially 3 seconds)  determines the retry interval and the total grace period.  The code added logging messages for successful initialization and failure after multiple attempts.

*   **`HeartbeatHealth` Enum:** An enum (`HeartbeatHealth`) defining system health states (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService) was consistently used throughout the changes.

*   **Error Handling:** The initialization loop now includes proper error handling and logging for failed heartbeat initialization.

*   **Health Update Function:** A separate `updateHeartbeat` function was created to update the `monitor.health` based on `fetchSsrHealth`.


The `led.go` file was modified between 11:29 AM and 11:33 AM.  These changes primarily focused on the `Manager` structure and the `processRequestQueue` function. The `ledStatus` map in the `Manager` struct was renamed to `ledRequestStatus`. A `processRequestQueue` function was added to handle dequeuing batches of update requests from a work queue using configurable parameters (`MaxBatch`, `PollInterval`, `Timeout`). Error handling was also introduced to manage the case where the queue is closed. The sleep interval within the main loop remained at 25 milliseconds.  The `processLED` function remained largely untouched, marked with TODO comments.


## 1:15:48 PM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go` file underwent several revisions between 12:16 PM and 12:34 PM on June 24, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was the implementation of a heartbeat monitor that checks the health of an SSR system.

Initially, the code lacked error handling and  a clear reconnection strategy.  The `heartbeatChecker` function was introduced, managing connection attempts with `maxInitializationAttempts` and `maxReconnectionAttempts` constants set to 20 and 3 respectively. The `heartbeatChecker` function was initially called  `heartbeatInitializer` in a slightly incorrect way. This was corrected in subsequent commits.  The `heartbeatChecker` function was improved to reset the attempt counter after both successful and unsuccessful attempts.


A significant change around 12:24 PM involved adding the `net/http` package and implementing a basic HTTP client to fetch the SSR health. This client is configured to use a Unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock`)  for communication. The final commit at 12:34 PM refactored the error logging within `fetchSsrHealth` to use the `log` package consistently. The `fetchSsrHealth` function remains incomplete in all versions, indicated by `// todo` or an empty implementation.  The sleep time in the main loop was changed from `3 * time.Second` to `checkInterval` to maintain consistency.  A `shutdown` function was added  with a TODO comment for future implementation.


## 2:15:51 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go` file between 1:26 PM and 2:14 PM on June 24, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: a heartbeat monitor that checks the health of an SSR system via a Unix socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock` at the endpoint `/api/v1/chassis/heartbeat` and updates the system's health status accordingly.

The key changes across the revisions are focused on the `fetchSsrHealth` and `parseResponse` functions:


* **Initial Version (1:26 PM):** The initial version contained a placeholder `fetchSsrHealth` function that was incomplete, lacking actual HTTP request handling and response processing.

* **Improved Request Handling (1:36 PM):** This revision introduced a functional `fetchSsrHealth` function. It now makes a GET request to the NodeMonitor via a Unix socket, handling errors and returning `OutOfService` with error messages.  However, response processing was still rudimentary, printing the response body without parsing.

* **Refactoring and JSON Parsing (1:39 PM - 1:53 PM):**  Several commits focused on refactoring `fetchSsrHealth`  to separate the response processing. A `parseResponse` function was introduced, and the code was modified to parse the JSON response from NodeMonitor, looking for a field named `"status"` or `"healthy"` to determine system health.  There were adjustments to how `isHealthy` was used to determine the state in the `parseResponse` function. The `json` package was added to the imports in one of these commits(1:58 PM).

* **Error Handling Improvements (1:57 PM - 2:14 PM):** Subsequent commits refined error handling.  The `fetchSsrHealth` function now uses `log.Errorf` and `log.Warnf`  to provide more informative logging for `OutOfService` and `DegradedService` statuses.  Error handling improved in `fetchSsrHealth` by directly returning errors from the lower level instead of processing.  Unnecessary functions were removed. The final version (2:14 PM)  provides a clear and concise implementation with robust error handling and informative logging.  The JSON key for indicating healthy status was changed from `"status"` to `"healthy"`.

Throughout the modifications, the core structure of the `HeartbeatMonitor` and `heartbeatChecker` functions remained largely unchanged, indicating a focus on improving the accuracy and robustness of the health check mechanism. The `checkInterval` of 3 seconds, `maxInitializationAttempts` of 20, and `maxReconnectionAttempts` of 3 remained constant.


## 3:15:51 PM
The log shows development of `heartbeat.go` and `led.go` files within a Go project related to LED management in a chassis manager.  The primary focus is creating a heartbeat monitor that checks the system health and updates LEDs accordingly.

**heartbeat.go:** This file implements a heartbeat monitor that periodically checks the system health using a Unix socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock` and the endpoint `/api/v1/chassis/heartbeat`.  The health status is categorized into `Booting`, `InService`, `DegradedService`, and `OutOfService`.  Significant changes occurred between 2:30:16 PM and 2:33:37 PM, where the code was refined to improve the heartbeat initialization and reconnection logic.  The final version clarifies the loop structure for establishing and maintaining the heartbeat, enhancing readability.

**led.go:** This file manages LED updates based on system health and user requests.  The `Manager` struct holds the LED management state, including a work queue (`workQueue`), a map for blink codes (`blinkCodes`), and a `heartbeatMonitor`.  The initial versions (2:24:30 PM, 2:24:59 PM, 2:28:01 PM, 2:28:22 PM) show a gradual development of the LED management logic, with the main loop remaining incomplete, and much of the functionality commented out as `TODO`. The `processSystemLED` function was introduced to handle system LED updates based on the heartbeat.  A significant change at 2:56:05 PM introduces concurrency using `sync.WaitGroup` and `context.CancelFunc` to manage the heartbeat monitor as a goroutine. Subsequent changes (2:57:15 PM, 3:01:16 PM, 3:10:44 PM, 3:11:36 PM, 3:12:34 PM, 3:12:41 PM, 3:12:51 PM, 3:14:02 PM, 3:14:15 PM, 3:14:47 PM, 3:15:08 PM, 3:15:14 PM) primarily focus on refining the concurrency model and cleaning up the code, particularly  how the heartbeat monitor is started and stopped.  The final version ensures proper context management and goroutine synchronization, with the `sync.WaitGroup` used to wait for the heartbeat goroutine to complete before exiting.  The `processSystemLED` function's logic is simplified, and the code structure is improved for readability.  The `sync` package was added to manage concurrent processes correctly, highlighting a move towards robust error handling and process management.  The consistent use of `TODO` comments throughout indicates ongoing development and planned features.
