# Activity Summary for 6/24/2025

## 12:15:49 PM
The log shows development of a Go program managing system LEDs, specifically focusing on a heartbeat monitor component.  The `heartbeat.go` file underwent substantial changes between 11:16 AM and 12:14 PM.  Initially, the `HeartbeatMonitor` structure was rudimentary,  with only a `health` field.  The `Run` function was initially empty, then evolved into a main loop with a sleep interval, initially 25 milliseconds, then changed to 3 seconds.  Importantly, the `Run` function's receiver was changed from `manager` to `monitor`.  Between 11:52 AM and 12:14 PM, significant improvements were made:

*   **Heartbeat Initialization:**  An initialization loop was added to the `Run` function to establish the heartbeat with a grace period.  This loop attempts to fetch the SSR health status repeatedly until a healthy status (InService or DegradedService) is received or the maximum number of attempts is reached.  `monitor.checkInterval` (initially 3 seconds)  determines the retry interval and the total grace period.  The code added logging messages for successful initialization and failure after multiple attempts.

*   **`HeartbeatHealth` Enum:** An enum (`HeartbeatHealth`) defining system health states (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService) was consistently used throughout the changes.

*   **Error Handling:** The initialization loop now includes proper error handling and logging for failed heartbeat initialization.

*   **Health Update Function:** A separate `updateHeartbeat` function was created to update the `monitor.health` based on `fetchSsrHealth`.


The `led.go` file was modified between 11:29 AM and 11:33 AM.  These changes primarily focused on the `Manager` structure and the `processRequestQueue` function. The `ledStatus` map in the `Manager` struct was renamed to `ledRequestStatus`. A `processRequestQueue` function was added to handle dequeuing batches of update requests from a work queue using configurable parameters (`MaxBatch`, `PollInterval`, `Timeout`). Error handling was also introduced to manage the case where the queue is closed. The sleep interval within the main loop remained at 25 milliseconds.  The `processLED` function remained largely untouched, marked with TODO comments.


## 1:15:48 PM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go` file underwent several revisions between 12:16 PM and 12:34 PM on June 24, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was the implementation of a heartbeat monitor that checks the health of an SSR system.

Initially, the code lacked error handling and  a clear reconnection strategy.  The `heartbeatChecker` function was introduced, managing connection attempts with `maxInitializationAttempts` and `maxReconnectionAttempts` constants set to 20 and 3 respectively. The `heartbeatChecker` function was initially called  `heartbeatInitializer` in a slightly incorrect way. This was corrected in subsequent commits.  The `heartbeatChecker` function was improved to reset the attempt counter after both successful and unsuccessful attempts.


A significant change around 12:24 PM involved adding the `net/http` package and implementing a basic HTTP client to fetch the SSR health. This client is configured to use a Unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock`)  for communication. The final commit at 12:34 PM refactored the error logging within `fetchSsrHealth` to use the `log` package consistently. The `fetchSsrHealth` function remains incomplete in all versions, indicated by `// todo` or an empty implementation.  The sleep time in the main loop was changed from `3 * time.Second` to `checkInterval` to maintain consistency.  A `shutdown` function was added  with a TODO comment for future implementation.
