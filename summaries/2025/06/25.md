# Activity Summary for 6/25/2025

## 10:16:48 AM
The log shows development on a Chassis Manager's LED control system in Go.  The primary files are `led.go` and `heartbeat.go`.

`led.go` (first update 6/25/2025, 9:33:19 AM, last update 6/25/2025, 10:08:32 AM) manages LED updates using a queue (`queue.Queue[UpdateRequest]`) for handling requests.  Initial implementation focuses on a heartbeat monitor.  The code includes placeholders for future features like blink codes and loading LED state from a file.  A significant change at 10:08:32 AM was replacing `manager.workQueue.capacity` with `manager.workQueue.Capacity()` in the `processRequestQueue` function, likely for improved clarity and consistency.

`heartbeat.go` (multiple updates between 6/25/2025, 9:40:20 AM and 6/25/2025, 10:09:32 AM) implements a heartbeat monitor that checks SSR health at 3-second intervals.  The health status is represented by the `HeartbeatHealth` enum (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService).  Early versions used a custom Unix socket dialer; later updates switched to using `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/http/unix`.  A crucial change occurred around 9:54 AM, refactoring the `fetchSsrHealth` function into `makeHeartbeatRequest` and `handleHeartbeatResponse` for better modularity. Further updates between 10:01 AM and 10:09 AM improved logging and clarified function return types, specifically changing the `Response` type in `makeHeartbeatRequest` and `handleHeartbeatResponse` from a custom type to `*http.Response` for clarity and type safety.

`BUILD.bazel` (updated 6/25/2025, 10:02:55 AM and 6/25/2025, 10:03:33 AM) manages the build process. The dependency `//go/src/unix`  was replaced by `//go/src/http/unix` reflecting the change in the `heartbeat.go` file.

`queue.go` (updated 6/25/2025, 10:07:18 AM and 6/25/2025, 10:08:12 AM) implements a thread-safe bounded queue with batching capabilities.  The significant change is a renaming of `Capacity()` function. The  `Capacity()` function is added for clearer semantic meaning.

In summary, the development focused on building a robust heartbeat mechanism for monitoring SSR health, integrating it with a bounded queue for handling LED updates, and improving code clarity and structure throughout the files.  The evolution of the heartbeat functionality showcases iterative refinement and a move towards more structured code.


## 11:16:46 AM
The log shows iterative development of a Go program managing system LEDs.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/led.go` file underwent significant changes between 10:52 AM and 11:16 AM on June 25th, 2025.

Initially, the code was largely a placeholder, with many `TODO` comments indicating incomplete functionality.  Early versions focused on setting up a `Manager` struct to handle LED updates from a work queue, incorporating a `HeartbeatMonitor` for health checks.

Between 10:52 AM and 10:58 AM, the main changes involved refining the `Run` function to handle LED state persistence (from a file, defaulting to "Booting" if the file doesn't exist) and adding the `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed` function.

Further modifications between 10:58 AM and 11:16 AM focused on blink code handling.  The `Manager` struct gained a `lastBlinkCode` field, and new functions like `setBlinkCodeAsActiveLed`, `resolveActiveBlinkCode`, `saveBlinkCode`, and `clearBlinkCode` were introduced to manage blink codes, prioritizing them over heartbeat health.  The `resolveActiveBlinkCode` function is intended to determine the most critical blink code to display. The changes during this time focused on improving the logic for handling blink codes, ensuring they are processed before heartbeat checks, and adding functions to save and clear blink codes. The `processSystemLED` function was updated to prioritize blink code handling over heartbeat health updates.

A separate file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go`, was added at 11:08:30 AM. This file defines a `HeartbeatMonitor` that periodically checks the health of the SSR system using a unix socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock` and reports the status (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService). The heartbeat uses a retry mechanism to maintain connectivity.  Error handling and logging were included.

The overall pattern shows a progression from a basic framework to a more complete and robust system for managing LED status based on both system health and potentially more critical, event-driven blink codes.  Many functions remain as placeholders (`TODO`), suggesting that further implementation is required.
