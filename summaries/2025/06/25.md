# Activity Summary for 6/25/2025

## 10:16:48 AM
The log shows development on a Chassis Manager's LED control system in Go.  The primary files are `led.go` and `heartbeat.go`.

`led.go` (first update 6/25/2025, 9:33:19 AM, last update 6/25/2025, 10:08:32 AM) manages LED updates using a queue (`queue.Queue[UpdateRequest]`) for handling requests.  Initial implementation focuses on a heartbeat monitor.  The code includes placeholders for future features like blink codes and loading LED state from a file.  A significant change at 10:08:32 AM was replacing `manager.workQueue.capacity` with `manager.workQueue.Capacity()` in the `processRequestQueue` function, likely for improved clarity and consistency.

`heartbeat.go` (multiple updates between 6/25/2025, 9:40:20 AM and 6/25/2025, 10:09:32 AM) implements a heartbeat monitor that checks SSR health at 3-second intervals.  The health status is represented by the `HeartbeatHealth` enum (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService).  Early versions used a custom Unix socket dialer; later updates switched to using `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/http/unix`.  A crucial change occurred around 9:54 AM, refactoring the `fetchSsrHealth` function into `makeHeartbeatRequest` and `handleHeartbeatResponse` for better modularity. Further updates between 10:01 AM and 10:09 AM improved logging and clarified function return types, specifically changing the `Response` type in `makeHeartbeatRequest` and `handleHeartbeatResponse` from a custom type to `*http.Response` for clarity and type safety.

`BUILD.bazel` (updated 6/25/2025, 10:02:55 AM and 6/25/2025, 10:03:33 AM) manages the build process. The dependency `//go/src/unix`  was replaced by `//go/src/http/unix` reflecting the change in the `heartbeat.go` file.

`queue.go` (updated 6/25/2025, 10:07:18 AM and 6/25/2025, 10:08:12 AM) implements a thread-safe bounded queue with batching capabilities.  The significant change is a renaming of `Capacity()` function. The  `Capacity()` function is added for clearer semantic meaning.

In summary, the development focused on building a robust heartbeat mechanism for monitoring SSR health, integrating it with a bounded queue for handling LED updates, and improving code clarity and structure throughout the files.  The evolution of the heartbeat functionality showcases iterative refinement and a move towards more structured code.
