# Activity Summary for 6/25/2025

## 10:16:48 AM
The log shows development on a Chassis Manager's LED control system in Go.  The primary files are `led.go` and `heartbeat.go`.

`led.go` (first update 6/25/2025, 9:33:19 AM, last update 6/25/2025, 10:08:32 AM) manages LED updates using a queue (`queue.Queue[UpdateRequest]`) for handling requests.  Initial implementation focuses on a heartbeat monitor.  The code includes placeholders for future features like blink codes and loading LED state from a file.  A significant change at 10:08:32 AM was replacing `manager.workQueue.capacity` with `manager.workQueue.Capacity()` in the `processRequestQueue` function, likely for improved clarity and consistency.

`heartbeat.go` (multiple updates between 6/25/2025, 9:40:20 AM and 6/25/2025, 10:09:32 AM) implements a heartbeat monitor that checks SSR health at 3-second intervals.  The health status is represented by the `HeartbeatHealth` enum (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService).  Early versions used a custom Unix socket dialer; later updates switched to using `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/http/unix`.  A crucial change occurred around 9:54 AM, refactoring the `fetchSsrHealth` function into `makeHeartbeatRequest` and `handleHeartbeatResponse` for better modularity. Further updates between 10:01 AM and 10:09 AM improved logging and clarified function return types, specifically changing the `Response` type in `makeHeartbeatRequest` and `handleHeartbeatResponse` from a custom type to `*http.Response` for clarity and type safety.

`BUILD.bazel` (updated 6/25/2025, 10:02:55 AM and 6/25/2025, 10:03:33 AM) manages the build process. The dependency `//go/src/unix`  was replaced by `//go/src/http/unix` reflecting the change in the `heartbeat.go` file.

`queue.go` (updated 6/25/2025, 10:07:18 AM and 6/25/2025, 10:08:12 AM) implements a thread-safe bounded queue with batching capabilities.  The significant change is a renaming of `Capacity()` function. The  `Capacity()` function is added for clearer semantic meaning.

In summary, the development focused on building a robust heartbeat mechanism for monitoring SSR health, integrating it with a bounded queue for handling LED updates, and improving code clarity and structure throughout the files.  The evolution of the heartbeat functionality showcases iterative refinement and a move towards more structured code.


## 11:16:46 AM
The log shows iterative development of a Go program managing system LEDs.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/led.go` file underwent significant changes between 10:52 AM and 11:16 AM on June 25th, 2025.

Initially, the code was largely a placeholder, with many `TODO` comments indicating incomplete functionality.  Early versions focused on setting up a `Manager` struct to handle LED updates from a work queue, incorporating a `HeartbeatMonitor` for health checks.

Between 10:52 AM and 10:58 AM, the main changes involved refining the `Run` function to handle LED state persistence (from a file, defaulting to "Booting" if the file doesn't exist) and adding the `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed` function.

Further modifications between 10:58 AM and 11:16 AM focused on blink code handling.  The `Manager` struct gained a `lastBlinkCode` field, and new functions like `setBlinkCodeAsActiveLed`, `resolveActiveBlinkCode`, `saveBlinkCode`, and `clearBlinkCode` were introduced to manage blink codes, prioritizing them over heartbeat health.  The `resolveActiveBlinkCode` function is intended to determine the most critical blink code to display. The changes during this time focused on improving the logic for handling blink codes, ensuring they are processed before heartbeat checks, and adding functions to save and clear blink codes. The `processSystemLED` function was updated to prioritize blink code handling over heartbeat health updates.

A separate file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go`, was added at 11:08:30 AM. This file defines a `HeartbeatMonitor` that periodically checks the health of the SSR system using a unix socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock` and reports the status (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService). The heartbeat uses a retry mechanism to maintain connectivity.  Error handling and logging were included.

The overall pattern shows a progression from a basic framework to a more complete and robust system for managing LED status based on both system health and potentially more critical, event-driven blink codes.  Many functions remain as placeholders (`TODO`), suggesting that further implementation is required.


## 1:16:55 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/led.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/api/api.go` files between 11:16 AM and 12:08 PM on June 25, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the implementation of an LED manager within a Chassis Manager application.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/led.go` Updates:**

The `led.go` file undergoes extensive development.  Early versions contain numerous "TODO" comments indicating incomplete functionality, particularly around blink code handling (saving, loading, resolving active blink codes), LED status updates based on blink codes and heartbeat health, and queue processing.

Significant changes include:

* **11:16:55 AM:** Initial structure of the LED manager is established, including the `Manager` struct, `NewManager` function, and a basic `Run` function with a placeholder for a main loop.  The `processSystemLED` function is outlined, showing the intended logic for processing blink codes and heartbeat health.
* **11:17:30 AM - 11:18:57 AM:** Several commits refine the `resolveActiveBlinkCode` function, improving its logging and handling of edge cases.  The `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed` and `setBlinkCodeAsActiveLed` functions are adjusted. The `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed` function now accepts a `HeartbeatHealth` argument and includes a check for changes before updating the status.
* **11:20:02 AM - 11:20:45 AM:**  Further refinement of the `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed` function to prevent unnecessary updates when the heartbeat health hasn't changed.  Minor structural changes occur in `processSystemLED`.
* **11:20:45 AM - 11:25:51 AM:**  The `processSystemLED` function is simplified by removing redundant code.
* **11:28:29 AM:** The initial LED status in `NewManager` is set to `api.UnknownStatus` instead of `api.LedStatusUnknown`, aligning with the API.
* **11:28:44 AM:** The `setBlinkCodeAsActiveLed` function now correctly compares `blinkCode` with `manager.lastBlinkCode` instead of the global `lastBlinkCode`.
* **11:31:50 AM - 11:32:14 AM:** The `Run` function is significantly improved. The initial LED state is now loaded from persistent storage (`loadBlinkCode`). If no blink code is found, the heartbeat's initial health is used instead of `Booting`.
* **11:46:16 AM - 11:49:33 AM:** The `resolveActiveBlinkCode` function is updated to handle the case where `blinkCodes` has length > 0. The sleep time in the main loop is increased to 250 milliseconds.
* **11:53:18 AM - 11:56:44 AM:** The sleep time in the main loop is further increased to 1000 milliseconds. A log statement in `clearBlinkCode` is removed.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/api/api.go` Updates:**

The `api.go` file sees minor changes, mostly clarifying comments:

* **11:27:31 AM - 11:28:13 AM:** The comment for `ClearBlinkCode` in `LedStatus` is slightly modified to improve clarity.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Frequent updates to the `led.go` file suggest iterative development and debugging.
* Many functions have "TODO" comments, signifying ongoing development.
*  The code consistently uses the `log` package for logging various events, which is good practice for debugging and monitoring.
* A consistent pattern of checking for changes before updates in various functions(`setBlinkCodeAsActiveLed`, `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed`). This optimization prevents unnecessary actions.
* The sleep duration in the main loop of `led.go` is adjusted multiple times, potentially reflecting performance tuning or troubleshooting.


The overall evolution of the codebase shows a movement towards a more robust and refined LED management system.  The initial version was skeletal, but later commits fleshed out error handling, improved logic and added more precise checking to prevent unnecessary updates.
