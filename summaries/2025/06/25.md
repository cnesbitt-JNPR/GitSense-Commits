# Activity Summary for 6/25/2025

## 10:16:48 AM
The log shows development on a Chassis Manager's LED control system in Go.  The primary files are `led.go` and `heartbeat.go`.

`led.go` (first update 6/25/2025, 9:33:19 AM, last update 6/25/2025, 10:08:32 AM) manages LED updates using a queue (`queue.Queue[UpdateRequest]`) for handling requests.  Initial implementation focuses on a heartbeat monitor.  The code includes placeholders for future features like blink codes and loading LED state from a file.  A significant change at 10:08:32 AM was replacing `manager.workQueue.capacity` with `manager.workQueue.Capacity()` in the `processRequestQueue` function, likely for improved clarity and consistency.

`heartbeat.go` (multiple updates between 6/25/2025, 9:40:20 AM and 6/25/2025, 10:09:32 AM) implements a heartbeat monitor that checks SSR health at 3-second intervals.  The health status is represented by the `HeartbeatHealth` enum (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService).  Early versions used a custom Unix socket dialer; later updates switched to using `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/http/unix`.  A crucial change occurred around 9:54 AM, refactoring the `fetchSsrHealth` function into `makeHeartbeatRequest` and `handleHeartbeatResponse` for better modularity. Further updates between 10:01 AM and 10:09 AM improved logging and clarified function return types, specifically changing the `Response` type in `makeHeartbeatRequest` and `handleHeartbeatResponse` from a custom type to `*http.Response` for clarity and type safety.

`BUILD.bazel` (updated 6/25/2025, 10:02:55 AM and 6/25/2025, 10:03:33 AM) manages the build process. The dependency `//go/src/unix`  was replaced by `//go/src/http/unix` reflecting the change in the `heartbeat.go` file.

`queue.go` (updated 6/25/2025, 10:07:18 AM and 6/25/2025, 10:08:12 AM) implements a thread-safe bounded queue with batching capabilities.  The significant change is a renaming of `Capacity()` function. The  `Capacity()` function is added for clearer semantic meaning.

In summary, the development focused on building a robust heartbeat mechanism for monitoring SSR health, integrating it with a bounded queue for handling LED updates, and improving code clarity and structure throughout the files.  The evolution of the heartbeat functionality showcases iterative refinement and a move towards more structured code.


## 11:16:46 AM
The log shows iterative development of a Go program managing system LEDs.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/led.go` file underwent significant changes between 10:52 AM and 11:16 AM on June 25th, 2025.

Initially, the code was largely a placeholder, with many `TODO` comments indicating incomplete functionality.  Early versions focused on setting up a `Manager` struct to handle LED updates from a work queue, incorporating a `HeartbeatMonitor` for health checks.

Between 10:52 AM and 10:58 AM, the main changes involved refining the `Run` function to handle LED state persistence (from a file, defaulting to "Booting" if the file doesn't exist) and adding the `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed` function.

Further modifications between 10:58 AM and 11:16 AM focused on blink code handling.  The `Manager` struct gained a `lastBlinkCode` field, and new functions like `setBlinkCodeAsActiveLed`, `resolveActiveBlinkCode`, `saveBlinkCode`, and `clearBlinkCode` were introduced to manage blink codes, prioritizing them over heartbeat health.  The `resolveActiveBlinkCode` function is intended to determine the most critical blink code to display. The changes during this time focused on improving the logic for handling blink codes, ensuring they are processed before heartbeat checks, and adding functions to save and clear blink codes. The `processSystemLED` function was updated to prioritize blink code handling over heartbeat health updates.

A separate file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go`, was added at 11:08:30 AM. This file defines a `HeartbeatMonitor` that periodically checks the health of the SSR system using a unix socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock` and reports the status (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService). The heartbeat uses a retry mechanism to maintain connectivity.  Error handling and logging were included.

The overall pattern shows a progression from a basic framework to a more complete and robust system for managing LED status based on both system health and potentially more critical, event-driven blink codes.  Many functions remain as placeholders (`TODO`), suggesting that further implementation is required.


## 1:16:55 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/led.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/api/api.go` files between 11:16 AM and 12:08 PM on June 25, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the implementation of an LED manager within a Chassis Manager application.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/led.go` Updates:**

The `led.go` file undergoes extensive development.  Early versions contain numerous "TODO" comments indicating incomplete functionality, particularly around blink code handling (saving, loading, resolving active blink codes), LED status updates based on blink codes and heartbeat health, and queue processing.

Significant changes include:

* **11:16:55 AM:** Initial structure of the LED manager is established, including the `Manager` struct, `NewManager` function, and a basic `Run` function with a placeholder for a main loop.  The `processSystemLED` function is outlined, showing the intended logic for processing blink codes and heartbeat health.
* **11:17:30 AM - 11:18:57 AM:** Several commits refine the `resolveActiveBlinkCode` function, improving its logging and handling of edge cases.  The `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed` and `setBlinkCodeAsActiveLed` functions are adjusted. The `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed` function now accepts a `HeartbeatHealth` argument and includes a check for changes before updating the status.
* **11:20:02 AM - 11:20:45 AM:**  Further refinement of the `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed` function to prevent unnecessary updates when the heartbeat health hasn't changed.  Minor structural changes occur in `processSystemLED`.
* **11:20:45 AM - 11:25:51 AM:**  The `processSystemLED` function is simplified by removing redundant code.
* **11:28:29 AM:** The initial LED status in `NewManager` is set to `api.UnknownStatus` instead of `api.LedStatusUnknown`, aligning with the API.
* **11:28:44 AM:** The `setBlinkCodeAsActiveLed` function now correctly compares `blinkCode` with `manager.lastBlinkCode` instead of the global `lastBlinkCode`.
* **11:31:50 AM - 11:32:14 AM:** The `Run` function is significantly improved. The initial LED state is now loaded from persistent storage (`loadBlinkCode`). If no blink code is found, the heartbeat's initial health is used instead of `Booting`.
* **11:46:16 AM - 11:49:33 AM:** The `resolveActiveBlinkCode` function is updated to handle the case where `blinkCodes` has length > 0. The sleep time in the main loop is increased to 250 milliseconds.
* **11:53:18 AM - 11:56:44 AM:** The sleep time in the main loop is further increased to 1000 milliseconds. A log statement in `clearBlinkCode` is removed.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/api/api.go` Updates:**

The `api.go` file sees minor changes, mostly clarifying comments:

* **11:27:31 AM - 11:28:13 AM:** The comment for `ClearBlinkCode` in `LedStatus` is slightly modified to improve clarity.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Frequent updates to the `led.go` file suggest iterative development and debugging.
* Many functions have "TODO" comments, signifying ongoing development.
*  The code consistently uses the `log` package for logging various events, which is good practice for debugging and monitoring.
* A consistent pattern of checking for changes before updates in various functions(`setBlinkCodeAsActiveLed`, `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed`). This optimization prevents unnecessary actions.
* The sleep duration in the main loop of `led.go` is adjusted multiple times, potentially reflecting performance tuning or troubleshooting.


The overall evolution of the codebase shows a movement towards a more robust and refined LED management system.  The initial version was skeletal, but later commits fleshed out error handling, improved logic and added more precise checking to prevent unnecessary updates.


## 2:16:43 PM
The log shows a single significant code change at 1:59:09 PM on June 25, 2025, affecting the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/BUILD.bazel` file.  This file is a Bazel build file defining a Go library named "led." The update specifies that the library depends on other internal libraries located within the `go/bin/ChassisManager` and `go/src` directories, including an API, a queue, a logging module and a Unix HTTP module.  The library itself consists of three Go source files: `heartbeat.go`, `manager.go`, and `manager_factory.go`. The library's import path is defined as "github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led" and has public visibility.  There is an empty file named "Untitled-1" recorded at 1:59:40 PM with no content.


## 3:16:44 PM
The log shows development of a Go program for managing system LEDs.  The `manager.go` file underwent initial development (2:32 PM and 2:38 PM), focusing on LED state management using a queue, heartbeat monitoring, and handling blink codes.  Many functions are placeholders, indicated by "TODO" comments.

Between 2:54 PM and 3:08 PM, significant changes involved creating and refining interfaces (`chassis_interface.go` and `adapter_interface.go`).  The `ChassisAdapterInterface` was introduced to abstract LED operations for testing and different chassis types. A specific adapter for Leopard chassis, `leopard_adapter_v1.go`, was started, but remained largely incomplete at 3:08 PM. A crucial step towards implementing this adapter is the creation of `state_file.go` (3:11 PM), providing functions for persistent storage of blink codes. By 3:12 PM, a skeleton of the `LeopardAdapterV1` struct was created with placeholder functions that call `saveBlinkCodeToFile` and `loadBlinkCodeFromFile` from the `state_file.go` file.  Finally, the `api.go` file (3:13 PM) defines enums for LED senders and statuses, providing the foundation for data exchange within the system.  The `Untitled-1` and `Untitled-2` files appear to be empty or unused.  The overall pattern is iterative development, starting with a core LED manager and gradually adding interfaces and concrete implementations for hardware abstraction and persistent storage.


## 4:16:56 PM
The log shows development of a Chassis Manager's LED control system in Go.  Significant changes occurred between 3:17 PM and 4:16 PM on June 25, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/patterns.go`: This file defines LED patterns. Initially, only solid red, amber, and green were defined.  Subsequent updates added a solid teal pattern (booting state) and  comments indicating more status codes are planned. Finally, the `LedPattern` type was changed from `int` to a `struct` containing `useBlinkCode`, `blinkCode`, and `solidPattern` fields. A `String()` method was added for better representation.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopard_adapter_v1.go`: This file implements a specific LED adapter for "Leopard" chassis.  Early versions had incomplete method definitions.  Later updates fleshed out the methods (`setSystemLED`, `SaveBlinkCode`, `LoadBlinkCode`), corrected the `NewLeopardAdapterV1` function name to `newLeopardAdapterV1`,  and made the methods receiver functions rather than simple function declarations.  The `LedChassisInterface` was replaced by `ChassisAdapterInterface`.  Finally, the struct was simplified to an empty struct.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/adapter_interface.go`: This file defines the `ChassisAdapterInterface`, specifying methods for setting system LEDs, saving and loading blink codes.  A minor correction was made to the `saveBlinkCode` method signature.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go`: This file contains the core LED manager logic.  The `newManager` function's name changed from `newManager` to `NewManager` to follow naming conventions. The code undergoes many refinements, including correcting the type of `adapter` from `*ChassisAdapterInterface` to `ChassisAdapterInterface` and  integrating the `LeopardAdapterV1`. The `Run` function incorporates a heartbeat monitor and a main loop to manage LED updates based on blink codes and heartbeat status.  Several placeholder comments (`// todo`) indicate planned implementations for setting LED status based on health and handling the queue of update requests. The initial `lastBlinkCode` is set to `api.UnknownStatus` and then later changed to `api.ClearBlinkCode`.  Finally, the `clearBlinkCode` function was improved to only save `api.ClearBlinkCode` if the current `lastBlinkCode` is different.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_factory.go`: This file provides a factory function (`NewLedManager`) to create the LED manager. Initially it hardcoded the LeopardAdapterV1; this remains unchanged.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/BUILD.bazel`:  This file is a Bazel build file, listing the Go source files for the LED module.  Minor formatting adjustments were made in the `srcs` list.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/state_file.go`: This file contains helper functions (`saveBlinkCodeToFile`, `loadBlinkCodeFromFile`) to manage persistent LED state. Placeholder `log.Warnf` messages indicate these functions are yet to be fully implemented.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/app/app.go`: This file shows the integration of the LED manager into the main application. The LED manager is initialized and its `Run` method is started in a goroutine.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/api/api.go`: This file defines constants and types used across the Chassis Manager, including LED status codes (`LedStatus`) and sender IDs (`LedSender`).  A `String()` method is added for both types to make debugging easier.  `ClearBlinkCode`, `SolidRed`, `SolidAmber`, `SolidGreen`, and `SolidTeal` constants were added to `LedStatus`.


The overall development pattern shows a gradual refinement of the LED control system, starting with basic LED pattern definitions and progressing to a more robust system with an adapter interface, a state management mechanism using files, and integration with a heartbeat monitor and a queue for handling update requests. Many functions still have placeholder `TODO` comments.


## 5:16:46 PM
The codebase focuses on managing system LEDs, primarily through a `Manager` which interacts with an adapter (`LeopardAdapterV1` in this case) to set LED states based on heartbeat health and blink codes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go` file defines the core LED `Manager`.  Significant updates to this file occurred at 6/25/2025, 4:17:01 PM.  This file manages a work queue for LED updates and integrates a `HeartbeatMonitor` for health status.  The `Manager` uses the adapter to set system LEDs based on either blink codes or heartbeat health.  Many TODOs remain, particularly around blink code prioritization and queue management.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopard_adapter_v1.go` file (updated 6/25/2025, 4:17:16 PM) provides a concrete implementation of the `ChassisAdapterInterface`.  This adapter is currently a placeholder, with the `setSystemLED` function marked as a TODO.  File I/O is used to save and load blink codes.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go` file (with updates at 4:20:54 PM, 4:48:07 PM, 4:49:06 PM, and 4:49:56 PM) defines the `HeartbeatMonitor`, which periodically checks the health of the SSR using a UNIX socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock`.  The most significant change in this file was the introduction of a `makeRequest` function and a constructor that accepts a function for mocking purposes.  This allows for better testability.  It uses different retry attempts for initialization and reconnections, reflecting different tolerance levels for establishing and maintaining the heartbeat.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_factory.go` file (multiple updates between 4:42:29 PM and 4:55:01 PM) is responsible for creating `LedManager` instances.  Initially, it hardcoded the `LeopardAdapterV1`, but later versions simplify the logic.  TODOs remain regarding dynamic adapter selection based on system context.  Multiple updates to this file suggest iterative refinement of the factory's design.
