# Activity Summary for 6/26/2025

## 10:16:44 AM
The log shows three revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go` file, all within a short time frame on June 26th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: a heartbeat monitor that periodically checks the health of an SSR (presumably a Juniper Networks system) by making requests to a `/api/v1/chassis/heartbeat` endpoint via a Unix socket.

The most significant change occurs between the first and second revisions (9:50:33 AM and 9:52:31 AM).  The `HeartbeatMonitor` struct's `healthMu` field is changed from `sync.RWMutex` to `sync.Mutex`.  This suggests a simplification of the thread safety mechanisms used to manage the `health` field. The comment "// way to short-circuit the request function for testing" is also added to the struct, indicating a likely improvement for testability.

The third revision (9:53:11 AM) introduces a minor but important change in `fetchSsrHealth()`.  Instead of directly calling `monitor.makeHeartbeatRequest()`, it now uses the `monitor.makeRequest()` function. This improvement allows for easier mocking or substitution of the request function during testing, further enhancing testability which started in the previous revision.  The rest of the code remains functionally identical across all three revisions.  The changes are focused primarily on improving testability and potentially simplifying concurrency control.
