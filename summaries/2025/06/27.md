# Activity Summary for 6/27/2025

## 10:23:17 AM
The log shows a series of code changes across several files within a Chassis Manager application.  The primary focus is on the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led` directory, specifically the `heartbeat.go`, `manager.go`, and associated test files (`heartbeat_test.go`, `manager_externals_test.go`).

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go`: This file underwent two nearly identical revisions on 6/27/2025, 9:34:43 AM and 9:35:05 AM. The only difference was a minor correction in `NewTestHeartbeatMonitor` to ensure `makeRequest` is always set, preventing nil pointer dereferences.  The code implements a heartbeat monitor that periodically checks the health of an SSR (likely a switch or router) via a Unix domain socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock`. The monitor reports health as `InService`, `DegradedService`, or `OutOfService`, handling multiple consecutive failures before declaring `OutOfService`.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat_test.go`: This file saw extensive modifications between 9:38:30 AM and 10:09:47 AM.  Initially empty, it progressively developed comprehensive test cases for the heartbeat monitor, including various dummy responses (healthy, unhealthy, bad status codes, no response). The tests use `NewTestHeartbeatMonitor` to inject mock request functions for controlled testing.  The final revision left the test logic (`// todo`) unimplemented, but the test setup was fully configured.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_externals_test.go`: This file contains unit tests focusing on the `ManagerTestExternals` struct, a mock implementation for abstracting file and LED operations.  Several revisions (between 9:59:16 AM and 10:09:07 AM) refined the `HeartbeatTestMonitor` and the `ManagerTestExternals` mock implementation, improving clarity and replacing the real `HeartbeatMonitor` with a `DummyHeartbeatMonitor` that does not make HTTP requests.  Changes focused on making the tests more robust and isolated from external dependencies, including modifications to the sleep duration within the `Run` function.  The final revision at 10:09:07 AM introduced `DummyHeartbeatMonitor`, a no-op for testing.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go`:  This file was significantly updated on 6/27/2025, 10:14:04 AM, 10:14:33 AM, 10:17:04 AM, 10:17:19 AM, and 10:17:49 AM. This file contains the core LED manager logic. The major changes involved improving the `processRequestQueue` function to handle `api.UnknownSender` and `api.UnknownStatus` updates gracefully, and to remove senders with `api.ClearStatus` from the `senderBlinkCodes` map.  The code processes LED update requests from a queue, prioritizes blink codes over heartbeat status, and updates the system LED accordingly.   Improvements to error handling and logging were also included.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/app/app.go`: This file, updated at 10:19:51 AM, is the application entry point. It initializes and starts the temperature manager, LED manager, and HTTP server.  The code structure shows a clear separation of concerns.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go`: These files, updated at 10:20:57 AM and 10:21:36 AM respectively, define the HTTP server and its handlers. The server uses a Unix domain socket, sets up routes for LED and temperature management, and handles timeouts for requests. The handler is mostly stubbed out at this point, indicating ongoing development.


In summary, the code changes reflect the development and testing of a robust LED management system within the Chassis Manager.  The development process involved iterative refinement of the core logic, incorporating detailed testing, and a focus on modular design and clear separation of concerns.  The most significant changes involved handling different states of the LED and handling error conditions in a more robust fashion.


## 11:23:34 AM
The log shows extensive development on the `ChassisManager` application, focusing primarily on the `server` and `led` packages.  The most significant changes revolve around LED management and the server's API handling.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go`**: This file undergoes numerous revisions throughout the log.  Initially, many functions are stubs (`// TODO stub, needs to be implemented`).  Between 10:28:24 AM and 10:28:45 AM, a crucial change occurs in `GetSystemLed()`:  it's updated to return the actual `data` map instead of an empty one, providing the LED's status (blink code or solid pattern).  Later revisions (starting around 10:55:35 AM) add functionality to the `UpdateLedStatus()` method, enabling it to receive and process `led.UpdateRequest` objects, validating sender and status, and enqueuing requests to the LED manager's work queue.  Finally, the  `UpdateLedStatus` function is updated to correctly handle the case where the sender or status is invalid by setting them to the `UnknownSender` and `UnknownStatus` respectively, and still sending the request to the queue.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go`**:  This file focuses on LED management.  The main changes concern refining the `processRequestQueue` function (around 10:32:27 AM), improving its error handling and logging. The `update` struct fields `LedSender` and `LedStatus` are changed to `sender` and `status` respectively.  Another significant change, made at 10:50:28 AM, involves correcting a typo where `update.status` was used instead of `update.Status` in the `processRequestQueue` function.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_externals_test.go`**: This file contains unit tests for the LED manager, showing a focus on robust testing practices.  The code includes dummy implementations for interfaces like `HeartbeatInterface` and `ManagerExternalsInterface` facilitating isolated testing.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/patterns.go`**: A minor change in casing of the struct fields from `UseBlinkCode` and `BlinkCode` to `UseBlinkCode` and `BlinkCode` respectively.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopard_cpld.go`**: This file introduces code specific to interacting with a Leopard CPLD (likely a hardware component) for LED control.  The code defines various LED colors and modes and functions to write to CPLD files, suggesting specific hardware interaction.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go`**:  This file defines the server logic.  Significant changes occur in `updateLedStatus` function around 10:53:36 AM, where request body parsing using `json.Decode` is added and the `r.Body` is closed. The code also includes the addition of a handler for the  `/led/update` endpoint to handle LED status updates.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/BUILD.bazel`**: This file is a Bazel build file, showing dependencies for the server package.  The changes reflect the ongoing development and addition of new dependencies.

The overall pattern shows a progression from stubbed-out functionality to a more complete implementation of LED control and API endpoints.  There is also evidence of iterative development, with frequent small changes and refinements to error handling, logging, and data structures. The major development focus is on improving the functionality related to system LED control, receiving, validating and handling update requests and handling errors.
