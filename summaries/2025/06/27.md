# Activity Summary for 6/27/2025

## 10:23:17 AM
The log shows a series of code changes across several files within a Chassis Manager application.  The primary focus is on the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led` directory, specifically the `heartbeat.go`, `manager.go`, and associated test files (`heartbeat_test.go`, `manager_externals_test.go`).

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go`: This file underwent two nearly identical revisions on 6/27/2025, 9:34:43 AM and 9:35:05 AM. The only difference was a minor correction in `NewTestHeartbeatMonitor` to ensure `makeRequest` is always set, preventing nil pointer dereferences.  The code implements a heartbeat monitor that periodically checks the health of an SSR (likely a switch or router) via a Unix domain socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock`. The monitor reports health as `InService`, `DegradedService`, or `OutOfService`, handling multiple consecutive failures before declaring `OutOfService`.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat_test.go`: This file saw extensive modifications between 9:38:30 AM and 10:09:47 AM.  Initially empty, it progressively developed comprehensive test cases for the heartbeat monitor, including various dummy responses (healthy, unhealthy, bad status codes, no response). The tests use `NewTestHeartbeatMonitor` to inject mock request functions for controlled testing.  The final revision left the test logic (`// todo`) unimplemented, but the test setup was fully configured.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_externals_test.go`: This file contains unit tests focusing on the `ManagerTestExternals` struct, a mock implementation for abstracting file and LED operations.  Several revisions (between 9:59:16 AM and 10:09:07 AM) refined the `HeartbeatTestMonitor` and the `ManagerTestExternals` mock implementation, improving clarity and replacing the real `HeartbeatMonitor` with a `DummyHeartbeatMonitor` that does not make HTTP requests.  Changes focused on making the tests more robust and isolated from external dependencies, including modifications to the sleep duration within the `Run` function.  The final revision at 10:09:07 AM introduced `DummyHeartbeatMonitor`, a no-op for testing.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go`:  This file was significantly updated on 6/27/2025, 10:14:04 AM, 10:14:33 AM, 10:17:04 AM, 10:17:19 AM, and 10:17:49 AM. This file contains the core LED manager logic. The major changes involved improving the `processRequestQueue` function to handle `api.UnknownSender` and `api.UnknownStatus` updates gracefully, and to remove senders with `api.ClearStatus` from the `senderBlinkCodes` map.  The code processes LED update requests from a queue, prioritizes blink codes over heartbeat status, and updates the system LED accordingly.   Improvements to error handling and logging were also included.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/app/app.go`: This file, updated at 10:19:51 AM, is the application entry point. It initializes and starts the temperature manager, LED manager, and HTTP server.  The code structure shows a clear separation of concerns.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go`: These files, updated at 10:20:57 AM and 10:21:36 AM respectively, define the HTTP server and its handlers. The server uses a Unix domain socket, sets up routes for LED and temperature management, and handles timeouts for requests. The handler is mostly stubbed out at this point, indicating ongoing development.


In summary, the code changes reflect the development and testing of a robust LED management system within the Chassis Manager.  The development process involved iterative refinement of the core logic, incorporating detailed testing, and a focus on modular design and clear separation of concerns.  The most significant changes involved handling different states of the LED and handling error conditions in a more robust fashion.


## 11:23:34 AM
The log shows extensive development on the `ChassisManager` application, focusing primarily on the `server` and `led` packages.  The most significant changes revolve around LED management and the server's API handling.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go`**: This file undergoes numerous revisions throughout the log.  Initially, many functions are stubs (`// TODO stub, needs to be implemented`).  Between 10:28:24 AM and 10:28:45 AM, a crucial change occurs in `GetSystemLed()`:  it's updated to return the actual `data` map instead of an empty one, providing the LED's status (blink code or solid pattern).  Later revisions (starting around 10:55:35 AM) add functionality to the `UpdateLedStatus()` method, enabling it to receive and process `led.UpdateRequest` objects, validating sender and status, and enqueuing requests to the LED manager's work queue.  Finally, the  `UpdateLedStatus` function is updated to correctly handle the case where the sender or status is invalid by setting them to the `UnknownSender` and `UnknownStatus` respectively, and still sending the request to the queue.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go`**:  This file focuses on LED management.  The main changes concern refining the `processRequestQueue` function (around 10:32:27 AM), improving its error handling and logging. The `update` struct fields `LedSender` and `LedStatus` are changed to `sender` and `status` respectively.  Another significant change, made at 10:50:28 AM, involves correcting a typo where `update.status` was used instead of `update.Status` in the `processRequestQueue` function.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_externals_test.go`**: This file contains unit tests for the LED manager, showing a focus on robust testing practices.  The code includes dummy implementations for interfaces like `HeartbeatInterface` and `ManagerExternalsInterface` facilitating isolated testing.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/patterns.go`**: A minor change in casing of the struct fields from `UseBlinkCode` and `BlinkCode` to `UseBlinkCode` and `BlinkCode` respectively.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopard_cpld.go`**: This file introduces code specific to interacting with a Leopard CPLD (likely a hardware component) for LED control.  The code defines various LED colors and modes and functions to write to CPLD files, suggesting specific hardware interaction.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go`**:  This file defines the server logic.  Significant changes occur in `updateLedStatus` function around 10:53:36 AM, where request body parsing using `json.Decode` is added and the `r.Body` is closed. The code also includes the addition of a handler for the  `/led/update` endpoint to handle LED status updates.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/BUILD.bazel`**: This file is a Bazel build file, showing dependencies for the server package.  The changes reflect the ongoing development and addition of new dependencies.

The overall pattern shows a progression from stubbed-out functionality to a more complete implementation of LED control and API endpoints.  There is also evidence of iterative development, with frequent small changes and refinements to error handling, logging, and data structures. The major development focus is on improving the functionality related to system LED control, receiving, validating and handling update requests and handling errors.


## 12:23:48 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go` files between 11:23 AM and 12:14 PM on June 27, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the implementation of a Chassis Manager server, handling requests related to LEDs, temperatures, power, fans, firmware, and hardware information.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go` Updates:**

* **Initial Version (11:23 AM):** This version establishes the basic structure of the server, including timeouts for queries and updates, route setup for various API endpoints (/api/chassis/leds, /api/chassis/temperature, etc.), and a `Serve` function to start the server on a Unix domain socket.  Many handler functions are marked as `TODO` stubs.
* **Subsequent Revisions (11:27 AM - 11:54 AM):** Minor changes occurred during this period, primarily involving the `updateLedStatus` function's request body type (`LedStatus` to `updateLedBody`).  The `log.Infof` statement was added to the `updateLedStatus` function to log the parsed request, improving debugging capabilities. There was also a correction to the JSON tags in `updateLedBody` struct from `json:"sender"` and `json:"status"` to `json:"Sender"` and `json:"Status"` respectively.


* **Final Revision (12:14 PM):** The `updateLedBody` struct's fields `sender` and `status` were renamed to `Sender` and `Status` respectively, improving consistency with Go naming conventions.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go` Updates:**

* **Initial Version (11:28 AM):** This version defines the `Handler` struct and methods for processing various requests.  Many of these methods are stubs (`TODO`), indicating that the actual data processing logic was yet to be fully implemented. The `GetSystemLed` function retrieves the system LED state, handling both blink codes and solid patterns.  The `UpdateLedStatus` function enqueues LED update requests.  `GetTemperatures` provides temperature readings in millidegrees.
* **Subsequent Revisions (11:29 AM - 12:14 PM):**  The major change in this file is the refactoring of the `UpdateLedStatus` function's input parameter.  The type of `req`  changed from `led.updateLedBody` to `led.UpdateRequest` and validation was improved for `sender` and `status` parameters to ensure that they are within the defined ranges specified by `api.UnknownSender`, `api.MistAgent`, `api.UnknownStatus`, and `api.UnexpectedFailure`.  There was a also change to use more descriptive error messages for invalid inputs.


The overall pattern suggests an iterative development process.  The initial versions established the framework, and subsequent revisions focused on refining the `updateLedStatus` function,  improving error handling, and completing the implementation of data processing within the handler functions.  The use of `TODO` comments indicates ongoing development and planned features.


## 1:29:52 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go` file between 12:27 PM and 12:59 PM on June 27, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is the improvement of the LED management system within the ChassisManager.

The initial version (12:27:06 PM) introduced a `Manager` struct to hold LED management state, including a request queue, heartbeat monitor, and a map tracking blink codes from different senders. The `Run` function launches the heartbeat monitor and enters a main loop, periodically checking for LED updates and setting the LED accordingly.  There were several `TODO` comments indicating areas for future development, such as refining the logic for resolving conflicting blink codes and implementing dynamic sleep durations.


Subsequent changes (12:27:44 PM, 12:30:19 PM, 12:30:36 PM) involved minor refactoring and bug fixes in `processSystemLED` function for handling updates and clarifying the logic of using blink codes or heartbeat health to manage the LED states. The `resolveActiveBlinkCode` function remained largely unchanged. A parameter `hasUpdates` was added and later removed to `resolveActiveBlinkCode` function. 

A significant change occurred around 12:33 PM. The `resolveActiveBlinkCode` function was enhanced to handle situations where no new updates were received from the queue.  It now continues with the last blink code if it was not cleared or unknown.

Further refinements (12:39:59 PM, 12:40:12 PM, 12:40:27 PM, 12:41:32 PM, 12:42:05 PM, 12:42:34 PM) focused on simplifying the LED update workflow and improving code clarity. A `isDisplayable` or `isValidCode` helper function was added to check if a given blink code is valid for display.  The code in `processSystemLED` was streamlined and redundant parts commented out.

Finally, the most substantial change (12:53:44 PM, 12:57:11 PM, 12:58:06 PM, 12:58:42 PM, 12:59:13 PM) involved replacing the `lastHeartbeat` and `lastBlinkCode` members of the `Manager` struct with a single `lastPattern` member to encapsulate the last used LED pattern.  This simplifies the state management and ensures consistency.  The `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed` and `setBlinkCodeAsActiveLed` functions were updated to directly manage this `lastPattern`.  The `clearBlinkCode` function was also updated and simplified. The updates to the `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed` and `setBlinkCodeAsActiveLed` functions include explicit comments clarifying the purpose of each line in relation to physical LED, cache, and state recovery.  This version removes the redundant call to `saveBlinkCode` in `setHeartbeatAsActiveLed`.


## 2:25:46 PM
The code changes primarily involve the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager` project, focusing on LED management and server handling.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go` (6/27/2025, 1:58:24 PM):** This file defines a `Manager` struct and associated methods for managing LED updates.  The manager processes LED updates from a queue, prioritizing blink codes over heartbeat health indicators.  It interacts with both a `ServerIO` (presumably for internal server communication) and an `externals` interface (likely for interacting with the hardware).  The code uses goroutines for concurrent operations, especially for the heartbeat monitor. Error handling is included for queue operations and unknown senders or status updates. A significant portion of the code deals with setting and resolving LED patterns based on different statuses (blink codes and heartbeat health).  The logic for resolving multiple simultaneous blink codes is currently naive and marked for future improvement.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go` (6/27/2025, 1:58:34 PM):** This file defines a `Handler` struct responsible for processing server requests related to LED status, temperature readings, and other system information. Many functions are marked as "TODO stubs," indicating incomplete implementation.  The `UpdateLedStatus` function is fully implemented and handles sending LED updates to the work queue defined in the `led` package.  Temperature data is converted to millidegrees.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopard_cpld.go` (6/27/2025, 2:04:03 PM and 6/27/2025, 2:04:20 PM):** This file contains code specific to controlling LEDs on a "Leopard CPLD" (likely a type of hardware).  The only difference between the two timestamps for this file is a minor change in how `cpld_dir` is defined, removing a commented-out test directory. The code defines functions to set LED patterns based on blink codes and heartbeat health.  It uses a `leopardLedWriter` struct to manage LED parameters (brightness, colors, blink patterns) and writes these parameters to files in the `/sys/kernel/leopard_cpld/` directory, suggesting direct system-level interaction.  The code handles various LED statuses, including manufacturing states and network connectivity indicators, mapping them to specific color and blink patterns.  Error handling is included for file operations.  The code uses a functional options pattern for configuring the `leopardLedWriter`.

In summary, the changes represent a significant portion of the LED control logic, its integration with the rest of the Chassis Manager, and a specific implementation for a Leopard CPLD. The second update to `leopard_cpld.go` is a minor refactoring, removing a temporary test path.  A recurring theme is the use of error handling and logging throughout the codebase.  Many functions are incomplete, marked with "TODO,"  indicating ongoing development.


## 4:29:42 PM
The log shows a single update to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file at 3:53:46 PM on June 27, 2025.  This update consists of adding or updating SSH host keys for numerous IP addresses and hostnames.  The IP addresses are predominantly in the 10.27.x.x range. Multiple key types are present, including `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`.  Several entries pertain to the same IP address ([10.27.15.13]) but with different port numbers (12811, 12805, 12807, 12804, 12809, 12806).  One `ssh-rsa` key is duplicated across multiple IP addresses (10.27.34.127, 10.27.35.202 and possibly others, the log is truncated). This suggests potential reuse of the same key for different hosts, which may be a security concern.
