# Activity Summary for 6/30/2025

## 11:43:53 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/patterns.go` on June 30, 2025, at 11:35:01 AM.  This file defines a `LedPattern` struct and a `sleepDuration` function.  The `LedPattern` struct includes fields for blink codes (using `api.LedStatus` from the `api` package), solid patterns, and heartbeat health. The `sleepDuration` function calculates a time.Duration based on the provided `LedPattern`, differentiating between blink codes and solid patterns, assigning various durations (in milliseconds) to different states (e.g., 1000ms for blinking, 5000ms for InService, 3000ms for Faulted).  A return value of -1 indicates an invalid or undefined duration.  The code includes comments indicating that the duration logic is incomplete ("todo: information on the LED patterns").  The primary update is the implementation of the `sleepDuration` function to manage LED timings based on different status conditions.


## 12:43:57 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the LED control system for a Leopard chassis.  The primary file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopard_cpld.go`, underwent several updates between 11:49:57 AM and 11:56:46 AM on June 30th, 2025. These changes primarily focused on refining the `getLeopardSystemPatternDuration` function which determines LED blink durations based on different system statuses.  Initially, manufacturing-related statuses had a duration of `* time.Millisecond` (likely an error), this was corrected to `3 * time.Millisecond` and later to `3 * time.Second` demonstrating a debugging and refinement process.  The file also contains functions to set LED colors, brightness, blink patterns, and modes via interactions with CPLD files located at `/Users/cnesbitt/test/dummy_cpld/`. The code uses a `leopardLedWriter` struct and associated helper functions to manage these settings.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_externals_leopard_v1.go` file was also modified multiple times during the same period (11:53:35 AM to 11:56:13 AM).  The changes focused on updating the `patternDuration` method within the `ManagerExternalsLeopardV1` struct to correctly reference the updated `getLeopardSystemPatternDuration` function.  This indicates an effort to maintain consistency between the LED control logic and the overall LED manager. The file defines a  `ManagerExternalsLeopardV1` struct acting as an abstraction layer for LED operations, improving testability and allowing for different chassis implementations.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go` file, responsible for the main LED manager logic, was updated several times between 11:55:13 AM and 11:55:27 AM. The key change here was renaming the `blinkCodeDuration` function call to `patternDuration` within the `Run` function, aligning with the changes in `manager_externals_leopard_v1.go`. The LED manager handles both blink codes and heartbeat health to determine the appropriate LED state and uses a queue (`manager.serverIO.RequestQueue`) for managing LED update requests.

Finally, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_externals_interface.go` was updated at 11:55:50 AM to reflect the change of function name from `patternDuration` to `blinkCodeDuration`  in the interface. The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/patterns.go` file remained largely unchanged, with only minor timestamp updates reflecting the overall file activity during the period.


## 1:43:54 PM
The provided code logs show development of a LED manager for a chassis system.  The primary file, `manager.go`, underwent two revisions within a short time frame (12:58:40 PM and 12:58:58 PM on June 30th, 2025). The second revision added a `time.Sleep` call within the main loop of the `Run` function, likely to ensure sufficient time for blink codes to complete a full cycle.  This file manages LED updates based on heartbeat health and blink codes received via a queue.  It uses a state machine to track the current LED pattern and persists the last active blink code to a file for recovery. The `processRequestQueue` function handles incoming blink code updates, validating senders and statuses before updating the internal state.  There are several `TODO` comments indicating areas for future improvement, particularly in resolving multiple simultaneous blink codes and handling edge cases.

A separate file, `manager_externals_leopard_v1.go`, (timestamp: 1:20:36 PM on June 30th, 2025), provides a specific implementation for a "Leopard V1" chassis, abstracting away hardware-specific LED control and persistence mechanisms (likely file-based). This file implements the `ManagerExternalsInterface`, suggesting a design geared towards flexibility and potential support for other chassis types in the future.  The functions within this file handle setting the LED pattern, determining pattern durations, saving and loading the blink code from persistent storage.


## 8:44:11 PM
The log shows development of a Go program, `ChassisManager`, focusing on LED management.  The key changes are spread across several files, primarily concerning LED control and testing.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_externals_interface.go`: This file defines the `ManagerExternalsInterface`, an interface for abstracting LED operations, enabling varied implementations (e.g., for testing or different chassis types).  It was updated at 1:45:18 PM and again at 2:01:13 PM, the second update adding a `todo` comment suggesting the addition of functions for PHY (Physical Layer) LED control.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_externals_leopard_v1.go`: This file implements the `ManagerExternalsInterface` for Leopard V1 chassis.  It was created at 1:45:25 PM and subsequently updated at 2:06:40 PM, with no substantial code changes.
