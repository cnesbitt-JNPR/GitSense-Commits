# Activity Summary for 6/30/2025

## 11:43:53 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/patterns.go` on June 30, 2025, at 11:35:01 AM.  This file defines a `LedPattern` struct and a `sleepDuration` function.  The `LedPattern` struct includes fields for blink codes (using `api.LedStatus` from the `api` package), solid patterns, and heartbeat health. The `sleepDuration` function calculates a time.Duration based on the provided `LedPattern`, differentiating between blink codes and solid patterns, assigning various durations (in milliseconds) to different states (e.g., 1000ms for blinking, 5000ms for InService, 3000ms for Faulted).  A return value of -1 indicates an invalid or undefined duration.  The code includes comments indicating that the duration logic is incomplete ("todo: information on the LED patterns").  The primary update is the implementation of the `sleepDuration` function to manage LED timings based on different status conditions.


## 12:43:57 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the LED control system for a Leopard chassis.  The primary file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopard_cpld.go`, underwent several updates between 11:49:57 AM and 11:56:46 AM on June 30th, 2025. These changes primarily focused on refining the `getLeopardSystemPatternDuration` function which determines LED blink durations based on different system statuses.  Initially, manufacturing-related statuses had a duration of `* time.Millisecond` (likely an error), this was corrected to `3 * time.Millisecond` and later to `3 * time.Second` demonstrating a debugging and refinement process.  The file also contains functions to set LED colors, brightness, blink patterns, and modes via interactions with CPLD files located at `/Users/cnesbitt/test/dummy_cpld/`. The code uses a `leopardLedWriter` struct and associated helper functions to manage these settings.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_externals_leopard_v1.go` file was also modified multiple times during the same period (11:53:35 AM to 11:56:13 AM).  The changes focused on updating the `patternDuration` method within the `ManagerExternalsLeopardV1` struct to correctly reference the updated `getLeopardSystemPatternDuration` function.  This indicates an effort to maintain consistency between the LED control logic and the overall LED manager. The file defines a  `ManagerExternalsLeopardV1` struct acting as an abstraction layer for LED operations, improving testability and allowing for different chassis implementations.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go` file, responsible for the main LED manager logic, was updated several times between 11:55:13 AM and 11:55:27 AM. The key change here was renaming the `blinkCodeDuration` function call to `patternDuration` within the `Run` function, aligning with the changes in `manager_externals_leopard_v1.go`. The LED manager handles both blink codes and heartbeat health to determine the appropriate LED state and uses a queue (`manager.serverIO.RequestQueue`) for managing LED update requests.

Finally, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_externals_interface.go` was updated at 11:55:50 AM to reflect the change of function name from `patternDuration` to `blinkCodeDuration`  in the interface. The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/patterns.go` file remained largely unchanged, with only minor timestamp updates reflecting the overall file activity during the period.
