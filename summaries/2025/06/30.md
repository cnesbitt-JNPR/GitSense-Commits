# Activity Summary for 6/30/2025

## 11:43:53 AM
The log shows a single code change to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/patterns.go` on June 30, 2025, at 11:35:01 AM.  This file defines a `LedPattern` struct and a `sleepDuration` function.  The `LedPattern` struct includes fields for blink codes (using `api.LedStatus` from the `api` package), solid patterns, and heartbeat health. The `sleepDuration` function calculates a time.Duration based on the provided `LedPattern`, differentiating between blink codes and solid patterns, assigning various durations (in milliseconds) to different states (e.g., 1000ms for blinking, 5000ms for InService, 3000ms for Faulted).  A return value of -1 indicates an invalid or undefined duration.  The code includes comments indicating that the duration logic is incomplete ("todo: information on the LED patterns").  The primary update is the implementation of the `sleepDuration` function to manage LED timings based on different status conditions.
