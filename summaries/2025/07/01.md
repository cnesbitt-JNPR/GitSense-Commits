# Activity Summary for 7/1/2025

## 9:43:55 AM
The log shows development on a Go-based LED manager for a chassis.  The updates span approximately 40 minutes on July 1st, 2025.

`phy_led_handler.go`: This file remained largely unchanged throughout the log. It defines a `PhyLedHandler` struct responsible for updating physical LED statuses.  The `updatePhyLedStatus` function is outlined but not implemented, indicating a future task involving interaction with C libraries and external interfaces.

`manager_externals_interface.go`: This file defines the `ManagerExternalsInterface`, an interface abstracting away the specifics of LED operations for different chassis types and unit testing.  Minor formatting changes were made to the `setPhyLED` function signature in subsequent commits (removal of `int` keyword before `port`).

`server_io.go`:  This file defines the `ServerIO` struct, handling communication between the LED manager server and handler. The main change was correcting the type of the `phyStates` map from `map[string]PhyStatus` to `map[int]PhyStatus` in the last two commits, indicating a bug fix.

`manager_externals_mock.go`: This file contains mock implementations for unit testing. A `getPhyStates` function was added in a later commit to the `MockManagerExternals` struct, providing a way to retrieve the simulated physical LED states.

`manager_externals_leopard_v1.go`: This file implements `ManagerExternalsInterface` for a specific chassis type ("Leopard V1").  The file includes placeholder comments ( "// todo:" ) and function calls (`setLeopardSystemLED`, `setLeopardPhyLED`, `getLeopardSystemPatternDuration`, `saveBlinkCodeToFile`, `loadBlinkCodeFromFile`) suggesting that implementation details are to be added later.  No functional changes were made between the two commits.

In summary, the changes reflect the initial structuring and mocking of code for an LED manager, with a focus on system and physical LED control.  The implementation of the physical LED handling and the Leopard V1-specific functions are left for future development.  The timestamp shows a concentrated effort between 9:24 AM and 9:36 AM. A bug in `server_io.go` concerning the `phyStates` map was also fixed.
