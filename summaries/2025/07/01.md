# Activity Summary for 7/1/2025

## 9:43:55 AM
The log shows development on a Go-based LED manager for a chassis.  The updates span approximately 40 minutes on July 1st, 2025.

`phy_led_handler.go`: This file remained largely unchanged throughout the log. It defines a `PhyLedHandler` struct responsible for updating physical LED statuses.  The `updatePhyLedStatus` function is outlined but not implemented, indicating a future task involving interaction with C libraries and external interfaces.

`manager_externals_interface.go`: This file defines the `ManagerExternalsInterface`, an interface abstracting away the specifics of LED operations for different chassis types and unit testing.  Minor formatting changes were made to the `setPhyLED` function signature in subsequent commits (removal of `int` keyword before `port`).

`server_io.go`:  This file defines the `ServerIO` struct, handling communication between the LED manager server and handler. The main change was correcting the type of the `phyStates` map from `map[string]PhyStatus` to `map[int]PhyStatus` in the last two commits, indicating a bug fix.

`manager_externals_mock.go`: This file contains mock implementations for unit testing. A `getPhyStates` function was added in a later commit to the `MockManagerExternals` struct, providing a way to retrieve the simulated physical LED states.

`manager_externals_leopard_v1.go`: This file implements `ManagerExternalsInterface` for a specific chassis type ("Leopard V1").  The file includes placeholder comments ( "// todo:" ) and function calls (`setLeopardSystemLED`, `setLeopardPhyLED`, `getLeopardSystemPatternDuration`, `saveBlinkCodeToFile`, `loadBlinkCodeFromFile`) suggesting that implementation details are to be added later.  No functional changes were made between the two commits.

In summary, the changes reflect the initial structuring and mocking of code for an LED manager, with a focus on system and physical LED control.  The implementation of the physical LED handling and the Leopard V1-specific functions are left for future development.  The timestamp shows a concentrated effort between 9:24 AM and 9:36 AM. A bug in `server_io.go` concerning the `phyStates` map was also fixed.


## 1:43:56 PM
The code changes primarily involve the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/` directory, focusing on LED control within a system named "Leopard".  The updates span from 1:14 PM to 1:36 PM on July 1st, 2025.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/phy_led_handler.go`: This file, updated at 1:14 PM, defines a `PhyLedHandler` struct and methods for managing physical LED status.  The `updatePhyLedStatus` function is a placeholder, indicating future implementation for interacting with a C library and setting LED states.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopard_cpld.go`: This file underwent multiple revisions between 1:33 PM and 1:35 PM.  The core functionality involves controlling LEDs through `/sys/kernel/leopard_cpld/` files.  Significant changes include:

* **1:33 PM:** Initial version defines constants for various CPLD control files (brightness, color, blink rates, modes etc.),  a slice `cpld_phy_leds` for individual port LED control, and functions `setLeopardSystemLED`, `setLeopardSystemLEDFromBlinkCode`, `setLeopardSystemLEDFromHealth`, `getLeopardSystemPatternDuration`, `setLeopardPhyLedStatus`, and `writeCPLDFile`.  The `writeCPLDFile` function was incomplete.  Comments indicate potential issues with the CPLD files themselves needing further investigation.

* **1:33 PM - 1:35 PM:** Subsequent commits added "cpss port"  information to the comments within `cpld_phy_leds`, refining the port descriptions.  The `writeCPLDFile` function was completed in the final commit (1:35 PM), adding file opening, permission setting, and error handling.  A note was added to `cpld_phy_leds` that cpss port 8 is reserved for ap12 and unused on non-ap Leopards.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_externals_interface.go`: Updated at 1:36 PM, this file defines the `ManagerExternalsInterface`, an interface abstracting LED operations for different chassis types and facilitating unit testing.  The interface includes methods for setting system and PHY LEDs, managing blink code, and creating a heartbeat monitor.


Recurring elements across the files include extensive use of comments (including TODOs), error handling within functions writing to files, and a consistent structure for managing LED states through color codes, blink patterns and modes.  The overall pattern suggests a system for managing LED status based on various system health indicators (manufacturing process, network connectivity) and physical port status.


## 3:43:54 PM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/phy_led_handler.go`.  The file is a Go program related to LED management, specifically handling physical (PHY) LED status updates.

The initial changes (2:52 PM and 2:53 PM) focus on adding  `#include` directives within the CGO comments.  The first addition includes `jnpr_cpss_api_phy.h`, while the second adds `jnpr_cpss_ipc_common_util.h`. This suggests an evolution in the external libraries used to interact with physical hardware.

A significant change occurs at 3:04 PM.  The `pkg-config` directive in the CGO comment is modified, changing from  `libJnprIpcClient.a libjnpr.a` to `libJnprIpcClient libjnpr`, and the import section now includes `import "C"`. This strongly indicates the program's interaction with C libraries has become more clearly defined and explicitly uses the C language within the Go code.

The final change at 3:28 PM modifies the `PhyStatus` struct.  The `speedMbps` field's position changes, and a new `valid` boolean field is added. This suggests a refinement in how PHY status data is handled, adding error checking (the `valid` flag likely indicates whether data is trustworthy).  The `updatePhyLedStatus` function remains unchanged throughout all the revisions, still containing "todo" comments.  The core functionality of this function is yet to be implemented.


## 5:29:39 PM
The log shows several code changes within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led` directory between 4:36 PM and 4:49 PM on July 1st, 2025.  The primary focus is on `phy_led_handler.go`, which underwent multiple revisions.  These revisions primarily involved minor cleanup and formatting of the include statements within the file.  Specifically, the changes transitioned from using `#cgo pkg-config:` to explicitly listing the header files with  `#include "jnpr_cpss_api_phy.h"` etc., removing a redundant `import "C"` statement in one revision.  The code itself, including the `updatePhyLedStatus` function (which remains marked as `// todo: to be implemented`), did not change functionally.

The `BUILD.bazel` file was also updated twice during this period, but the changes were insignificant â€“ just minor formatting or refreshing of the timestamp without affecting the contents of the file.  The `BUILD.bazel` file lists the Go files that comprise the `led` library, indicating it uses cgo for C interoperability, and lists its dependencies on other parts of the ChassisManager project.  Importantly, linking of the C libraries (`libJnprIpcClient`, `libjnpr`) is still marked as `# todo`, suggesting this is a work in progress.
