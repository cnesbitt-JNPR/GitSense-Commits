# Activity Summary for 7/8/2025

## 12:13:08 PM
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led` directory, primarily focusing on LED control within a Juniper Networks system, likely for a "Leopard" chassis.

The `phy_led_handler.go` file underwent several revisions between 11:32 AM and 11:42 AM.  These changes involved refining the `#cgo` directives, specifically the include paths for the C libraries used to interact with the physical LEDs. The initial path `/usr/qemu-aarch64/usr/include/juniper` was simplified to `/usr/qemu-aarch64/usr/include` and finally to `/usr/include` suggesting a shift from an ARM emulator environment to a native ARM build or a cross-compilation setup. The core functionality of `updatePhyLedStatus` remained largely untouched, indicating a focus on build environment adjustments rather than code logic changes during this period.  Later,  `phy_led_handler.go` remained unchanged.

The `BUILD.bazel` file was modified multiple times between 11:41 AM and 11:47 AM. These changes centered around the `copts` setting, which specifies compiler options for the Go build process. The modifications were related to include paths (`-I/usr/include`, `-I/usr/qemu-aarch64/usr/include`),  again suggesting adjustments for different build environments (native ARM vs. ARM emulation).  The commented-out sections related to linking C libraries (`libJnprIpcClient`, `libjnpr`) suggest ongoing work to integrate these libraries fully into the build process.  By 11:47 AM, the `copts` options were consolidated to include only the native ARM include directory `/usr/include`.

The `leopard_cpld.go` file was modified between 11:49 AM and 11:52 AM. The key change involved converting the `cpld_phy_leds` variable from a constant to a variable, allowing for potential runtime modifications to the LED mappings.  The majority of the file focuses on the logic to control system LEDs (system health and manufacturing status) and PHY LEDs, using  `writeCPLDFile` to interact with the system.

The `manager_externals_leopard_v1.go` file saw minor changes between 11:53 AM and 11:56 AM. A typo was corrected in a function call, changing `setLeopardPhyLED` to `setLeopardPhyLedStatus`, ensuring correct interaction with the `leopard_cpld.go` file.  This file acts as an abstraction layer, allowing for different implementations for various chassis types or testing.

In summary, the majority of the changes were related to build system configuration and include paths to adapt to different build environments (likely native ARM and ARM emulation). The code itself primarily deals with LED control on a Juniper Networks Leopard chassis, with clear separation between system and PHY LED management.  The commented-out code in `BUILD.bazel` indicates ongoing development and integration work.
