# Activity Summary for 7/8/2025

## 12:13:08 PM
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led` directory, primarily focusing on LED control within a Juniper Networks system, likely for a "Leopard" chassis.

The `phy_led_handler.go` file underwent several revisions between 11:32 AM and 11:42 AM.  These changes involved refining the `#cgo` directives, specifically the include paths for the C libraries used to interact with the physical LEDs. The initial path `/usr/qemu-aarch64/usr/include/juniper` was simplified to `/usr/qemu-aarch64/usr/include` and finally to `/usr/include` suggesting a shift from an ARM emulator environment to a native ARM build or a cross-compilation setup. The core functionality of `updatePhyLedStatus` remained largely untouched, indicating a focus on build environment adjustments rather than code logic changes during this period.  Later,  `phy_led_handler.go` remained unchanged.

The `BUILD.bazel` file was modified multiple times between 11:41 AM and 11:47 AM. These changes centered around the `copts` setting, which specifies compiler options for the Go build process. The modifications were related to include paths (`-I/usr/include`, `-I/usr/qemu-aarch64/usr/include`),  again suggesting adjustments for different build environments (native ARM vs. ARM emulation).  The commented-out sections related to linking C libraries (`libJnprIpcClient`, `libjnpr`) suggest ongoing work to integrate these libraries fully into the build process.  By 11:47 AM, the `copts` options were consolidated to include only the native ARM include directory `/usr/include`.

The `leopard_cpld.go` file was modified between 11:49 AM and 11:52 AM. The key change involved converting the `cpld_phy_leds` variable from a constant to a variable, allowing for potential runtime modifications to the LED mappings.  The majority of the file focuses on the logic to control system LEDs (system health and manufacturing status) and PHY LEDs, using  `writeCPLDFile` to interact with the system.

The `manager_externals_leopard_v1.go` file saw minor changes between 11:53 AM and 11:56 AM. A typo was corrected in a function call, changing `setLeopardPhyLED` to `setLeopardPhyLedStatus`, ensuring correct interaction with the `leopard_cpld.go` file.  This file acts as an abstraction layer, allowing for different implementations for various chassis types or testing.

In summary, the majority of the changes were related to build system configuration and include paths to adapt to different build environments (likely native ARM and ARM emulation). The code itself primarily deals with LED control on a Juniper Networks Leopard chassis, with clear separation between system and PHY LED management.  The commented-out code in `BUILD.bazel` indicates ongoing development and integration work.


## 1:12:52 PM
The log shows several code changes related to a Go project's `led` module within a larger `ChassisManager`.  The most significant changes occur in `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/BUILD.bazel` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/phy_led_handler.go`.

The `BUILD.bazel` file was modified multiple times between 12:39 PM and 12:59 PM. These modifications focused on the `copts` and `clinkopts` within the `go_library` rule.  Initially, an incorrect or extra include path ("`/usr/qemu-aarch64/usr/asdadss`") was removed from `copts`. Later changes added `clinkopts` to specify linker options, initially with a placeholder `"-l"`, subsequently corrected to explicitly link against  `jnpr` and `JnprIpcClient` libraries, using the correct paths for both native ARM and ARM emulator environments. The comments in `copts` and `clinkopts` were also refined, replacing "include" with "path".


The `phy_led_handler.go` file was modified several times between 12:43 PM and 12:45 PM. These changes primarily involved adding logging to the `updatePhyLedStatus` function using `log.Debugf` to track the return value and speed obtained from `C.getPhyPortLinkSpeed`.  Additionally, the `C.int` type was explicitly used for the port ID and speed parameters within the `C.getPhyPortLinkSpeed` function call. Finally, the import statement for the `log` package was added, making the code compilable.  These changes suggest debugging and refinement of the interaction with the C library (`jnpr_cpss_api_phy.h`).


## 2:12:50 PM
The log shows two updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/BUILD.bazel`, both within a minute of each other (1:56:24 PM and 1:56:33 PM on July 8th, 2025).  Both updates modify a `go_library` definition for the `led` module. The changes are minor: the second revision updates the comment for the `copts` setting from "ARM emulator path" to "ARM emulator dependencies".  The file content otherwise remains identical, including the list of source files (`srcs`), compiler and linker options (`copts`, `clinkopts`),  dependencies (`deps`), import path, and visibility.  The source files included are related to LED management, suggesting this module handles LED control within a Chassis Manager application.  The use of `cgo`, `copts`, and `clinkopts` indicates interaction with C code and libraries, possibly for low-level hardware access. The paths in `copts` and `clinkopts` suggest support for both native ARM and ARM emulation environments.


## 3:12:54 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/phy_led_handler.go` file between 2:23 PM and 3:12 PM on July 8, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is the implementation of the `updatePhyLedStatus` function within the `phy_led_handler.go` file.  This function aims to retrieve and update LED status for up to 10 ports on a chassis.

Initially, the function was a placeholder.  Subsequent revisions progressively added functionality:

* **Error Handling and Port Validation:**  The code was enhanced to incorporate error handling for invalid port IDs using `C.isValidMacPortId` and logging errors using `log.Errorf`.  The function now explicitly checks if a port ID is valid before proceeding.

* **Link Status Retrieval:**  The code gained the ability to determine the link status of each port, differentiating between PHY and MAC ports using `C.getPhyPortLinkStatus` and `C.getMacPortLinkStatus`.

* **Conditional Logic Based on Port Type:** The logic was refined to correctly handle both PHY and MAC ports, choosing the appropriate C function based on `isRj45Port`.

* **Link Speed Retrieval:** The function was further expanded to retrieve link speed using `C.getPhyPortLinkSpeed`.  Initially, there was an issue where the wrong function was used, which was subsequently corrected.

* **Speed Conversion Function:**  A `cpssSpeedToSpeedMbps` helper function was added to convert link speed values from a Juniper-specific representation to Mbps.  The function handles various speed values and defaults to 0 for unsupported speeds.

* **Total Ports Adjustment:**  The `total_ports` variable was changed from 9 to 10, indicating a change in the number of ports being managed.  The loop condition was also corrected to use `<` instead of `<=` for the proper iteration.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/BUILD.bazel` file was updated at 2:23:09 PM, defining a `go_library` named "led," specifying its source files, CGO settings, and dependencies. This BUILD file remained unchanged throughout the rest of the log.  The  `phy_led_handler.go` file revisions show a clear pattern of iterative development with a focus on improving error handling, robustness, and functionality in the port status and LED updates.  The final version handles port validation, link status, and speed retrieval in a significantly more refined manner than its initial form.
