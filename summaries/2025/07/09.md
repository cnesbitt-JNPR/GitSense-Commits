# Activity Summary for 7/9/2025

## 11:11:24 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to a `BUILD.bazel` file and a single Go file, `phy_led_handler.go`.

The `BUILD.bazel` file underwent several revisions between 11:00 AM and 11:06 AM on July 9, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the `copts` section, specifically toggling the inclusion/exclusion of  `"-I/usr/include"` and `"-v"`. The final revision removed `"-L/usr/lib64"` from `clinkopts`.  The `srcs` list and other attributes remained consistent throughout all revisions.

The `phy_led_handler.go` file was modified once at 11:06:49 AM on July 9, 2025. This revision corrected a bug in the `fetchPhyStatus` function.  The variable `phyStatus.speedMbps` was incorrectly assigned, using the `speed` variable instead of `linkSpeed`. The correction now correctly assigns the `linkSpeed` variable to `phyStatus.speedMbps`. The file utilizes C interoperability to interact with a Juniper Networks-specific library (`jnpr_cpss_api_*`), suggesting interaction with hardware components for LED control. The code is annotated with several `todo` comments.


## 12:11:25 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/BUILD.bazel` file between 11:12 AM and 11:55 AM on July 9, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is configuring the build process for different architectures, specifically targeting ARM (aarch64) and x86_64.

Initially, the `copts` and `clinkopts` were directly set, including paths for both native ARM and an ARM emulator.  Between 11:14 AM and 11:17 AM, there were several attempts to refactor this using `select` statements within the `BUILD` file to conditionally include compiler and linker options based on build configurations (initially using  `//conditions:default` and `//build_config:arm` or `//config:arm` and later `:arm`).  These attempts were unstable and reverted.

From 11:36 AM onwards, a more robust approach was implemented using `config_setting` and later `constraint_setting` and `constraint_value` to define configurations for ARM and x86_64 architectures.  The `config_setting` named "is_arm" (later renamed to "emulated_arm") is used to conditionally select the include paths for either the emulator (`-I/usr/qemu-aarch64/usr/include`) or the native system (`-I/usr/include`) based on the detected architecture.  A new `config_setting` "is_x86" was introduced to aid in this architecture selection. The final version at 11:55 AM uses `constraint_setting`  named "cpu" along with "is_x86"  `constraint_value` to determine the target architecture more precisely.

Throughout all revisions, the source files (`srcs`) and dependencies (`deps`) remained unchanged, indicating that the changes were solely concentrated on the build configuration aspects of the project. The `cgo` flag remains `True` consistently, showing that cgo is used throughout the build.  The order of `-ljnpr` and `-lJnprIpcClient` in `clinkopts` was also adjusted, though the significance of this is not apparent from the log alone.
