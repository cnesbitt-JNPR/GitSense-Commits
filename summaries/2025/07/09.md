# Activity Summary for 7/9/2025

## 11:11:24 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to a `BUILD.bazel` file and a single Go file, `phy_led_handler.go`.

The `BUILD.bazel` file underwent several revisions between 11:00 AM and 11:06 AM on July 9, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the `copts` section, specifically toggling the inclusion/exclusion of  `"-I/usr/include"` and `"-v"`. The final revision removed `"-L/usr/lib64"` from `clinkopts`.  The `srcs` list and other attributes remained consistent throughout all revisions.

The `phy_led_handler.go` file was modified once at 11:06:49 AM on July 9, 2025. This revision corrected a bug in the `fetchPhyStatus` function.  The variable `phyStatus.speedMbps` was incorrectly assigned, using the `speed` variable instead of `linkSpeed`. The correction now correctly assigns the `linkSpeed` variable to `phyStatus.speedMbps`. The file utilizes C interoperability to interact with a Juniper Networks-specific library (`jnpr_cpss_api_*`), suggesting interaction with hardware components for LED control. The code is annotated with several `todo` comments.


## 12:11:25 PM
The log shows numerous revisions to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/BUILD.bazel` file between 11:12 AM and 11:55 AM on July 9, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is configuring the build process for different architectures, specifically targeting ARM (aarch64) and x86_64.

Initially, the `copts` and `clinkopts` were directly set, including paths for both native ARM and an ARM emulator.  Between 11:14 AM and 11:17 AM, there were several attempts to refactor this using `select` statements within the `BUILD` file to conditionally include compiler and linker options based on build configurations (initially using  `//conditions:default` and `//build_config:arm` or `//config:arm` and later `:arm`).  These attempts were unstable and reverted.

From 11:36 AM onwards, a more robust approach was implemented using `config_setting` and later `constraint_setting` and `constraint_value` to define configurations for ARM and x86_64 architectures.  The `config_setting` named "is_arm" (later renamed to "emulated_arm") is used to conditionally select the include paths for either the emulator (`-I/usr/qemu-aarch64/usr/include`) or the native system (`-I/usr/include`) based on the detected architecture.  A new `config_setting` "is_x86" was introduced to aid in this architecture selection. The final version at 11:55 AM uses `constraint_setting`  named "cpu" along with "is_x86"  `constraint_value` to determine the target architecture more precisely.

Throughout all revisions, the source files (`srcs`) and dependencies (`deps`) remained unchanged, indicating that the changes were solely concentrated on the build configuration aspects of the project. The `cgo` flag remains `True` consistently, showing that cgo is used throughout the build.  The order of `-ljnpr` and `-lJnprIpcClient` in `clinkopts` was also adjusted, though the significance of this is not apparent from the log alone.


## 4:50:35 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to several files within a Chassis Manager application.  The primary focus appears to be on LED and sensor management.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/phy_led_handler.go`: This file defines a `PhyLedHandler` responsible for updating physical port LED statuses.  The initial version (7/9/2025, 2:52:04 PM) contains a placeholder implementation for `updatePhyLedStatus()`, indicating work in progress. Subsequent revisions (4:20:03 PM, 4:20:15 PM, 4:43:34 PM, 4:45:08 PM, 4:46:05 PM, 4:46:31 PM, 4:48:45 PM) refine the `fetchPhyStatus()` function, improving error handling and clarifying the logic for determining port validity and link status. The final version adds `//nolint` to suppress warnings and uses more descriptive field names (e.g., `Valid` instead of `valid`).  A consistent pattern is the use of C libraries (`jnpr_cpss_api_mac.h`, `jnpr_cpss_api_phy.h`, etc.) to interact with hardware.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/middleware/sensor_param.go`: This file manages middleware for handling sensor and port parameters in HTTP requests.  The initial version (7/9/2025, 2:56:32 PM) includes middleware for both sensor (`RequiredSensorContext`) and port (`RequiredPortNumberContext`) parameters, storing them in the request context.  Subsequent revisions (3:38:19 PM, 3:38:52 PM, 3:39:55 PM, 3:40:10 PM, 3:40:48 PM, 3:40:54 PM, 3:43:00 PM, 3:43:14 PM, 3:44:37 PM, 4:16:51 PM) focus on improving error handling and clarifying the parameter validation logic, introducing separate context keys for sensor and port. The `RequiredPortNumberContext` middleware is significantly changed to handle port numbers as strings and improve error messaging. The final change corrects `ContextValueType` return type for `PortKey` and improves error handling.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go`:  This file handles the main server logic.  Changes between 7/9/2025, 2:57:12 PM and 2:57:27 PM are minor and involve changing the middleware used for getting the port, from `PortParam` to `RequiredPortNumberContext`. There are no further changes to this file.  The server uses Chi router for setting up routes, handling requests related to LEDs, temperatures, power, fans, firmware, and hardware information.  Many functions are marked as `// TODO stub`, indicating future implementation. Timeouts for query and update operations are defined.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go`: This file contains the request handlers.  Multiple revisions (3:06:09 PM, 3:07:09 PM, 3:07:48 PM, 3:08:02 PM, 3:08:20 PM, 3:08:41 PM, 3:09:08 PM, 3:11:48 PM, 3:12:03 PM, 3:12:14 PM, 3:18:10 PM, 4:18:18 PM, 4:18:39 PM, 4:18:51 PM) improve the `GetPortLed` handler, initially by adding a basic implementation and gradually refining error handling and data formatting. The final revision includes a speed-based LED status assignment.  Many other handler functions are still stubs.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopard_cpld.go`: This file manages LED interactions specific to the "Leopard" chassis.  The single revision (7/9/2025, 3:19:08 PM and 4:25:15 PM) implements functions for setting system and physical port LEDs, using a CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device) interface (`/sys/kernel/leopard_cpld/`).  The code uses a `leopardLedWriter` struct to manage LED properties and a series of helper functions for setting LED parameters.  The `setLeopardPhyLedStatus` function is updated to require that the port is valid, and connected.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/server_io.go`: This file defines the `ServerIO` struct which acts as an interface between the server and the LED manager. Revisions (3:27:58 PM, 3:28:48 PM, 3:29:44 PM, 3:30:05 PM) rename mutex and correct return type for `GetPhyStatus`.  A `RequestQueue` for LED updates uses a queue with a default capacity.

In summary, the code changes reflect a gradual development process, starting with placeholders and progressing to more robust and complete implementations.  The focus is on enhancing the functionality for managing LEDs and sensors, particularly for the Leopard chassis.  There is a significant amount of error handling integrated throughout the code base.


## 5:50:00 PM
The log shows extensive modification of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/phy_led_handler.go` between 7/9/2025, 4:51:12 PM and 7/9/2025, 5:42:06 PM.  The file is a Go program that handles physical LED status updates.  Initially, it contained `todo` comments indicating incomplete implementation.  Subsequent changes focused on adding error handling and logging using the `log` package from `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`.  The code interacts heavily with C libraries (`jnpr_cpss_api_mac.h`, `jnpr_cpss_api_phy.h`, `jnpr_cpss_ipc_common_util.h`, `jnpr_cpss_ipc_common_types.h`) to retrieve physical port status (link status, speed, duplex).

A key change involved adding `//nolint` or `//nolint: ...` comments to suppress linter warnings, primarily related to `typecheck` and line length (`lll`), due to the cgo interactions. This was initially inconsistent in the comments but finally settled with  `//nolint: golint` and `//nolint: typecheck`.  The  `.golangci.yml` file at  `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/.golangci.yml` reflects this exclusion.

The `BUILD.bazel` file, updated at 7/9/2025, 5:33:16 PM, shows that `phy_led_handler.go` is part of the `led` library which uses cgo and links against Juniper-specific libraries (`-lJnprIpcClient`, `-ljnpr`).  The build configuration also includes compiler options to handle both ARM and ARM emulator environments, indicating cross-compilation support.  The final version of `phy_led_handler.go` at 5:42:06 PM appears to be the stable version after resolving linter issues.  An `Untitled-1` file was also present in the log, however it is empty and does not require any summarization.


## 6:49:56 PM
The log shows two updates to the `.golangci.yml` file at 5:54:06 PM and 5:54:43 PM on July 9, 2025.  Both updates have identical content, suggesting a possible accidental duplicate entry or an unsuccessful first attempt to save the file.  The file configures the `golangci-lint` tool, detailing various linters enabled and disabled, their settings (e.g., maximum function length, allowed rules), and exclusion rules.  A notable pattern is the extensive configuration tailored for the `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr` project, including specific exclusions for certain linters (like `typecheck` for `phy_led_handler.go` due to cgo usage) and customized rules for the project's logger.  The earlier log entry at 5:52:23 PM shows a `phy_led_handler.go` file update, which is a Go file related to LED management, involving C library calls for obtaining physical layer status.  This file's implementation includes functions to fetch and update LED status, handling different port types (RJ45 vs. others), and converting data between C types and Go types.  Many TODO comments are present, indicating ongoing development.
