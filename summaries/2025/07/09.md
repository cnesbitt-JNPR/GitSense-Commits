# Activity Summary for 7/9/2025

## 11:11:24 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to a `BUILD.bazel` file and a single Go file, `phy_led_handler.go`.

The `BUILD.bazel` file underwent several revisions between 11:00 AM and 11:06 AM on July 9, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the `copts` section, specifically toggling the inclusion/exclusion of  `"-I/usr/include"` and `"-v"`. The final revision removed `"-L/usr/lib64"` from `clinkopts`.  The `srcs` list and other attributes remained consistent throughout all revisions.

The `phy_led_handler.go` file was modified once at 11:06:49 AM on July 9, 2025. This revision corrected a bug in the `fetchPhyStatus` function.  The variable `phyStatus.speedMbps` was incorrectly assigned, using the `speed` variable instead of `linkSpeed`. The correction now correctly assigns the `linkSpeed` variable to `phyStatus.speedMbps`. The file utilizes C interoperability to interact with a Juniper Networks-specific library (`jnpr_cpss_api_*`), suggesting interaction with hardware components for LED control. The code is annotated with several `todo` comments.
