# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 11:42:30 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/phy_led_handler.go` between 10:53 AM and 10:56 AM on July 10, 2025.  The file is a Go program that handles physical (PHY) LED status updates.

The primary changes center around the initialization of `lastPhyStates` in the `newPhyHandler` function.  Initially, this map was initialized implicitly (only by creating it). Later revisions explicitly initialize `lastPhyStates` to a default state for all 10 ports within the `newPhyHandler` function, improving code clarity and ensuring all ports have a default status.  This is the most significant change in the log.

Another minor edit removes a `// todo:` comment from the `updatePhyLedStatus` function, indicating a step toward completing the function's implementation.  The code consistently interacts with C libraries (indicated by `C.` prefix) for obtaining PHY port status information and updates the LED states through an `externals` interface.  The code also handles different port types (RJ45 or MAC) and maps C library return values to Go data structures.  The constant `totalPorts` is hardcoded to 10, although the comment suggests this should ideally be chassis-specific.
