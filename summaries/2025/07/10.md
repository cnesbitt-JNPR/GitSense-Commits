# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 11:42:30 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/phy_led_handler.go` between 10:53 AM and 10:56 AM on July 10, 2025.  The file is a Go program that handles physical (PHY) LED status updates.

The primary changes center around the initialization of `lastPhyStates` in the `newPhyHandler` function.  Initially, this map was initialized implicitly (only by creating it). Later revisions explicitly initialize `lastPhyStates` to a default state for all 10 ports within the `newPhyHandler` function, improving code clarity and ensuring all ports have a default status.  This is the most significant change in the log.

Another minor edit removes a `// todo:` comment from the `updatePhyLedStatus` function, indicating a step toward completing the function's implementation.  The code consistently interacts with C libraries (indicated by `C.` prefix) for obtaining PHY port status information and updates the LED states through an `externals` interface.  The code also handles different port types (RJ45 or MAC) and maps C library return values to Go data structures.  The constant `totalPorts` is hardcoded to 10, although the comment suggests this should ideally be chassis-specific.


## 12:12:28 PM
The log shows two updates to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file, both at approximately 11:35 AM and 11:36 AM on July 10, 2025.  The content of these files is almost identical, configuring SSH access to various hosts.  The hosts are named `10.27.35.27`, `cnesbitt_dvm`, and `cnesbitt_dvm_arm`, `cnesbitt_dvm_feature`, `cnesbitt_dvm_develop`, `cnesbitt_dvm_6.1`, `cnesbitt_dvm_6.2`, `cnesbitt_dvm_6.3`, and `cnesbitt_dvm_el9`.  Each entry specifies the hostname, username (`centos` or `cnesbitt`), and the IdentityFile used for authentication (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).  Several entries also specify a non-standard port.  The second `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file update shows no net change compared to the first.

A single update to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` occurred at 11:36:25 AM on July 10, 2025. This file contains a list of known hosts and their public keys, using various algorithms (ssh-ed25519, ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256).  Many of the IP addresses (10.27.x.x)  correspond to those in the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file, but there are other entries as well.  The repeated presence of certain keys suggests that there might be multiple entries for a particular host or that some keys are shared between various servers.
