# Activity Summary for 7/10/2025

## 11:42:30 AM
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/phy_led_handler.go` between 10:53 AM and 10:56 AM on July 10, 2025.  The file is a Go program that handles physical (PHY) LED status updates.

The primary changes center around the initialization of `lastPhyStates` in the `newPhyHandler` function.  Initially, this map was initialized implicitly (only by creating it). Later revisions explicitly initialize `lastPhyStates` to a default state for all 10 ports within the `newPhyHandler` function, improving code clarity and ensuring all ports have a default status.  This is the most significant change in the log.

Another minor edit removes a `// todo:` comment from the `updatePhyLedStatus` function, indicating a step toward completing the function's implementation.  The code consistently interacts with C libraries (indicated by `C.` prefix) for obtaining PHY port status information and updates the LED states through an `externals` interface.  The code also handles different port types (RJ45 or MAC) and maps C library return values to Go data structures.  The constant `totalPorts` is hardcoded to 10, although the comment suggests this should ideally be chassis-specific.


## 12:12:28 PM
The log shows two updates to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file, both at approximately 11:35 AM and 11:36 AM on July 10, 2025.  The content of these files is almost identical, configuring SSH access to various hosts.  The hosts are named `10.27.35.27`, `cnesbitt_dvm`, and `cnesbitt_dvm_arm`, `cnesbitt_dvm_feature`, `cnesbitt_dvm_develop`, `cnesbitt_dvm_6.1`, `cnesbitt_dvm_6.2`, `cnesbitt_dvm_6.3`, and `cnesbitt_dvm_el9`.  Each entry specifies the hostname, username (`centos` or `cnesbitt`), and the IdentityFile used for authentication (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).  Several entries also specify a non-standard port.  The second `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file update shows no net change compared to the first.

A single update to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` occurred at 11:36:25 AM on July 10, 2025. This file contains a list of known hosts and their public keys, using various algorithms (ssh-ed25519, ssh-rsa, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256).  Many of the IP addresses (10.27.x.x)  correspond to those in the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file, but there are other entries as well.  The repeated presence of certain keys suggests that there might be multiple entries for a particular host or that some keys are shared between various servers.


## 3:29:21 PM
The code changes primarily involve the development of a heartbeat monitoring system within a `ChassisManager` application.

On July 10, 2025, at 2:35:43 PM, the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat_interface.go` was updated. This update defined an interface, `HeartbeatInterface`, with methods for running the heartbeat (`Run`), retrieving health status (`GetHealth`), and setting health status (`setHealth`).  An enumerated type `HeartbeatHealth` was also defined representing different system health states (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService).

Shortly after, at 2:36:32 PM, the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat_test.go` was modified.  This commit includes the beginnings of a unit test (`TestHeartbeatMonitor`) for the heartbeat functionality. The test uses a `dummyHeartbeatResponse` struct to simulate HTTP responses and currently has a placeholder comment (`// todo: implement the test logic`).  The test setup suggests the heartbeat monitor interacts with a remote service via HTTP requests.  The use of a dummy response allows for controlled testing of error scenarios. Both files include copyright information for Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025.


## 4:29:11 PM
The log shows two entries for `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`, both at approximately the same time (7/10/2025, 4:16 PM).  The code itself is identical in both entries. The `ChassisMonitor` class is designed to monitor chassis temperatures, fetching data from  "http://localhost/api/chassis/temperature/threshold" and "http://localhost/api/v1/chassis/temperature" using a Unix socket connection to "./chassis-manager.sock".  It handles JSON responses, parsing temperature thresholds and actual temperatures.  The class also includes a heartbeat function (`handleChassisHeartbeat`) that checks for major or critical alarms in the system, affecting the reported health status.  A retry mechanism with a 20-second timeout is implemented for handling connection failures.  The code uses the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON handling and logging is extensively used via `TraceLog`, `DebugLog`, and `WarningLog`. The only difference between the two log entries is the timestamp, suggesting a possible duplicate entry or a minor, undetectable change.


## 7:29:11 PM
The provided code log shows multiple revisions of a Go file (`leopard_cpld.go`) managing LEDs on a Leopard system.  The key changes across the revisions are minor and primarily involve renaming variables and constants for improved clarity and consistency.

The first revision (4:59:45 PM) establishes the initial code structure, defining constants for CPLD file paths, LED colors, and modes.  It also includes functions to set system and PHY LED statuses based on various input parameters (e.g., `LedPattern`, `HeartbeatHealth`, `PhyStatus`).  The `setLeopardSystemLEDFromBlinkCode` function uses a switch statement to handle different LED patterns based on manufacturing and network status codes.

Subsequent revisions (5:01:10 PM, 5:01:58 PM, 5:04:34 PM) introduce subtle changes.  Specifically, some constants related to LED colors (`ledGreen`, `ledAmber`, `ledRed`, `ledWhite`, `ledPurple`, `ledTeal`) are renamed to improve readability by removing underscores from the names.  There is also a renaming of the variable `cpld_phy_leds` to `cpldPhyLeds` (5:04:34 PM) following a camel case naming convention.  The core functionality remains unchanged. The changes occurred within a short time frame suggesting iterative refinements rather than major feature additions or bug fixes.
