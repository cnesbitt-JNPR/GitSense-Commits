# Activity Summary for 7/11/2025

## 3:12:58 PM
The provided log shows modifications to two Go files: `leopard_cpld.go` and `heartbeat.go`.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopard_cpld.go` underwent several revisions between 2:14:58 PM and 2:16:32 PM on July 11, 2025.  These changes primarily involved the `leopardLedWriter` struct.  Initially, it included a `freqBrightness` field.  This field was subsequently commented out (marked as unused for Leopard CPLD) in the final revision. No other significant structural changes were made; most edits were minor and likely related to code cleanup or clarification. The file manages LED updates, specifically for a device called "Leopard CPLD," interacting with system files in `/sys/kernel/leopard_cpld/`.  The code extensively uses constants to define LED control parameters and includes functions to set LED color, brightness, blink patterns, and modes.  Multiple functions handle different LED status codes (manufacturing, IP/DNS related).

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go` was modified between 3:00:28 PM and 3:07:15 PM on July 11, 2025. The main changes in this file were improvements to logging within the `heartbeatChecker` function. Earlier versions lacked detailed logging for different health statuses.  The final version added `log.Infof` for "InService" status and improved log messages to include the string "Heartbeat check:" as a prefix for better readability. The file implements a `HeartbeatMonitor` which regularly checks the health of an SSR (likely a system or service) via a Unix socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock`. The `HeartbeatMonitor` has different states, including Booting, InService, DegradedService, and OutOfService.  It uses a retry mechanism (`maxInitializationAttempts`, `maxReconnectionAttempts`) to handle potential connection failures.  The health information is fetched via a JSON API endpoint (`/api/v1/chassis/heartbeat`).


## 5:15:31 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go` between 7/11/2025, 3:33:09 PM and 7/11/2025, 3:45:42 PM.  These revisions appear to be minor, with the most significant change being in `handleHeartbeatResponse` function where the `responseJson` struct's `isHealthy` field is renamed to `healthy`. No functional changes are observed across these revisions.

A separate file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopard_cpld.go`, was updated twice, at 7/11/2025, 4:58:24 PM and 7/11/2025, 5:09:13 PM. This file manages LED control for a Leopard system, defining functions to set system and PHY LED statuses based on various codes and health states.  The changes between these two revisions are not apparent from a simple code comparison.

Finally, a C++ file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`, was modified at 7/11/2025, 5:03:07 PM.  This file handles monitoring chassis temperatures and reporting the status via a unix socket connection to a chassis manager. It fetches temperature thresholds and actual temperatures, handling potential failures and updating the system state accordingly.  A heartbeat function (`handleChassisHeartbeat`) checks for major or critical alarms to determine the overall health of the system.
