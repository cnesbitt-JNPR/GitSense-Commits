# Activity Summary for 7/14/2025

## 10:19:45 AM
The log shows updates to three files across a short timeframe on July 14, 2025.  The most significant changes are in `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`**: This file underwent multiple revisions.  The first two revisions (9:38:32 AM and 9:42:40 AM) show minor internal code cleanup.  A comment  `// todo: any formatting needed?` was removed from the `parseChassisTemperatureThresholdsResponse` and `parseChassisTemperaturesResponse` functions in the second revision. The final revision (9:54:10 AM) changes the path of `chassisManagerSocket` from `./chassis-manager.sock` to `/var/run/128technology/chassis-manager.sock`, indicating a change in the socket location used for communication.  This file focuses on monitoring chassis temperatures and health by fetching data, parsing JSON responses, and updating the system state accordingly.  Error handling and retry logic are implemented for robust operation.  The code interacts with a `ChassisManager` service via Unix sockets for temperature data and threshold information.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat.go`**: This Go file, updated at 9:48:28 AM, implements a heartbeat monitor that checks the health of an SSR (likely Software Switch Router) at regular intervals (3-second intervals after initialization). It uses a Unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock`) to communicate with a `NodeMonitor` service. The monitor reports health states (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService), logs health transitions, and includes retry logic.  The file includes test capabilities through `NewTestHeartbeatMonitor`.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopard_cpld.go`**: Updated at 9:51:45 AM, this Go file manages LED updates on a "Leopard CPLD" (likely a Complex Programmable Logic Device). It defines functions to control LED brightness, color, and blinking patterns based on system health or manufacturing status (using codes from an `api` package).  The code interacts with the system through `/sys/kernel/leopard_cpld/` files, indicating direct hardware access.  The file uses numerous helper functions to configure LED settings, including functions for various blink codes and health states.

In summary, the changes reflect work on a system monitoring and control application. The `ChassisMonitor` C++ code retrieves chassis information, while the Go code manages system heartbeat checks and LED indicators based on the health of the system. The updates are focused on improving error handling, refining communication paths, and enhancing the LED control logic.


## 11:19:44 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/server_io.go` files between 11:11 AM and 11:19 AM on July 14, 2025.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go` file underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on refining the API routes.  Initial versions had several `TODO` comments indicating planned additions like bandwidth limiters and fan control.  Subsequent changes added a new route `/led/ports` to retrieve all port LEDs, and improved the existing LED API endpoints. The changes consistently involved adding new functions to handle various LED and temperature-related API requests.  These functions all follow a similar pattern: they use a `timeouts` struct to manage request timeouts, obtain necessary context information via middleware, call corresponding functions in the `Handler` (introduced in a separate file), and return JSON responses using helper functions.

The most significant changes happened between 11:12 AM and 11:17 AM, reflecting the evolution and expansion of the API's LED-related functionalities.  The final commit at 11:17 AM reflects a more complete and organized API structure for managing LEDs.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/server_io.go` file was modified to change the return type of `GetPhyStates` from a tuple to a map.  This occurred between 11:19 AM and 11:20 AM. This modification suggests a change in how PHY LED states are managed internally, likely moving to a more organized map-based representation.  The changes are relatively minor, mostly affecting how PHY LED states are accessed and returned.


## 1:20:12 PM
The log shows a series of code changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager` project, specifically focusing on the `server/handler.go` and `led` package.  The changes span approximately 20 minutes between 11:20 AM and 11:44 AM on July 14, 2025.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go`:**

This file underwent significant revisions related to LED handling.  Initially, many functions were stubs (`GetAllLeds`, `GetTempThresholds`, `GetSensorTempThreshold`, `GetAllPower`, `GetComponentPower`, `GetFanStatus`).  Subsequent changes focused on improving the `GetAllPortLeds` function.  The initial version contained redundant code. This was refactored  into `phyStatusToJson` and then further refactored into `phyStatusToMap` helper functions around 11:25 AM and 11:34 AM respectively,  These helper functions are marked with `// todo, move this out to a nested package?`, suggesting a planned reorganization.  Finally, at 11:44 AM,  `GetAllLeds` was substantially rewritten to handle both system and port LEDs more efficiently, separating their handling into distinct sections using `systemLedToMap` and `phyStatesToMap`. The error messages were also improved throughout this file's evolution.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/server_io.go`:**

A single commit at 11:42 AM modified this file. The change introduced a `ServerIO` struct with a request queue (`RequestQueue`), mutex (`ledMu`),  and functionality for managing system and PHY LEDs (`systemLED`, `phyStates`).  This suggests the implementation of a concurrent LED update mechanism, with the `ServerIO` acting as an intermediary between the server and the LED manager.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go`:**

This file, modified at 11:43 AM, shows the server setup and routing. It uses the `chi` router to define API endpoints for LED status, temperature readings, power, firmware, and hardware information.  The code includes timeouts for queries and updates and uses a custom HTTP client capable of handling Unix domain sockets.  The routing section demonstrates endpoints for retrieving various system information, including the use of middleware (`chassisMiddleware`) for validation.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/cpss_api_other.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/cpss_api_arm64.go`:**

These files handle LED interactions with the underlying hardware, specifically focusing on ARM and ARM64 architectures.  `cpss_api_other.go` provides stubs for functions that only need implementation on the ARM64 architecture. `cpss_api_arm64.go` contains the actual implementation, interacting with the CPSS API to get and set LED states. The functions in this file extract information like link status, speed and duplex. This indicates a platform-specific implementation using the CPSS API.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/BUILD.bazel`:**

This `BUILD.bazel` file, updated at 1:19 PM, describes the build rules for the `led` package, revealing its dependencies on other packages within the Chassis Manager project and external libraries.  The use of `cgo` and compiler/linker options (`clinkopts`, `copts`) indicates that the `led` package utilizes C code, potentially for low-level hardware interactions, and specifies the inclusion paths for ARM and ARM64 systems.


**`Untitled-4`:**

This file shows two empty commits, indicating potentially temporary files or commits that were later reverted or discarded.  They do not provide any useful information for summarizing the code changes.


## 4:19:53 PM
The log shows extensive development on a Chassis Manager's LED control system, primarily focusing on the `led` package and its sub-packages.  Significant changes occurred between 2:40 PM and 4:20 PM on July 14, 2025.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/` directory underwent substantial refactoring.  Initially, the `led_io` package contained `common.go`, `manager_externals_interface.go`, and `server_io.go`.  This was later reorganized into a `led_common` package with the same files plus a new `state_file.go`, which handles persistent storage for blink codes (though the implementation is marked as TODO).  The `led_io` package became a thin wrapper around `led_common`.

The `manager_externals_mock.go` file, used for testing, was updated multiple times to reflect changes in the `led_common` package and to use the new naming conventions for methods (e.g., changing from `setSystemLED` to `SetSystemLED`).  The `MockHeartbeatMonitor` within this file was also improved.

The `leopard_v1` package, specific to a Leopard V1 chassis, contains the implementation details for setting system and PHY LEDs.  The `leopard_cpld.go` file defines constants and functions interacting with the CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device) to control the LEDs, mapping LED statuses to specific color and blink patterns.

The `heartbeat` package, responsible for monitoring the system health, underwent substantial updates to the `heartbeat.go` file, primarily to improve the handling of the HTTP response from the NodeMonitor, and to add error handling for `io.ReadAll`.  A corresponding `heartbeat_test.go` file was added but remains largely unimplemented.  There was also an update to the `HeartbeatInterface` changing the `setHealth` method to `SetHealth` in `heartbeat_interface.go`.

The `phy` package, dealing with physical port LEDs, is implemented using cgo for interaction with a C library. `phy_cpss_api_arm64.go` contains the ARM64-specific implementation, while `phy_cpss_api_other.go` is a stub for other architectures. The `phy_led_handler.go` file manages the updates to the physical LEDs, using the `led_common` package's structs.  The `newPhyHandler` function was renamed to `NewPhyHandler`.

Throughout the code, a consistent pattern emerges in the renaming of functions and structs to use UpperCamelCase, indicating a move towards more standardized Go conventions.  Many functions still have TODO comments, indicating ongoing development and areas requiring further implementation. The `led_common` package acts as a central point, providing common interfaces and types used throughout the LED management system.
