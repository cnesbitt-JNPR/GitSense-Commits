# Activity Summary for 7/15/2025

## 11:00:16 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go` file between 10:53:17 AM and 10:55:05 AM on July 15, 2025.  The changes are minor and primarily involve refinements to the `handleHeartbeatResponse` function.

Specifically, the first revision at 10:53:17 AM contains the initial code. The second revision at 10:53:33 AM is identical to the first one.  The third revision at 10:53:51 AM moves the `log.Debugf` statement  after the empty response body check, improving the code's logic. The final revision at 10:55:05 AM adds a "todo" comment to the `log.Debugf` line, suggesting a future plan to potentially remove or adjust it for noise reduction, indicating ongoing development and debugging.

The code defines a heartbeat monitor (`Monitor` struct) that periodically checks the health of an SSR (presumably a Juniper Networks system) via a NodeMonitor service using a Unix socket.  The monitor reports health statuses (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService) and includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms.  The use of `context.Context` and timeout shows consideration for proper resource management and cancellation.  The `heartbeatChecker` function employs a retry mechanism for initializing the heartbeat and subsequent reconnections. No other files were modified in the log.


## 12:00:14 PM
The log shows several updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` and one update to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp`.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` Updates:**

Three updates occurred between 11:22:31 AM and 11:23:33 AM on July 15, 2025.  The changes are minor and incremental.  The core functionality remains consistent: fetching and parsing chassis temperature data from a local chassis manager via a Unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/chassis-manager.sock`) and HTTP requests to `http://localhost/api/chassis/temperature/thresholds` and `http://localhost/api/chassis/temperatures`.  The data is then written to the system state.

The primary difference between the revisions lies within the `parseChassisResponseJson` function.  Initially, it only checked for valid JSON and object structure.  Subsequent commits added a check for empty responses, logging a warning message if the JSON body is empty.  This enhancement improves error handling and logging.  There are no other significant functional changes.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp` Update:**

A single update occurred at 11:26:12 AM on July 15, 2025, to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp`. This file contains a `StateDataParser` class responsible for parsing various types of state data.  The update likely expands the parser's capabilities to handle new data types.  Specifically, the `populateParseFunctions` method registers additional parser functions, adding support for:  `systemChassisManagerTemperatures`, which parses chassis temperature data, and other functionalities not readily apparent from the provided code snippet.  The `parseChassisManagerTemperatures` function specifically handles parsing and extracting temperature information, categorizing sensors based on yellow and red temperature thresholds.


## 2:00:15 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: the code monitors chassis temperatures, fetches data from a chassis manager via a Unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/chassis-manager.sock`) and HTTP (`http://localhost/api/chassis/...`), parses the JSON response, and updates the system state accordingly.  A heartbeat function checks for major or critical alarms to determine overall system health.

The significant changes across the revisions are minor and primarily focused on logging and error handling within the `hasMajorOrCriticalAlarms` function.

* **7/15/2025, 1:08:42 PM:** Initial commit of the `ChassisMonitor` class.

* **7/15/2025, 1:09:21 PM - 7/15/2025, 1:09:50 PM:**  These revisions involve enhancements to logging within the `hasMajorOrCriticalAlarms` function.  Specifically, the addition of logging statements that output the name and severity of any found Major/Critical alarms.  These edits are incremental, refining the diagnostic information provided by the logs.

* **7/15/2025, 1:19:25 PM:**  A minor change in the `hasMajorOrCriticalAlarms` function where `alarmInfo.getName()` is replaced with `alarmInfo.getMessage()`.  This suggests a switch from using alarm names to alarm messages for logging purposes.

* **7/15/2025, 1:21:40 PM:** The final revision updates the `hasMajorOrCriticalAlarms` function again, changing `state::SeverityTraits::toStdString` to `trait::to_string`. This suggests a potential refactoring or namespace change related to severity representation.

In summary, the code undergoes iterative refinement focused on improving logging detail and clarity within alarm handling, without altering its core functionality.  The timestamps indicate a short period of active development and debugging, particularly around alarm logging.


## 6:00:12 PM
The provided log shows three revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`.  All revisions involve the same file, focusing on chassis temperature monitoring.  No changes were observed between the first and second revision.

The most significant change occurred between the second and third revisions (timestamp: 7/15/2025, 3:36:56 PM). This revision modified the `hasMajorOrCriticalAlarms` function.  Specifically, the line `const auto& alarmTable = stateObjects.getAlarmTable();` was replaced with `const auto& alarmTable = state::TableRegistry::getAlarmTable();`. This indicates a refactoring of how the alarm table is accessed, likely moving to a more centralized or global registry.  The rest of the code remains consistent across all revisions,  consistently fetching and parsing chassis temperature thresholds and temperatures from  `http://localhost/api/chassis/temperature/thresholds` and `http://localhost/api/chassis/temperatures` respectively using a Unix socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/chassis-manager.sock`.  The code includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms for network failures.  The application writes temperature information to a state object and indicates disconnections.  A heartbeat mechanism checks for major or critical alarms to determine overall system health.
