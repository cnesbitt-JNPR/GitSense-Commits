# Activity Summary for 7/15/2025

## 11:00:16 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go` file between 10:53:17 AM and 10:55:05 AM on July 15, 2025.  The changes are minor and primarily involve refinements to the `handleHeartbeatResponse` function.

Specifically, the first revision at 10:53:17 AM contains the initial code. The second revision at 10:53:33 AM is identical to the first one.  The third revision at 10:53:51 AM moves the `log.Debugf` statement  after the empty response body check, improving the code's logic. The final revision at 10:55:05 AM adds a "todo" comment to the `log.Debugf` line, suggesting a future plan to potentially remove or adjust it for noise reduction, indicating ongoing development and debugging.

The code defines a heartbeat monitor (`Monitor` struct) that periodically checks the health of an SSR (presumably a Juniper Networks system) via a NodeMonitor service using a Unix socket.  The monitor reports health statuses (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService) and includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms.  The use of `context.Context` and timeout shows consideration for proper resource management and cancellation.  The `heartbeatChecker` function employs a retry mechanism for initializing the heartbeat and subsequent reconnections. No other files were modified in the log.


## 12:00:14 PM
The log shows several updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` and one update to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp`.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` Updates:**

Three updates occurred between 11:22:31 AM and 11:23:33 AM on July 15, 2025.  The changes are minor and incremental.  The core functionality remains consistent: fetching and parsing chassis temperature data from a local chassis manager via a Unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/chassis-manager.sock`) and HTTP requests to `http://localhost/api/chassis/temperature/thresholds` and `http://localhost/api/chassis/temperatures`.  The data is then written to the system state.

The primary difference between the revisions lies within the `parseChassisResponseJson` function.  Initially, it only checked for valid JSON and object structure.  Subsequent commits added a check for empty responses, logging a warning message if the JSON body is empty.  This enhancement improves error handling and logging.  There are no other significant functional changes.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp` Update:**

A single update occurred at 11:26:12 AM on July 15, 2025, to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp`. This file contains a `StateDataParser` class responsible for parsing various types of state data.  The update likely expands the parser's capabilities to handle new data types.  Specifically, the `populateParseFunctions` method registers additional parser functions, adding support for:  `systemChassisManagerTemperatures`, which parses chassis temperature data, and other functionalities not readily apparent from the provided code snippet.  The `parseChassisManagerTemperatures` function specifically handles parsing and extracting temperature information, categorizing sensors based on yellow and red temperature thresholds.
