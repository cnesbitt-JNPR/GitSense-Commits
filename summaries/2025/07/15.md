# Activity Summary for 7/15/2025

## 11:00:16 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go` file between 10:53:17 AM and 10:55:05 AM on July 15, 2025.  The changes are minor and primarily involve refinements to the `handleHeartbeatResponse` function.

Specifically, the first revision at 10:53:17 AM contains the initial code. The second revision at 10:53:33 AM is identical to the first one.  The third revision at 10:53:51 AM moves the `log.Debugf` statement  after the empty response body check, improving the code's logic. The final revision at 10:55:05 AM adds a "todo" comment to the `log.Debugf` line, suggesting a future plan to potentially remove or adjust it for noise reduction, indicating ongoing development and debugging.

The code defines a heartbeat monitor (`Monitor` struct) that periodically checks the health of an SSR (presumably a Juniper Networks system) via a NodeMonitor service using a Unix socket.  The monitor reports health statuses (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService) and includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms.  The use of `context.Context` and timeout shows consideration for proper resource management and cancellation.  The `heartbeatChecker` function employs a retry mechanism for initializing the heartbeat and subsequent reconnections. No other files were modified in the log.
