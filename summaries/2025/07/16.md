# Activity Summary for 7/16/2025

## 10:01:39 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.hpp` files between 9:19 AM and 9:56 AM on July 16, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on improving the `ChassisMonitor` class, which appears to monitor chassis temperatures and report on system health.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` Updates:**

* **Early Changes (9:19 AM - 9:26 AM):** Initial implementation of the `ChassisMonitor` class, including functions to fetch and parse chassis temperature thresholds and temperatures from a chassis manager ("`http://localhost/api/chassis/temperature/thresholds`", "`http://localhost/api/chassis/temperatures`").  The code uses a Unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/chassis-manager.sock`) for communication and includes retry logic with a 20-second timeout for failed connections.  The `hasMajorOrCriticalAlarms` function is stubbed out with a `TODO` comment.  There's a `consecutiveFailureCount` variable to track connection failures, resulting in a "Chassis Disconnected" state being written to the system.  The code uses the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON handling.

* **Concurrency Control (9:32 AM - 9:34 AM):** A `std::mutex` named `temperatureMutex` is added to protect shared access to `temperatures` data.  This indicates that concurrent access to temperature data is a concern.

* **`hasTempsAboveThresholds` Function Refinement (9:42 AM - 9:52 AM):** The `hasTempsAboveThresholds` function, initially a placeholder, is implemented to check if any chassis temperatures exceed their respective yellow thresholds.  The logic iterates through temperatures and compares them to thresholds retrieved from the `thresholds` data structure.  The function also now includes explicit checks for `temperatures` and `thresholds` being null.  The log level for reporting unavailable temperatures changes from `DebugLog` to `TraceLog`.

* **`handleChassisHeartbeat` Function Enhancement (9:49 AM - 9:52 AM):** The `handleChassisHeartbeat` function is modified to consider chassis temperatures exceeding thresholds as an unhealthy state, in addition to the existence of major/critical alarms.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.hpp` Updates:**

* The header file is updated to reflect the addition of the `hasTempsAboveThresholds` function (9:21 AM and 9:22 AM).  The `temperatures` member variable is added and the `consecutiveFailureCount` variable's purpose is less explicitly tied to the variable's declaration.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp` Updates:**

* A test file is added (9:56 AM) containing unit tests for `ChassisMonitor`. These tests verify initialization, handling of disconnected states, temperature updates and retrieval, threshold loading, and the chassis heartbeat functionality.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Consistent use of logging macros (`TraceLog`, `DebugLog`, `WarningLog`).
* Extensive use of the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON manipulation.
* Error handling with explicit checks for `isNull` conditions and appropriate logging.
* The use of a Unix socket for communication with the chassis manager.
* Gradual refinement of the `hasTempsAboveThresholds` and `handleChassisHeartbeat` functions showing an iterative development process.  The initial placeholder functions evolve into functional implementations that consider specific thresholds and conditions for determining the system's health.

The overall evolution of the code suggests a focus on robust temperature monitoring and system health reporting, with improvements in error handling and concurrency.  The testing indicates a thorough approach to verifying functionality.
