# Activity Summary for 7/18/2025

## 1:24:37 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/` directory, primarily focusing on the `manager.go` file which handles LED updates.  The `common.go` file defines data structures for LED patterns and physical port status, while `manager_factory.go` handles the creation of the LED manager based on the system's SKU.  `leopardv1/leopard_cpld.go` contains the hardware-specific implementation for LED control on Leopard devices.  `manager_externals_mock.go` provides mock implementations for unit testing.

The `common.go` file underwent several minor revisions between 7/18/2025, 9:36:43 AM and 7/18/2025, 10:13:53 AM, primarily clarifying comments and improving the description of the `Pattern()` function which maps `HeartbeatHealth` to LED colors (Teal, Green, Amber, Red).  A final change at 10:23:47 AM further refines the descriptions to specify "Solid" colors.

The `manager.go` file saw significant changes between 7/18/2025, 9:40:53 AM and 7/18/2025, 10:08:41 AM. These modifications involved improving the main loop's sleep mechanism in the `Run` function.  Initially, the sleep duration was based on the `PatternDuration` function, later modified to a fixed 1-second sleep or the remaining time in the LED pattern cycle using `math.Min()`.   The `shutdown` function was also enhanced to explicitly set the LED to solid amber when shutting down, unless a blink code is already active. The `processSystemLED` function incorporates logic to handle queued LED updates, resolving conflicts between multiple blink codes using a "first come first serve" approach (although the code includes TODOs indicating the need for a more sophisticated approach to resolve active blink codes).

Between 7/18/2025, 11:13:49 AM and 7/18/2025, 11:30:04 AM the `manager_factory.go` file was modified to dynamically select the appropriate LED manager externals based on the system's SKU.  Initially, it hardcoded `leopardv1` externals,  later switching to a conditional approach to select `leopardv1` for "SSR400" and "SSR440" SKUs,  otherwise defaulting to a mock implementation (`NewMockManagerExternals()`).  The SKU parsing was also refined to take only the first element from split SKU.

The `api.go` file received a substantial update at 7/18/2025, 10:23:30 AM, adding a `Pattern()` function to translate `LedStatus` to specific color patterns (e.g., "Teal - Amber," "3x Amber"). This file's primary function is to define constants and enums related to the chassis manager's API, particularly focusing on LED status codes and their string representations.  Further changes at 10:32:42 AM significantly expanded the mapping of `LedStatus` to color patterns, providing a more detailed definition for numerous error conditions.

Finally, the `leopardv1/leopard_cpld.go` file, managing the hardware interaction, was extensively modified between 7/18/2025, 11:36:45 AM and 7/18/2025, 1:05:53 PM. These changes involved a substantial expansion of the `setLeopardSystemLEDFromBlinkCode` function to handle different `api.LedStatus` codes with specific color patterns and blink rates. The `getLeopardSystemPatternDuration` function was also updated to calculate durations more accurately based on the active blink code, taking into account blink and off periods. The comments were improved and some unused functions were commented out.

In summary, the code changes reflect a development process involving initial implementation, refinement of timing and error handling in the main LED management logic, and finally a significant extension of the LED status codes and mappings for more detailed diagnostics on different devices.  The use of mock objects for testing is also evident.
