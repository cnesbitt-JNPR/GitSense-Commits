# Activity Summary for 7/18/2025

## 1:24:37 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/` directory, primarily focusing on the `manager.go` file which handles LED updates.  The `common.go` file defines data structures for LED patterns and physical port status, while `manager_factory.go` handles the creation of the LED manager based on the system's SKU.  `leopardv1/leopard_cpld.go` contains the hardware-specific implementation for LED control on Leopard devices.  `manager_externals_mock.go` provides mock implementations for unit testing.

The `common.go` file underwent several minor revisions between 7/18/2025, 9:36:43 AM and 7/18/2025, 10:13:53 AM, primarily clarifying comments and improving the description of the `Pattern()` function which maps `HeartbeatHealth` to LED colors (Teal, Green, Amber, Red).  A final change at 10:23:47 AM further refines the descriptions to specify "Solid" colors.

The `manager.go` file saw significant changes between 7/18/2025, 9:40:53 AM and 7/18/2025, 10:08:41 AM. These modifications involved improving the main loop's sleep mechanism in the `Run` function.  Initially, the sleep duration was based on the `PatternDuration` function, later modified to a fixed 1-second sleep or the remaining time in the LED pattern cycle using `math.Min()`.   The `shutdown` function was also enhanced to explicitly set the LED to solid amber when shutting down, unless a blink code is already active. The `processSystemLED` function incorporates logic to handle queued LED updates, resolving conflicts between multiple blink codes using a "first come first serve" approach (although the code includes TODOs indicating the need for a more sophisticated approach to resolve active blink codes).

Between 7/18/2025, 11:13:49 AM and 7/18/2025, 11:30:04 AM the `manager_factory.go` file was modified to dynamically select the appropriate LED manager externals based on the system's SKU.  Initially, it hardcoded `leopardv1` externals,  later switching to a conditional approach to select `leopardv1` for "SSR400" and "SSR440" SKUs,  otherwise defaulting to a mock implementation (`NewMockManagerExternals()`).  The SKU parsing was also refined to take only the first element from split SKU.

The `api.go` file received a substantial update at 7/18/2025, 10:23:30 AM, adding a `Pattern()` function to translate `LedStatus` to specific color patterns (e.g., "Teal - Amber," "3x Amber"). This file's primary function is to define constants and enums related to the chassis manager's API, particularly focusing on LED status codes and their string representations.  Further changes at 10:32:42 AM significantly expanded the mapping of `LedStatus` to color patterns, providing a more detailed definition for numerous error conditions.

Finally, the `leopardv1/leopard_cpld.go` file, managing the hardware interaction, was extensively modified between 7/18/2025, 11:36:45 AM and 7/18/2025, 1:05:53 PM. These changes involved a substantial expansion of the `setLeopardSystemLEDFromBlinkCode` function to handle different `api.LedStatus` codes with specific color patterns and blink rates. The `getLeopardSystemPatternDuration` function was also updated to calculate durations more accurately based on the active blink code, taking into account blink and off periods. The comments were improved and some unused functions were commented out.

In summary, the code changes reflect a development process involving initial implementation, refinement of timing and error handling in the main LED management logic, and finally a significant extension of the LED status codes and mappings for more detailed diagnostics on different devices.  The use of mock objects for testing is also evident.


## 2:24:13 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld.go` file between 1:36 PM and 1:45 PM on July 18, 2025.  The file contains Go code that manages LED control for a "Leopard" system, likely some type of hardware device.

The core functionality involves mapping different status codes (e.g., `api.ManufacturingInProgress`, `api.NoIPAddress`, `api.CloudUnreachable`) to specific LED blink patterns.  Each status code is associated with a `leopardLedWriter` struct which defines LED color (`color1`, `color2`), blink counts (`ctrlX`, `ctrlY`), blink rate (`blinkRate`), and off period (`offPeriod`).

The most significant changes occurred in the comments within the `setLeopardSystemLEDFromBlinkCode` function.  Initially, the comment section described a blink rate of 500ms and an off period of 1s. This was later updated to 500ms blink rate and 750ms off period in subsequent commits, indicating a refinement in timing calculations for the LED patterns.  The final version of the comment omits the off-period calculation for colorY and the final 500ms delay.  There are no structural code changes across the revisions; only the comments regarding timing are altered.  The code itself remains consistent in its overall functionality.


## 3:24:06 PM
The log shows several code changes across three files within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led` directory.  The primary focus appears to be on the `leopard_cpld.go` and `manager.go` files, which manage LED control, specifically for a "Leopard" system.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld.go`**: This file, updated multiple times between 2:54 PM and 3:09 PM, defines constants and functions for controlling LED behavior on the Leopard system's CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device).  It uses system calls to interact with the `/sys/kernel/leopard_cpld/` directory.  The code extensively maps different LED blink patterns to specific status codes (`api.LedStatus`), such as manufacturing progress, network connectivity issues, and cloud communication status.  A notable addition in the final commit to this file was a comment clarifying the calculation of the LED pattern duration, including a 500ms buffer for new blink code processing.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go`**: This file, updated repeatedly between 3:17 PM and 3:23 PM, contains the core LED management logic.  The `Manager` struct coordinates LED updates based on blink codes from a queue (`serverIO.RequestQueue`), and the system's heartbeat health.  Significant changes involve improvements to the sleep mechanism in the main loop (`Run` function). Initially, the `minDuration` function was used to determine sleep time, but it was replaced by `sleepTime`, which simplifies the logic and ensures a minimum sleep of 1 second.  The  `processRequestQueue` function handles incoming LED status updates, logging warnings for unknown senders and blink codes. The overall structure suggests a system designed for robust and reliable LED feedback.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/BUILD.bazel`**: This file, modified at 3:14 PM, is a Bazel build file. The changes indicate the addition of new files (`manager.go`, `manager_externals_mock.go`, `manager_factory.go`) and a test (`manager_test.go`).  This reflects organizational changes within the LED manager component.

In summary, the code changes represent a refinement of the LED management system for the Leopard hardware. The changes focused on improving the main loop's sleep mechanism, enhancing error handling, and clarifying the timing of LED patterns in the `leopard_cpld.go` file.  The additions and updates in the `manager.go` and  `BUILD.bazel` files suggest ongoing development and testing.


## 5:24:41 PM
The log shows code changes across multiple files within a Chassis Manager application, primarily focusing on LED management and temperature monitoring.  The most significant changes occur between 3:24 PM and 3:45 PM, and again around 4:11 PM to 4:31 PM.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_factory.go`:  This file underwent minor revisions between 3:24 PM and 3:24 PM, correcting a syntax error in the `NewLedManager` function; specifically, the assignment operator `=` was added to the `externals` variable assignment within the `switch` statement.  No other functional changes are observed.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/app/app.go`: This file contains the main application logic.  A significant change at 3:24 PM involves the initialization and running of the `Application` struct, which includes LED and temperature managers.  The `getTemperatureThresholds` function is notable for its handling of temperature threshold override files and fallback to default thresholds.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld.go`:  Modified at 3:35 PM, this file defines LED control functions specific to the "Leopard" hardware platform.  The code implements various LED patterns (`blinkingMode`, `solidMode`, etc.) associated with different system statuses (manufacturing, IP/DNS issues, cloud connectivity, configuration errors). A notable feature is a detailed switch statement mapping `api.LedStatus` codes to specific LED control configurations. The later revision at 3:35 PM contains no functional change.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go`:  This file, revised multiple times between 3:40 PM and 5:22 PM, contains the core LED manager logic.  Key changes include the addition of a `timerConfig` struct to better manage system and PHY LED updates; improved timer management with the addition of `timeRemaining` to the `timerConfig` struct and simplification of the timer structure in later revisions to `ledTimer` struct which removed `duration` and only keeps `sleepTime`. The code manages LED status based on blink codes from various senders and falls back to heartbeat health. There are numerous improvements to the code's structure and handling of timers, indicating an iterative refinement process.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp`: This C++ file, heavily modified between 4:11 PM and 4:31 PM, interacts with the Chassis Manager (Go application) to fetch and display temperature information.  The code fetches temperature thresholds and readings via HTTP requests using a Unix domain socket.  Error handling includes retry logic and setting a disconnected flag after multiple consecutive failures. The final revision simplifies the platform detection mechanism.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp`:  This C++ file, with revisions between 4:14 PM and 4:17 PM, shows the main NodeMonitor logic, encompassing CPU, memory, disk, and chassis statistics updates.  It uses the `ChassisMonitor` to get chassis temperature information.  The code includes a mechanism to monitor and report the NTP server status.  Revisions focus on code organization, particularly around conditional compilation for ARM platforms.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp`: This test file, modified between 4:32 PM and 4:38 PM, contains unit tests for the `ChassisMonitor` class.  Tests cover initialization, disconnected state handling, temperature monitoring, and heartbeat responses. The conditional compilation for leopard platform is added in a later version of this file.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp`: This header file, revised twice between 4:36 PM and 4:36 PM, provides a test harness for the `ChassisMonitor`.  It includes mock functions to simplify testing.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/CMakeLists.txt`: This file, modified at 4:40 PM, lists source files and libraries for building the NodeMonitor application.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/api/api.go`:  Updated at 4:43 PM and 4:50 PM, this file defines constants and enums used by the Chassis Manager API, including LED sender IDs and statuses.  The second update modifies the `Pattern` function for the `LedStatus` to include "Blinking:" prefix to better reflect the actual behavior of the LEDs.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/common/common.go`: Revised at 4:50 PM, 4:53 PM and 5:06 PM, this file contains common data structures and functions for LED management.  A noteworthy comment suggests a reconsideration of color assignments for different health states.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/CMakeLists.txt`: This CMakeLists.txt file, modified at 4:52 PM, lists source files and libraries for building the NodeMonitor unit tests.

In summary, the log reflects the development process of a system monitoring application and its interaction with a chassis management component. The focus is on LED control and temperature monitoring, with several iterations in the LED manager's logic around timer management and a final simplification. The C++ component responsible for interacting with the chassis manager also received significant updates, primarily focused on improving error handling and platform detection.
