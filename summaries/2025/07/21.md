# Activity Summary for 7/21/2025

## 1:26:50 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor` directory, focusing on the `NodeMonitor.cpp` and `ChassisMonitor.cpp` files and a related test harness.

**NodeMonitor.cpp:**  The primary changes in `NodeMonitor.cpp`  occurred between 1:11:42 PM and 1:12:23 PM.  These changes involved adding a call to `pChassisMonitor->updateChassisStats()` within the `updateSecondStats()` function. This suggests an integration of chassis monitoring into the NodeMonitor's second-level statistics update.  The code consistently uses the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON handling and data structures.  The file manages system resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk), NTP server status, and exposes several API endpoints (`/api/v1/version`, `/api/v1/platform/pciAddresses`, etc.).

**ChassisMonitor.cpp:** This file underwent extensive revision between 1:12:03 PM and 1:24:06 PM.  The initial version focused on fetching and parsing chassis temperature thresholds and temperatures from a `ChassisManager` via a Unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/chassis-manager.sock`).  Subsequent revisions added error handling for HTTP requests and improved the `handleChassisHeartbeat` function's response on non-Leopard platforms by returning appropriate HTTP error codes (`Method_Not_Allowed`).  A key change involved refactoring the `handleChassisHeartbeat` to use a helper function `resolveHeartbeatHealth` to determine the health status. The final revision moved the logging statements for  `handleChassisHeartbeat` to improve readability.  The code uses a mutex (`temperatureMutex`) to protect shared access to temperature data.  A recurring pattern is the use of helper functions for fetching, parsing, and writing data to the state.

**TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp:** The `TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp` file shows changes between 1:24:54 PM and 1:26:36 PM. This file introduces a test harness class that mocks the `ChassisManager` and state interactions for unit testing.  The main changes involve refactoring the functions to be `override` functions.  The test harness provides methods to inject dummy temperature thresholds and temperatures and to check the resulting state.


In summary, the code changes reflect the addition and refinement of chassis monitoring capabilities within the NodeMonitor application, particularly focusing on temperature monitoring and a heartbeat endpoint. The changes show a clear pattern of structured error handling, modular design using helper functions, and the use of a consistent JSON library. The test harness demonstrates a focus on thorough testing of the added functionality.
