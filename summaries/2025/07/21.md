# Activity Summary for 7/21/2025

## 1:26:50 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor` directory, focusing on the `NodeMonitor.cpp` and `ChassisMonitor.cpp` files and a related test harness.

**NodeMonitor.cpp:**  The primary changes in `NodeMonitor.cpp`  occurred between 1:11:42 PM and 1:12:23 PM.  These changes involved adding a call to `pChassisMonitor->updateChassisStats()` within the `updateSecondStats()` function. This suggests an integration of chassis monitoring into the NodeMonitor's second-level statistics update.  The code consistently uses the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON handling and data structures.  The file manages system resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk), NTP server status, and exposes several API endpoints (`/api/v1/version`, `/api/v1/platform/pciAddresses`, etc.).

**ChassisMonitor.cpp:** This file underwent extensive revision between 1:12:03 PM and 1:24:06 PM.  The initial version focused on fetching and parsing chassis temperature thresholds and temperatures from a `ChassisManager` via a Unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/chassis-manager.sock`).  Subsequent revisions added error handling for HTTP requests and improved the `handleChassisHeartbeat` function's response on non-Leopard platforms by returning appropriate HTTP error codes (`Method_Not_Allowed`).  A key change involved refactoring the `handleChassisHeartbeat` to use a helper function `resolveHeartbeatHealth` to determine the health status. The final revision moved the logging statements for  `handleChassisHeartbeat` to improve readability.  The code uses a mutex (`temperatureMutex`) to protect shared access to temperature data.  A recurring pattern is the use of helper functions for fetching, parsing, and writing data to the state.

**TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp:** The `TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp` file shows changes between 1:24:54 PM and 1:26:36 PM. This file introduces a test harness class that mocks the `ChassisManager` and state interactions for unit testing.  The main changes involve refactoring the functions to be `override` functions.  The test harness provides methods to inject dummy temperature thresholds and temperatures and to check the resulting state.


In summary, the code changes reflect the addition and refinement of chassis monitoring capabilities within the NodeMonitor application, particularly focusing on temperature monitoring and a heartbeat endpoint. The changes show a clear pattern of structured error handling, modular design using helper functions, and the use of a consistent JSON library. The test harness demonstrates a focus on thorough testing of the added functionality.


## 2:26:49 PM
The log shows modifications to code related to chassis monitoring and LED control on a Juniper Networks system.

**ChassisMonitor.hpp (7/21/2025, 1:26:54 PM):** This file defines the `ChassisMonitor` class, responsible for fetching and processing chassis temperature data and heartbeat information.  It uses `curl` for network requests, `dolly::dynamic` for JSON parsing, and interacts with a `state::Objects` object for storing system state. The class includes methods for fetching temperature thresholds and current temperatures from the chassis, parsing responses, updating state objects, and handling the heartbeat.  The move and copy constructors and assignment operators are deleted, suggesting a non-copyable/non-movable design.

**TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp (7/21/2025, 1:27:45 PM and 7/21/2025, 1:27:59 PM):** This file contains `TestHarnessChassisMonitor`, a unit testing harness for `ChassisMonitor`.  The two timestamps show a minor change:  `handleChassisHeartbeat` is renamed to `testHandleChassisHeartbeat`. The harness overrides methods in `ChassisMonitor` to simulate responses and bypass interactions with external systems (ChassisManager and State).  It provides setters for injecting dummy temperature data and thresholds for testing purposes and allows tests to check for a disconnected state and the presence of thresholds.

**ChassisMonitorTest.cpp (7/21/2025, 1:28:25 PM):** This file contains unit tests using Google Test (`gtest`) for `ChassisMonitor`.  The tests cover various scenarios including simple initialization and updates, handling disconnected states, reloading blank thresholds, managing blank temperature data, ensuring thresholds are only loaded once during initialization, and verifying temperature-based and alarm-based heartbeat behavior.  A large portion of the alarm-related test is commented out.  The test uses a test node name and initializes a `pattern::StackSafe<state::Objects>` object.  Extensive example data for temperatures and thresholds is also defined in this file.

**leopard_cpld.go (7/21/2025, 2:17:23 PM, 7/21/2025, 2:17:58 PM, 7/21/2025, 2:20:24 PM, 7/21/2025, 2:21:43 PM):** This Go file manages LED control on a Leopard system. Multiple revisions exist, with the only difference being a minor correction in a comment about the calculation for the pattern-end delay (changing from 999ms to 998ms). The file defines constants for interacting with system files in `/sys/kernel/leopard_cpld/`.  It maps various LED statuses (from an `api.LedStatus` enum) to specific color and blinking patterns using a `leopardLedWriter` struct and associated helper functions.  The code uses a switch statement to handle different LED status codes which are likely used to indicate system health or operational status.  The later revisions of this file refine the comment explaining the delay calculations.


## 3:26:50 PM
The code changes primarily concern the development and testing of a `ChassisMonitor` class responsible for monitoring chassis temperatures and reporting health status.  The changes span several files, focusing on LED control ( `leopard_cpld.go`) and Chassis monitoring (`ChassisMonitor.hpp`, `TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp`, `ChassisMonitorTest.cpp`).

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld.go`: This file underwent multiple revisions between 2:29 PM and 2:32 PM on July 21, 2025.  The revisions appear to be minor adjustments and likely bug fixes or code cleanup as there were no significant structural alterations. The core functionality remains the same: mapping different LED patterns to specific system states (Manufacturing, IP/DNS issues, Cloud connectivity issues, Config issues),  defined using color codes and blink patterns.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.hpp`: This header file declares the `ChassisMonitor` class.  The timestamp is 2:56:44 PM on July 21, 2025. The class uses the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON handling and interacts with a chassis manager via a unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/chassis-manager.sock`). It fetches temperature thresholds and actual temperatures, writes this data to the state, and determines overall system health based on these values and the presence of major/critical alarms.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp`: This file, timestamped 2:57:08 PM on July 21, 2025, contains a test harness class (`TestHarnessChassisMonitor`) that inherits from `ChassisMonitor`. This class overrides several methods to simulate responses from the chassis manager and state, enabling unit testing of the `ChassisMonitor` class.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp`: This file (updated at 2:58:10 PM, 2:59:23 PM, 2:59:42 PM, and 2:59:52 PM on July 21, 2025) includes several unit tests for the `ChassisMonitor` class. The tests cover scenarios like initialization, updates with different temperature data (including empty sets), handling of disconnected chassis manager and checking the health status based on temperature thresholds and alarms. The multiple timestamps suggest iterative development and debugging of the tests. The final revision shows a consistent use of `updateChassisStats` instead of `UpdateChassisStats`.

The recurring theme across all changes is the focus on robust error handling and thorough testing.  The code demonstrates a systematic approach to monitoring chassis health, including the use of retries, thresholds, and clear error messages, with substantial efforts invested in unit testing.


## 4:26:43 PM
The log shows several revisions to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go` on July 21, 2025.  The main focus of the changes appears to be refining the logging of API requests.

The initial revisions (3:49:21 PM, 3:50:08 PM, 3:50:43 PM)  demonstrate a stable codebase with functions for handling LED and temperature status requests via a Unix Domain Socket.  These functions consistently use timeouts for query and update operations and return JSON responses.  The code uses the `go-chi` router for handling API requests.  Multiple functions are present for retrieving LED information (all LEDs, system LED, port LEDs).  Similarly,  functions are included to handle temperature retrieval (temperatures, thresholds, sensors).  The server setup involves privileged socket creation using a custom `unix` package.

The significant change occurs between 3:50:43 PM and 4:21:56 PM. A `paramLogDenyList` variable is introduced to prevent logging of parameters for the `/api/chassis/monitor/stats` endpoint. This is explicitly done to reduce log verbosity due to frequent calls from the ChassisMonitor.

A minor clarification is added between 4:21:56 PM and 4:22:03 PM in the comment explaining why the `/api/chassis/monitor/stats` endpoint is excluded from parameter logging. The phrase "in SSR" is added for better context.

Finally, between 4:22:03 PM and 4:22:17 PM no functional changes are observed.  The commit likely focuses on minor code formatting or documentation updates.  The code remains functionally identical to the previous revision.


## 5:26:46 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go` file between 4:59:49 PM and 5:20:02 PM on July 21, 2025.  There were no changes to the code's functionality during these revisions; the changes appear to be solely related to formatting and possibly code cleanup.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go` file was updated once at 4:28:51 PM on the same day. This file defines a server for handling requests related to chassis management, including LEDs, temperatures, power, and firmware information.  It uses the `chi` router for routing requests and includes middleware for logging and request parameters. The server uses Unix domain sockets for communication and incorporates timeouts for queries and updates.  The code has numerous TODO comments indicating areas for future development, such as implementing a bandwidth limiter and more robust error handling.  The `handler.go` file contains functions for retrieving and processing data related to LEDs, temperatures, and power. There is a `phyPortMapping` which maps internal port numbers to external port numbers for LED status reporting.  The multiple revisions to `handler.go` suggest minor edits or reformatting without altering the core functionality.
