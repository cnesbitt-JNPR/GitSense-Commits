# Activity Summary for 7/21/2025

## 1:26:50 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor` directory, focusing on the `NodeMonitor.cpp` and `ChassisMonitor.cpp` files and a related test harness.

**NodeMonitor.cpp:**  The primary changes in `NodeMonitor.cpp`  occurred between 1:11:42 PM and 1:12:23 PM.  These changes involved adding a call to `pChassisMonitor->updateChassisStats()` within the `updateSecondStats()` function. This suggests an integration of chassis monitoring into the NodeMonitor's second-level statistics update.  The code consistently uses the `dolly::dynamic` library for JSON handling and data structures.  The file manages system resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk), NTP server status, and exposes several API endpoints (`/api/v1/version`, `/api/v1/platform/pciAddresses`, etc.).

**ChassisMonitor.cpp:** This file underwent extensive revision between 1:12:03 PM and 1:24:06 PM.  The initial version focused on fetching and parsing chassis temperature thresholds and temperatures from a `ChassisManager` via a Unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/chassis-manager.sock`).  Subsequent revisions added error handling for HTTP requests and improved the `handleChassisHeartbeat` function's response on non-Leopard platforms by returning appropriate HTTP error codes (`Method_Not_Allowed`).  A key change involved refactoring the `handleChassisHeartbeat` to use a helper function `resolveHeartbeatHealth` to determine the health status. The final revision moved the logging statements for  `handleChassisHeartbeat` to improve readability.  The code uses a mutex (`temperatureMutex`) to protect shared access to temperature data.  A recurring pattern is the use of helper functions for fetching, parsing, and writing data to the state.

**TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp:** The `TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp` file shows changes between 1:24:54 PM and 1:26:36 PM. This file introduces a test harness class that mocks the `ChassisManager` and state interactions for unit testing.  The main changes involve refactoring the functions to be `override` functions.  The test harness provides methods to inject dummy temperature thresholds and temperatures and to check the resulting state.


In summary, the code changes reflect the addition and refinement of chassis monitoring capabilities within the NodeMonitor application, particularly focusing on temperature monitoring and a heartbeat endpoint. The changes show a clear pattern of structured error handling, modular design using helper functions, and the use of a consistent JSON library. The test harness demonstrates a focus on thorough testing of the added functionality.


## 2:26:49 PM
The log shows modifications to code related to chassis monitoring and LED control on a Juniper Networks system.

**ChassisMonitor.hpp (7/21/2025, 1:26:54 PM):** This file defines the `ChassisMonitor` class, responsible for fetching and processing chassis temperature data and heartbeat information.  It uses `curl` for network requests, `dolly::dynamic` for JSON parsing, and interacts with a `state::Objects` object for storing system state. The class includes methods for fetching temperature thresholds and current temperatures from the chassis, parsing responses, updating state objects, and handling the heartbeat.  The move and copy constructors and assignment operators are deleted, suggesting a non-copyable/non-movable design.

**TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp (7/21/2025, 1:27:45 PM and 7/21/2025, 1:27:59 PM):** This file contains `TestHarnessChassisMonitor`, a unit testing harness for `ChassisMonitor`.  The two timestamps show a minor change:  `handleChassisHeartbeat` is renamed to `testHandleChassisHeartbeat`. The harness overrides methods in `ChassisMonitor` to simulate responses and bypass interactions with external systems (ChassisManager and State).  It provides setters for injecting dummy temperature data and thresholds for testing purposes and allows tests to check for a disconnected state and the presence of thresholds.

**ChassisMonitorTest.cpp (7/21/2025, 1:28:25 PM):** This file contains unit tests using Google Test (`gtest`) for `ChassisMonitor`.  The tests cover various scenarios including simple initialization and updates, handling disconnected states, reloading blank thresholds, managing blank temperature data, ensuring thresholds are only loaded once during initialization, and verifying temperature-based and alarm-based heartbeat behavior.  A large portion of the alarm-related test is commented out.  The test uses a test node name and initializes a `pattern::StackSafe<state::Objects>` object.  Extensive example data for temperatures and thresholds is also defined in this file.

**leopard_cpld.go (7/21/2025, 2:17:23 PM, 7/21/2025, 2:17:58 PM, 7/21/2025, 2:20:24 PM, 7/21/2025, 2:21:43 PM):** This Go file manages LED control on a Leopard system. Multiple revisions exist, with the only difference being a minor correction in a comment about the calculation for the pattern-end delay (changing from 999ms to 998ms). The file defines constants for interacting with system files in `/sys/kernel/leopard_cpld/`.  It maps various LED statuses (from an `api.LedStatus` enum) to specific color and blinking patterns using a `leopardLedWriter` struct and associated helper functions.  The code uses a switch statement to handle different LED status codes which are likely used to indicate system health or operational status.  The later revisions of this file refine the comment explaining the delay calculations.
