# Activity Summary for 7/22/2025

## 3:32:54 PM
The log shows several code changes across multiple files within a ChassisManager application.  The primary focus is on temperature monitoring and reporting, along with LED control and a heartbeat mechanism.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go` (7/22/2025, 9:40:36 AM): This file defines the main server for the ChassisManager.  It uses the `go-chi` router and handles various API requests related to LEDs and temperatures.  Significant changes include setting up routes for `/api/chassis` endpoints (leds, temperatures, power, firmware, hardware) and a `/monitor/stats` endpoint (later changed to `/monitor/temperatures`). Timeouts are configured for queries and updates (10 seconds and 5 seconds respectively). A HTTP client using a unix socket is created for communication, and a deny list is implemented to avoid excessive logging from the monitor endpoint.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/app/app.go` (7/22/2025, 9:54:32 AM - 9:55:07 AM): This file contains the main application logic for the Chassis Manager. It initializes the temperature manager, LED manager, and the server.  The `getTemperatureThresholds` function reads thresholds from an override file (`api.ThresholdOverridePath`) or uses default thresholds.  The code was updated to improve error handling and logging in `getTemperatureThresholds`, including logging the loaded temperature thresholds and clarifying error messages.  A minor edit changed a comment indicating the improvement of a code section.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/temperature.go` (7/22/2025, 10:02:50 AM - 10:21:36 AM): This file implements the temperature manager. The `Run` function periodically collects temperature data from `/sys/class/thermal` and `lm-sensors`, applies an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), and updates the runtime state.  Significant changes involved improving the `setup` function to dynamically determine thermal zone labels and writing CPU temperature thresholds to sysfs. Error handling was improved throughout the file, and a mapping of sensors to their thermal zones was added, stored in the runtime state for use by other parts of the application.  The temperature data is now stored and updated in millidegrees Celsius.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/state/state.go` (7/22/2025, 10:23:40 AM - 10:42:24 PM):  This file manages the runtime state of the Chassis Manager. It defines structs for system information and control, along with a `RuntimeState` struct holding temperature, LED, and system information.  The most significant updates add a method `GetTempsWithThresholds` to the `RuntimeState`  that returns temperature readings with corresponding thresholds from the temperature subsystem.  The `SetSensorZones` method is added to store the mapping between sensors and their corresponding zones.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/state/internals.go` (7/22/2025, 10:26:54 AM - 1:53:33 PM): This file contains internal helper functions for managing the runtime state.  The `temperature` struct now includes a `tempZones` map to store the sensor-to-zone mapping.  The `getTempsWithThresholds` function is implemented to retrieve temperatures with associated thresholds, handling potential missing thresholds gracefully.  The `setSensorZones` function was updated to correctly store the sensor zone mapping. The output format of `getTempsWithThresholds` was modified to provide `current`, `yellow`, `red`, and `shutdown` temperature values.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go` (7/22/2025, 10:42:40 PM - 1:48:32 PM): This file defines the handler for processing server requests.  It retrieves LED and temperature data from the runtime state.  The error handling is improved and the mapping from internal CPLD port numbers to silkscreen port numbers was added.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/NodeMonitor.cpp` (7/22/2025, 10:49:18 AM):  This file contains the main application logic for `NodeMonitor`, which gathers system statistics (CPU, memory, disk).  It updates the system state with this information.  This file has no updates.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.hpp` (7/22/2025, 10:49:36 AM - 1:50:08 PM): This header file declares the `ChassisMonitor` class. This class retrieves temperature data from the ChassisManager via a Unix socket and updates the system state. The significant changes involved refactoring to improve the structure and clarity of the code and updating the method used to validate the JSON returned from ChassisManager.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/ChassisMonitor.cpp` (7/22/2025, 10:51:52 PM - 1:57:58 PM):  This file implements the `ChassisMonitor` class. It fetches temperature data from the ChassisManager, and the temperature data validation function has been updated to account for the new expected JSON format.  The endpoint used for temperature retrieval was changed to `/api/chassis/monitor/temperatures`. The `validateTemperatureJson` function is improved to verify the structure and data types of the JSON. The `hasTemperatureConcerns` function was simplified by removing the `sensorTranslations` map, and it now directly compares the current and yellow threshold values.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go` (7/22/2025, 11:36:20 AM): This file implements a heartbeat monitor that periodically checks the health of SSR (via NodeMonitor).


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/TestHarnessChassisMonitor.hpp` (7/22/2025, 2:16:27 PM - 2:16:43 PM): This file provides a test harness for the `ChassisMonitor` class, simplifying testing by mocking responses.  A `fetchTemperatureThresholdsFromChassis` function was added.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/apps/NodeMonitor/test/ChassisMonitorTest.cpp` (7/22/2025, 2:22:12 PM - 2:32:01 PM): This file contains unit tests for the `ChassisMonitor` class. The tests cover various scenarios, including successful temperature updates, handling of disconnections, and the heartbeat mechanism.  The tests were updated to reflect the changes made to the `ChassisMonitor` class.  Specifically, the tests now use a simpler JSON structure and directly compare temperature and threshold values within the `hasTemperatureConcerns` tests.  The tests were simplified by removing the alarm-related tests.


In summary, the changes primarily focus on enhancing the temperature monitoring functionality, improving error handling and logging, and refining the JSON structures used for data exchange between the ChassisManager and NodeMonitor.  The changes also include improvements to the testing framework.
