# Activity Summary for 7/23/2025

## 10:32:35 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateTestLiterals.hpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateDataParserTest.cpp` on July 23, 2025.  `StateTestLiterals.hpp` underwent several revisions between 9:43 AM and 9:49 AM, primarily adding or modifying JSON string literals representing various system states (NTP server states, certificate expiration information, and chassis manager temperatures). The changes in `chassisManagerSafeTempJson`, `chassisManagerHighTempJson`, `chassisManagerCriticalTempJson` and the addition of  `chassisManagerAllCriticalTempJson` suggest an expansion of test cases covering different temperature thresholds.  The `StateDataParserTest.cpp` file was updated at 9:45 AM and again at 9:49 AM. These updates seem to reflect the additions in `StateTestLiterals.hpp`, adding test cases to the `ParseChassisManagerTemperatures` function to handle the new temperature scenarios (safe, high, critical and all critical).  The `StateDataParserTest.cpp` file also contains a TODO item indicating the need for further unit tests.

A separate file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp`, was modified at 10:29 AM. This file contains the implementation of a `StateDataParser` class, responsible for parsing various types of state data (CPU utilization, disk utilization, connections status, etc.) from JSON strings. The code shows the addition of several `parse` functions, each handling a specific data type. The `parseChassisManagerTemperatures` function is noteworthy for its inclusion of error handling when parsing JSON data and its logic to identify sensors exceeding specific temperature thresholds.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateObserverTest.cpp` file was modified twice at 10:08 AM and 10:09 AM. This file contains tests related to a `StateObserver` class, which seems to monitor state changes and invoke callbacks.  The code is extensive, defining a `TestStateObserver` class with numerous member variables, implying the monitoring of various system components and their states (Asset, Interface, Process, Platform, etc.).  The seemingly minor edits between the two timestamps suggest minor adjustments or bug fixes rather than substantial functional changes.
