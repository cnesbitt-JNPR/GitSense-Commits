# Activity Summary for 7/23/2025

## 10:32:35 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateTestLiterals.hpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateDataParserTest.cpp` on July 23, 2025.  `StateTestLiterals.hpp` underwent several revisions between 9:43 AM and 9:49 AM, primarily adding or modifying JSON string literals representing various system states (NTP server states, certificate expiration information, and chassis manager temperatures). The changes in `chassisManagerSafeTempJson`, `chassisManagerHighTempJson`, `chassisManagerCriticalTempJson` and the addition of  `chassisManagerAllCriticalTempJson` suggest an expansion of test cases covering different temperature thresholds.  The `StateDataParserTest.cpp` file was updated at 9:45 AM and again at 9:49 AM. These updates seem to reflect the additions in `StateTestLiterals.hpp`, adding test cases to the `ParseChassisManagerTemperatures` function to handle the new temperature scenarios (safe, high, critical and all critical).  The `StateDataParserTest.cpp` file also contains a TODO item indicating the need for further unit tests.

A separate file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/StateDataParser.cpp`, was modified at 10:29 AM. This file contains the implementation of a `StateDataParser` class, responsible for parsing various types of state data (CPU utilization, disk utilization, connections status, etc.) from JSON strings. The code shows the addition of several `parse` functions, each handling a specific data type. The `parseChassisManagerTemperatures` function is noteworthy for its inclusion of error handling when parsing JSON data and its logic to identify sensors exceeding specific temperature thresholds.  The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateObserverTest.cpp` file was modified twice at 10:08 AM and 10:09 AM. This file contains tests related to a `StateObserver` class, which seems to monitor state changes and invoke callbacks.  The code is extensive, defining a `TestStateObserver` class with numerous member variables, implying the monitoring of various system components and their states (Asset, Interface, Process, Platform, etc.).  The seemingly minor edits between the two timestamps suggest minor adjustments or bug fixes rather than substantial functional changes.


## 4:24:23 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of two Go files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/temperature.go`.  The `handler.go` file underwent several minor revisions between 3:43 PM and 4:14 PM with no apparent functional changes; these changes appear to be stylistic or formatting adjustments.  The final revision at 4:14 PM is identical to the revision at 4:14:39 PM.

The `temperature.go` file shows more substantial changes across several commits between 3:56 PM and 4:17 PM.  These modifications primarily involve adding debug logging statements using `log.Debugf` within the `setup` function, improving clarity on the purpose of adding sensors to regions. No major algorithmic or structural changes were introduced to the core temperature handling logic.  The timestamps indicate a period of active development and refinement, focusing on logging and potentially debugging related to sensor region mapping within the temperature management system.


## 7:24:17 PM
The provided log shows two commits to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/temperature.go`, both within a two-minute timeframe on July 23, 2025.  The changes are minor and pertain to a single function:

The first commit at 6:51:49 PM includes the initial version of the code. This version focuses on temperature monitoring, reading data from `/sys/class/thermal/` and `lm-sensors`,  applying an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) to smooth temperature readings, and writing CPU temperature thresholds to sysfs.  The code also contains several TODO comments indicating areas for future improvement, such as error handling and refactoring.

The second commit at 6:53:12 PM is a very minor change.  The only difference is in the `setup()` function.  The line `lmSensorTemps := extractTemperatureReadings(lmSensorData)` replaces `lmSensorTemps = extractTemperatureReadings(lmSensorData)`, correcting a syntax error,  where the variable was assigned without a proper declaration.  No functional change is apparent beyond this correction.  The overall functionality of temperature data collection, processing, and state updates remains the same between the two commits.
