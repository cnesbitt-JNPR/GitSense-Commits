# Activity Summary for 7/24/2025

## 10:37:34 AM
The provided log shows code changes across three files within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager` directory.  The primary focus is on temperature and LED management within a chassis manager application.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/temperature.go`**: This file underwent multiple revisions between 9:58:25 AM and 10:04:53 AM on July 24, 2025.  The changes primarily involve improvements to logging within the `setup()` function.  Specifically, the log messages related to adding sensors to regions were modified to use formatted strings with quotes around the sensor and region labels.  This change improves log readability and clarity. No functional changes appear to have been introduced.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go`**: This file contains the code for the request handler which is updated at 10:01:06 AM. This file manages various API handlers for retrieving LED and temperature data.  It includes functions to get all LEDs, system LED, port LEDs, specific port LEDs, temperatures, temperature thresholds, sensor data, and power metrics. The code shows a structure for handling requests and responses using JSON, error handling, and utilizes internal state and LED I/O functionalities. Significant portions of code are marked with `// todo` comments indicating potential future improvements or refactoring.  The `phyPortMapping` variable suggests a hardware-specific port remapping is in place.



**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go`**:  Updated at 10:31:59 AM, this file defines the main server for handling HTTP requests on a Unix domain socket. It sets up routes for various API endpoints defined in `handler.go`, including those for LEDs, temperatures, and power. The server utilizes middleware for logging, request parameter handling, and profiling. Timeout contexts are implemented for query and update operations. The code also includes a custom HTTP client and functions to handle initialization, serving, and shutdown.  The `paramLogDenyList` variable suggests an attempt to avoid excessive logging for performance-sensitive API calls such as `/api/chassis/monitor/temperatures`.
