# Activity Summary for 7/24/2025

## 10:37:34 AM
The provided log shows code changes across three files within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager` directory.  The primary focus is on temperature and LED management within a chassis manager application.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/temperature.go`**: This file underwent multiple revisions between 9:58:25 AM and 10:04:53 AM on July 24, 2025.  The changes primarily involve improvements to logging within the `setup()` function.  Specifically, the log messages related to adding sensors to regions were modified to use formatted strings with quotes around the sensor and region labels.  This change improves log readability and clarity. No functional changes appear to have been introduced.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go`**: This file contains the code for the request handler which is updated at 10:01:06 AM. This file manages various API handlers for retrieving LED and temperature data.  It includes functions to get all LEDs, system LED, port LEDs, specific port LEDs, temperatures, temperature thresholds, sensor data, and power metrics. The code shows a structure for handling requests and responses using JSON, error handling, and utilizes internal state and LED I/O functionalities. Significant portions of code are marked with `// todo` comments indicating potential future improvements or refactoring.  The `phyPortMapping` variable suggests a hardware-specific port remapping is in place.



**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go`**:  Updated at 10:31:59 AM, this file defines the main server for handling HTTP requests on a Unix domain socket. It sets up routes for various API endpoints defined in `handler.go`, including those for LEDs, temperatures, and power. The server utilizes middleware for logging, request parameter handling, and profiling. Timeout contexts are implemented for query and update operations. The code also includes a custom HTTP client and functions to handle initialization, serving, and shutdown.  The `paramLogDenyList` variable suggests an attempt to avoid excessive logging for performance-sensitive API calls such as `/api/chassis/monitor/temperatures`.


## 11:37:46 AM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go` file underwent several revisions on July 24, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on the server's routing and middleware configuration.

Initially, at 10:39:45 AM, the code included a `paramLogDenyList` to prevent excessive logging from the `/api/chassis/monitor/temperatures` endpoint and used `middleware.CommonlyUsed(middleware.DisableLogger())...` for suppressing logs,  along with  `params.RequestParamsWithDenyList(paramLogDenyList)` middleware.

At 10:39:55 AM, no significant code changes were observed in the provided diff.

A notable modification occurred at 10:43:46 AM, replacing `params.RequestParamsWithDenyList` with `params.RequestParamsContext` in `setupRoutes()`.  This suggests a shift towards a more context-based parameter handling approach.  The comment on the `monitorRouter` was also updated to better reflect its purpose.

At 10:43:56 AM, a minor clarification was added to the comment for the `monitorRouter`, emphasizing that logging is disabled because the route is frequently called.

The final change at 10:44:52 AM removed the custom logging suppression in favor of using the standard `middleware.CommonlyUsed()` function.  The comments remain the same as the previous revision.  The  `paramLogDenyList` variable was removed completely.

Finally, by 10:49:04 AM,  the `middleware.CommonlyUsed(middleware.DisableLogger())...`  was removed entirely from the `setupRoutes()` function, simplifying middleware usage to the standard `middleware.CommonlyUsed()...`.  The code now relies entirely on `params.RequestParamsContext` for request parameter handling.  This indicates a streamlining of the middleware stack and potentially a decision to manage logging elsewhere.  Throughout the various revisions, the core functionality of handling LED status, temperature readings, and other chassis information remained consistent.  The changes primarily affected the server's middleware configuration for logging and parameter handling.


## 1:37:41 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go`  between 11:51 AM and 12:02 PM on July 24, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: a server handling requests via a Unix Domain Socket, offering APIs for LEDs and temperature monitoring.

Key changes across the revisions include:

* **Route organization (11:54 AM):**  Middleware (`middleware.CommonlyUsed` and `params.RequestParamsContext`) was moved from within individual routes under `/api/chassis` to be applied to the entire `/api/chassis` route, simplifying the code.

* **Monitor route path (11:52 AM, 11:54 AM, 11:58 AM, 11:59 AM, 12:00 AM):** The path for the `/monitor` subrouter, which disables logging, changed from `/monitor` to `/api/chassis/monitor`.  This is a significant change affecting how the monitor endpoint is accessed.

* **Minor Comment Changes (11:58 AM, 11:59 AM, 12:00 AM, 12:01 AM, 12:02 AM):** Several revisions introduced minor comment edits, primarily clarifying the purpose of the `/monitor` route, emphasizing its non-logged status, and improving the clarity of comments describing the behavior of the HTTP server.

* **Function Call Consistency (12:02 PM):**  The `/api/chassis/monitor` route consistently calls `s.getTempsForMonitor()` to retrieve temperature data, instead of  `s.getTemperatures()` used in previous versions.  This implies a dedicated function for retrieving temperatures specifically for the monitor.

The code consistently uses timeouts for query and update operations, indicating a focus on robust error handling and request management.  Many functions follow a similar pattern: obtaining a context with a timeout, calling a handler function, and then returning a JSON response using `json_response.Success` or handling errors with `WriteErrorResponse`.  The code also utilizes several packages from the `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go` repository, suggesting a larger project structure.  Throughout the revisions, the overall structure and functionality of the server remain consistent, with refinements in code organization and comments.


## 2:37:36 PM
The log shows code changes across several files within a Chassis Manager application.  Significant updates occurred between 1:39 PM and 2:35 PM on July 24, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld.go`: This file defines functions to control LEDs on a Leopardv1 system.  It introduces structs (`ledColor`, `ledMode`, `ledPhy`, `leopardLedWriter`) and functions to manage LED brightness, color, and blinking patterns.  The code extensively uses a switch statement to map different LED patterns (`api.LedStatus`) to specific color and blinking configurations.  A notable feature is the use of optional functions (`ledOption`) for configuring the `leopardLedWriter`.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/app/app.go`: This file contains the main application logic. It initializes and runs the temperature manager, LED manager, and HTTP server concurrently using goroutines. The `NewApplication` function initializes the application components, including loading temperature thresholds based on the system SKU. The `Run` function manages the lifecycle of these goroutines.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/temperature.go`: This file manages temperature readings. The `Manager` struct collects temperature data from various sources (sysfs and lm-sensors), applies an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) smoothing algorithm (`updateEWMA`), and updates the application state.  The `setup` function dynamically discovers thermal zones and configures temperature thresholds in sysfs based on system configuration. Multiple changes to this file were made within a short time period, suggesting iterative development or bug fixing.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go`: This file implements a heartbeat monitor that periodically checks the health of the SSR (presumably a System-under-test) via a Unix socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock`.  The monitor handles different health states (`common.HeartbeatHealth`), logs health transitions, and implements retry logic for reconnection attempts.  Multiple revisions of this file were committed closely together, potentially indicating incremental improvements or bug fixes in the error handling and logging aspects of the heartbeat.  The code uses a `makeRequest` function which allows testability via a mocking approach.  A 5-minute grace period is incorporated during initialization, followed by a reduced grace period for subsequent reconnections.

A recurring pattern is the use of  `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/...` imports across all files, suggesting a common codebase or library.  The code consistently uses  `log.Debugf`, `log.Errorf`, `log.Infof`, and `log.Warnf` for logging, indicating a focus on logging various events.  The use of context for managing goroutines and timeouts is also consistent across all files.
