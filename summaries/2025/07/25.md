# Activity Summary for 7/25/2025

## 10:37:35 AM
The log shows multiple updates to several files within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager` directory.  The most significant changes appear between 10:06 AM and 10:32 AM.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/temperature.go`: This file underwent several revisions.  No functional changes are apparent in the provided diffs, but there are formatting differences. The code manages temperature updates, reading data from `/sys/class/thermal/` and `lm-sensors`. It uses exponentially weighted moving averages to smooth temperature readings and writes CPU temperature thresholds to sysfs files.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go`: This file, updated at 10:06:50 AM, defines an HTTP server that handles requests related to chassis management, including LEDs and temperatures.  It uses the `chi` router and various middleware components for logging, request parameters, and timeouts.  The server establishes a Unix domain socket connection for communication.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go`:  Updated at 10:07:35 AM and again at 10:32:18 AM.  This file implements a heartbeat monitor that periodically checks the health of SSR (presumably another system) via a Unix socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock`.  The health status is categorized as `Booting`, `InService`, `DegradedService`, or `OutOfService`. The later update refactors logging to improve clarity and only logs `OutOfService` health status separately.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go`: Updated at 10:26:36 AM and again at 10:31:45 AM. This file contains the request handler for the HTTP server.  It retrieves LED and temperature data from the `state` and `ledIO` components,  and handles requests related to LEDs, temperatures, and power readings.  There is a `phyPortMapping` which maps internal port numbers to external port numbers.  No functional changes are apparent in the provided diffs.


Recurring elements across the files include:  extensive use of the `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/...` package, indicating a common codebase, and a consistent pattern of error handling and logging using the `log` package.  The use of exponentially weighted moving averages is a notable algorithmic choice for smoothing temperature data.  The code also frequently handles timeouts and contexts, suggesting an emphasis on robust asynchronous operation.


## 1:37:32 PM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go` file underwent several revisions on July 25th, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: a heartbeat monitor that periodically checks the health of an SSR (presumably a Juniper Networks system) via a NodeMonitor service using a Unix socket.

The first two revisions (11:54:37 AM and 11:54:46 AM) show a minor change within the `heartbeatChecker` function. The condition for logging an error and setting the health to `common.OutOfService` changed from `consecutiveFailures >= outageThreshold` to `consecutiveFailures >= outageThreshold - 1`. This suggests a tweak to the failure threshold logic, making the system slightly more tolerant to transient failures.

The final revision (11:57:27 AM) includes a comment indicating a refactoring or documentation improvement intention related to the `heartbeatChecker` function's use of closures.  No code changes were made in this version other than this comment.  The core logic of the heartbeat monitor, encompassing health checks, request handling (using `unix.NewTransportWithStaticAddress` to communicate over a Unix socket), and error handling, remained unchanged across all revisions.  The consistent use of the `common` package and other internal Juniper-SSN packages throughout the code also indicates a cohesive internal structure.


## 2:37:35 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go` file between 2:20 PM and 2:34 PM on July 25, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout:  a heartbeat monitor that periodically checks the health of an SSR (presumably a Juniper Networks system) via a NodeMonitor service using a Unix socket connection.

The main changes across the revisions are refinements to the `heartbeatChecker` function and the introduction of named constants for outage thresholds.

Initially, `heartbeatChecker` used an `outageThreshold` parameter and an internal `consecutiveFailures` counter to determine when to mark the SSR as `OutOfService`. The logic was modified to make the `consecutiveFailures` counter start at 0 instead of 1 for better clarity.  A significant change at 2:23:05 PM moved the `ctx context.Context` parameter from the inner function to the outer, making the `ctx` parameter of the outer function.  Then at 2:25:49 PM and 2:26:20 PM, the code introduced separate constants, `initialOutageThreshold` (100) and `mainOutageThreshold` (3), to differentiate between the grace period during initialization and the normal operating grace period.  Finally, the comments were improved to better explain the grace period's purpose, clarifying that it's not retry logic but rather a mechanism to avoid immediately reporting `OutOfService` during boot or restart.  The final change at 2:34:32 PM further clarifies this intent in the comments.  Throughout the modifications, logging statements were adjusted for clarity and consistency, primarily concerning error and warning messages.  The use of `monitor.SetHealth` instead of directly assigning to `monitor.health` was also added to ensure thread safety.


## 3:37:35 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go` file between 2:47 PM and 3:02 PM on July 25, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout:  a Go program that periodically checks the health of an SSR (likely a Juniper Networks system) via a NodeMonitor service using a Unix socket connection.

The key changes are focused on the `Run` function, specifically the loops managing the heartbeat.

* **Initial versions (2:47 PM):** The initial code contained separate loops for the initial heartbeat establishment (with a longer grace period, `initialOutageThreshold = 100`) and the main heartbeat loop (shorter grace period, `mainOutageThreshold = 3`).  The `shutdown` function was a stub.

* **Minor edits (2:47 PM - 2:51 PM):** Several commits involved minor stylistic changes and adding comments clarifying the grace period logic.  The most significant change in this period was the addition of `safely` comments to the `GetHealth` and `SetHealth` functions.

* **Loop restructuring (2:56 PM):**  The `Run` function's logic was improved, using `default` in the `select` statement for both initialization and main loops.  This prevents blocking while still handling the `ctx.Done()` signal.  The variable `initialOutageThreshold` was renamed to `bootingThreshold`.

* **Final changes (2:59 PM - 3:02 PM):** The `shutdown` function was implemented to set the health to `common.OutOfService` before exiting.  The `log.Infof` call for initialization was moved before the `bootingLoop`.

Throughout all revisions, the core structure of the heartbeat check—making a GET request to `/api/v1/chassis/heartbeat` on the NodeMonitor, handling the JSON response, and appropriately setting the health status (`common.InService`, `common.DegradedService`, `common.OutOfService`)—remained unchanged. The primary focus of the updates was improving the clarity, robustness, and efficiency of the heartbeat management within the `Run` function.


## 4:37:32 PM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go` file, last modified on 7/25/2025, 4:04:47 PM, defines a heartbeat monitor for SSR (presumably a Juniper Networks system).  The code implements a `Monitor` struct that periodically checks SSR's health via a `/api/v1/chassis/heartbeat` endpoint accessed through a Unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock`).

The monitor uses two main loops: an initial "booting" loop with a 5-minute grace period (controlled by `bootingThreshold`) and a subsequent main loop.  Both loops check the SSR's health at 3-second intervals (`checkInterval`). The health status is categorized as `InService`, `DegradedService`, or `OutOfService`.  The `heartbeatChecker` function manages consecutive failures and sets the health accordingly, utilizing an outage threshold (`outageThreshold`) to determine when to mark the system as `OutOfService`. The code includes robust error handling for HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and empty responses.  It also features test-friendly functions (`NewTestHeartbeatMonitor`) allowing for mocking the HTTP request.  The code extensively uses the `common`, `requests`, `unix`, and `log` packages from the `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go` repository.
