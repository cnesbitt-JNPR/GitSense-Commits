# Activity Summary for 7/25/2025

## 10:37:35 AM
The log shows multiple updates to several files within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager` directory.  The most significant changes appear between 10:06 AM and 10:32 AM.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/temperature.go`: This file underwent several revisions.  No functional changes are apparent in the provided diffs, but there are formatting differences. The code manages temperature updates, reading data from `/sys/class/thermal/` and `lm-sensors`. It uses exponentially weighted moving averages to smooth temperature readings and writes CPU temperature thresholds to sysfs files.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go`: This file, updated at 10:06:50 AM, defines an HTTP server that handles requests related to chassis management, including LEDs and temperatures.  It uses the `chi` router and various middleware components for logging, request parameters, and timeouts.  The server establishes a Unix domain socket connection for communication.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go`:  Updated at 10:07:35 AM and again at 10:32:18 AM.  This file implements a heartbeat monitor that periodically checks the health of SSR (presumably another system) via a Unix socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock`.  The health status is categorized as `Booting`, `InService`, `DegradedService`, or `OutOfService`. The later update refactors logging to improve clarity and only logs `OutOfService` health status separately.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go`: Updated at 10:26:36 AM and again at 10:31:45 AM. This file contains the request handler for the HTTP server.  It retrieves LED and temperature data from the `state` and `ledIO` components,  and handles requests related to LEDs, temperatures, and power readings.  There is a `phyPortMapping` which maps internal port numbers to external port numbers.  No functional changes are apparent in the provided diffs.


Recurring elements across the files include:  extensive use of the `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/...` package, indicating a common codebase, and a consistent pattern of error handling and logging using the `log` package.  The use of exponentially weighted moving averages is a notable algorithmic choice for smoothing temperature data.  The code also frequently handles timeouts and contexts, suggesting an emphasis on robust asynchronous operation.
