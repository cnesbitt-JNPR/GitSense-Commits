# Activity Summary for 7/28/2025

## 10:38:37 AM
The provided log shows modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go` over a period of approximately 40 minutes on July 28, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refactoring the server's routing logic.

Initially, the code contained separate `setupPcliRoutes` and `setupMonitorRoutes` functions, each responsible for defining routes for different parts of the API.  These functions were subsequently combined into a single `setupRoutes` function.  Between 9:59:05 AM and 9:59:46 AM,  the `setupMonitorRoutes` function was significantly altered by removing redundant code, improving the comment clarity and moving the `monitorRouter` definition inside the function to avoid duplication.  

Subsequently, a series of commits between 10:13:17 AM and 10:19:47 AM further refactored the routing.  The `setupPcliRoutes` and `setupMonitorRoutes` functions were replaced with `getPcliRouter` and `getMonitorRouter`, which now return pre-configured `chi.Mux` routers. This change improves code organization and readability by separating route definition from route mounting. The `setupRoutes` function now cleanly mounts these pre-configured routers to the main router. The change between 10:16:10 AM and 10:18:17 AM was focused on making the functions receiverless and improving the comments in the `getPcliRouter` function.  The final commit at 10:19:47 AM changed the naming of the helper functions to `makePcliRouter` and `makeMonitorRouter` for clarity.

Throughout these changes, the overall structure of the HTTP handlers remained consistent, primarily using a pattern of retrieving data from a `handler` object, applying timeouts using `timeouts.QueryContext` and `timeouts.UpdateContext` , and returning JSON responses using `json_response.Success`.  The  `middleware.CommonlyUsed` function is used extensively, illustrating a pattern of consistent middleware application.  A separate monitor route with logging disabled was implemented, suggesting a performance optimization for frequently polled metrics.


The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go` was modified once at 10:32:35 AM.  This modification added a heartbeat monitor that periodically checks the health of SSR (presumably another service) and logs the status (in-service, degraded service, or out-of-service).  The monitor uses a Unix socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock` and sends a GET request to `/api/v1/chassis/heartbeat`.  The health status is updated at 3-second intervals.
