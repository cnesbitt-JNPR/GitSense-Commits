# Activity Summary for 7/28/2025

## 10:38:37 AM
The provided log shows modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/server.go` over a period of approximately 40 minutes on July 28, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refactoring the server's routing logic.

Initially, the code contained separate `setupPcliRoutes` and `setupMonitorRoutes` functions, each responsible for defining routes for different parts of the API.  These functions were subsequently combined into a single `setupRoutes` function.  Between 9:59:05 AM and 9:59:46 AM,  the `setupMonitorRoutes` function was significantly altered by removing redundant code, improving the comment clarity and moving the `monitorRouter` definition inside the function to avoid duplication.  

Subsequently, a series of commits between 10:13:17 AM and 10:19:47 AM further refactored the routing.  The `setupPcliRoutes` and `setupMonitorRoutes` functions were replaced with `getPcliRouter` and `getMonitorRouter`, which now return pre-configured `chi.Mux` routers. This change improves code organization and readability by separating route definition from route mounting. The `setupRoutes` function now cleanly mounts these pre-configured routers to the main router. The change between 10:16:10 AM and 10:18:17 AM was focused on making the functions receiverless and improving the comments in the `getPcliRouter` function.  The final commit at 10:19:47 AM changed the naming of the helper functions to `makePcliRouter` and `makeMonitorRouter` for clarity.

Throughout these changes, the overall structure of the HTTP handlers remained consistent, primarily using a pattern of retrieving data from a `handler` object, applying timeouts using `timeouts.QueryContext` and `timeouts.UpdateContext` , and returning JSON responses using `json_response.Success`.  The  `middleware.CommonlyUsed` function is used extensively, illustrating a pattern of consistent middleware application.  A separate monitor route with logging disabled was implemented, suggesting a performance optimization for frequently polled metrics.


The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go` was modified once at 10:32:35 AM.  This modification added a heartbeat monitor that periodically checks the health of SSR (presumably another service) and logs the status (in-service, degraded service, or out-of-service).  The monitor uses a Unix socket connection to `/var/run/128technology/nodeMonitor.sock` and sends a GET request to `/api/v1/chassis/heartbeat`.  The health status is updated at 3-second intervals.


## 3:39:22 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of code related to LED and temperature management within a Chassis Manager application.  Several files underwent significant changes throughout the log.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go` file was modified three times.  The most substantial changes involved initializing the `time.Timer` with `0` instead of `checkInterval` in the `Run` function (around 2:02 PM), improving the accuracy and responsiveness of the heartbeat check.  This file consistently defines a heartbeat monitor that periodically checks the SSR's health via NodeMonitor, using a unix socket connection.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_externals_mock.go` file was modified four times. Changes primarily focused on making the mock heartbeat monitor's `Run` function a complete no-op, removing the timer altogether in the final version (around 2:27 PM)  This file provides mock implementations for unit testing, simplifying the testing of the LED manager.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go` file shows the most revisions (eight times). Key changes included refactoring the timers to use `time.NewTimer` directly in the `Run` function (around 2:14 PM)  Later changes (around 3:02 PM and onward) focused on the `processRequestQueue` function, improving the handling of LED updates by aggregating updates before applying them and adding checks to prevent unnecessary updates.  The `SaveBlinkCode` function also had the blink code removal, aiming for a clearer handling of LED statuses.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/temperature.go` file saw three revisions. The most significant change involved updating the `Run` function (around 2:05 PM) to reset the timer at the beginning of each iteration to ensure consistent timing, improving the temperature update loop.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld.go` file was added at 2:27 PM. This file introduces Leopard V1-specific LED control functions, demonstrating the addition of hardware-specific support.  It defines the LED control functions, primarily using a `leopardLedWriter` struct to control the LED's brightness, color, and blinking patterns.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/common/state_file.go` file was modified three times.  Initial versions contained placeholder comments indicating TODOs. The final version (around 3:30 PM) introduced constants `senderLedStatusFile` and `senderLedStatusTmpFile`, suggesting the implementation of persistent storage for LED status.  The implementation details are still missing (marked as TODO).


The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/common/manager_externals_interface.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/manager_externals_leopard_v1.go` files were revised to align with the change in how `SaveRequestedLeds` and `LoadRequestedLeds` handle LED statuses.  This change is reflected in the  `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_externals_mock.go` file as well.  The shift happened around 3:25 PM, signifying a change in how the application stores and retrieves LED status information.


Overall, the code evolution shows a focus on improving robustness, accuracy, and maintainability, as well as adding support for new hardware.  There's also a clear effort to better manage LED statuses and implement persistent storage for recovery.  The consistent use of  `log.Infof`, `log.Warnf`, and `log.Errorf` for logging is notable.  A recurring theme is the need for chassis-specific implementations, highlighted by TODO comments.
