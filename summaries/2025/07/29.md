# Activity Summary for 7/29/2025

## 10:32:56 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of two Go files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/common/state_file.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go`.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/common/state_file.go` Changes:**

This file underwent three revisions between 9:53 AM and 9:55 AM on July 29, 2025.  The primary change was in the `LoadRequestedLedsFromFile` function. Initially, it contained commented-out code and incomplete logic. Subsequent revisions removed the commented-out code and corrected the function to correctly return the loaded `SenderLedStatuses`. The file handles saving and loading LED blink codes to and from JSON files for recovery purposes.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go` Changes:**

This file was revised four times between 10:07 AM and 10:19 AM on July 29, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on refining the `processSystemLED` and `processRequestQueue` functions.  The `processSystemLED` function's logic for handling blink codes and heartbeat health was clarified and improved for efficiency.  Specifically,  a redundant call to `manager.processRequestQueue()` was removed, and the handling of empty queues was improved. The `processRequestQueue` function now includes a clarifying comment about its return value and also improved its handling of `api.ClearStatus` updates.  These modifications aim to improve LED management by prioritizing blink codes over heartbeat health, providing better error handling, and enhancing the overall efficiency of queue processing.  There was also added a more precise comment in `processSystemLED` to highlight its logic.  The overall pattern in changes to this file is incremental refinement and optimization of the LED management logic.
