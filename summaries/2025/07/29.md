# Activity Summary for 7/29/2025

## 10:32:56 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of two Go files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/common/state_file.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go`.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/common/state_file.go` Changes:**

This file underwent three revisions between 9:53 AM and 9:55 AM on July 29, 2025.  The primary change was in the `LoadRequestedLedsFromFile` function. Initially, it contained commented-out code and incomplete logic. Subsequent revisions removed the commented-out code and corrected the function to correctly return the loaded `SenderLedStatuses`. The file handles saving and loading LED blink codes to and from JSON files for recovery purposes.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go` Changes:**

This file was revised four times between 10:07 AM and 10:19 AM on July 29, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on refining the `processSystemLED` and `processRequestQueue` functions.  The `processSystemLED` function's logic for handling blink codes and heartbeat health was clarified and improved for efficiency.  Specifically,  a redundant call to `manager.processRequestQueue()` was removed, and the handling of empty queues was improved. The `processRequestQueue` function now includes a clarifying comment about its return value and also improved its handling of `api.ClearStatus` updates.  These modifications aim to improve LED management by prioritizing blink codes over heartbeat health, providing better error handling, and enhancing the overall efficiency of queue processing.  There was also added a more precise comment in `processSystemLED` to highlight its logic.  The overall pattern in changes to this file is incremental refinement and optimization of the LED management logic.


## 11:32:58 AM
The log shows modifications to two files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/api/api.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go`.  Changes span from 10:41 AM to 10:57 AM on July 29, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/api/api.go` underwent multiple revisions.  The core change involved adding a `Priority()` method to both the `LedSender` and `LedStatus` types. This method assigns priority levels to different LED senders (SSR and MistAgent) and LED statuses (manufacturing codes, IP/DNS errors, cloud errors, config errors, firmware errors, and a catch-all), enabling conflict resolution in the LED management logic.  The initial version lacks the `Priority()` function. Subsequent versions introduce it, initially in the `LedStatus` method only, and then extend it to the `LedSender` method, making several minor edits in between.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go` was also modified.  The most substantial update occurred between 10:42 AM and 10:53 AM and involved revising the `resolveActiveBlinkCode()` function. The original implementation selected the first blink code in the `manager.senderBlinkCodes` map. The updated version uses the `Priority()` methods introduced in `api.go` to determine which blink code and sender should take precedence when multiple LEDs contend. A debug log statement showing the resolved active blink code was also added. A minor edit also occurred between 10:53 AM and 10:55 AM, adding a comment to the `resolveActiveBlinkCode()` function to highlight that it now uses the `Priority()` methods to resolve conflicts.

A new file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/common/state_file.go`, appeared at 10:57 AM. This file contains functions `SaveRequestedLedsToFile` and `LoadRequestedLedsToFile` for persisting and loading LED request states to and from the file `/var/lib/chassis-manager/requested-led-codes.json` using JSON encoding.  This suggests an improvement in the system's resilience by enabling recovery from failures.


The overall pattern reveals a systematic enhancement of the LED management system, focusing on improving the handling of multiple LED updates and adding a persistence mechanism for state recovery.  The use of logging statements throughout the code suggests a focus on debuggability and monitoring.


## 12:11:29 PM
The log shows three consecutive modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file on July 29, 2025, between 11:50:20 AM and 11:50:45 AM.  The changes are minor and involve only a single line difference between versions.  Each version defines SSH host configurations, primarily for various virtual machines (VM) indicated by names like `cnesbitt_dvm`, `cnesbitt_dvm_arm`, and versions `cnesbitt_dvm_6.1` through `cnesbitt_dvm_6.3`.  These configurations specify hostnames, user names (`centos` or `cnesbitt`), and often port numbers.  The `IdentityFile` is consistently set to `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. The only variation between the three versions is the inclusion or exclusion of `Host cnesbitt_arm_dvm` entry in the second update, which was removed in the third update.  The timestamps suggest rapid iterative changes to the configuration file.


## 1:11:29 PM
The log shows two updates to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file, both within a minute of each other (12:32 PM and 12:33 PM on July 29, 2025).  The file contains SSH configuration for multiple hosts.  The key changes are the addition of comments clarifying the purpose of different host groups ("x86 VM and containers" and "ARM VM and containers").  These comments were added in the second update.  The configuration consistently uses the `id_ed25519` key file and specifies the username as `cnesbitt`.  Several hosts point to the IP address 10.27.15.13 with varying port numbers, suggesting different virtual machine environments or services.  One host uses IP 10.27.35.27.  A host entry (`# Host cnesbitt_arm`)  was commented out in the first revision, and remained commented out in the second.


## 2:11:30 PM
The log shows two updates to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file within a minute of each other on July 29, 2025.  Both updates modify SSH configuration, defining host aliases for various virtual machines (VMs) and containers.  The first update (1:52:56 PM) lists configurations for x86 and ARM VMs,  including several  `cnesbitt_dvm` entries with varying ports (12804, 12805, 12806, 12807, 12809, 12811) and a `cnesbitt_arm` entry.  The second update (1:53:16 PM) is nearly identical but adds a new entry: `cnesbitt_arm_dev` which mirrors the port used by `cnesbitt_dvm_develop` (12809).  The recurring pattern is the use of `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` for all host entries. The key difference between the two timestamps is the addition of the `cnesbitt_arm_dev` host in the second update.


## 4:37:20 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file, all within a short time frame on July 29, 2025.  The file is an SSH configuration file defining connections to various hosts.  The key changes are related to the `cnesbitt_arm_dev` host.

The first two entries (3:43:58 PM and 3:44:50 PM) are almost identical, configuring connections to multiple hosts (including `x86` and `ARM` VMs).  The only difference is the second entry, made one minute later, changed the `HostName` of `cnesbitt_arm_dev` from `10.27.14.35` to `127.0.0.1`.

The final entry (3:49:31 PM), made five minutes after the second, is identical to the second entry, maintaining the `127.0.0.1` HostName for `cnesbitt_arm_dev`. This suggests a correction or intentional change to the configuration of the `cnesbitt_arm_dev` host.  The rest of the configuration, including the many other hosts defined, remained unchanged throughout this series of edits.  The use of `id_ed25519` as the IdentityFile for all hosts suggests a consistent approach to SSH key management.
