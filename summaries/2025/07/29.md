# Activity Summary for 7/29/2025

## 10:32:56 AM
The log shows multiple revisions of two Go files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/common/state_file.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go`.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/common/state_file.go` Changes:**

This file underwent three revisions between 9:53 AM and 9:55 AM on July 29, 2025.  The primary change was in the `LoadRequestedLedsFromFile` function. Initially, it contained commented-out code and incomplete logic. Subsequent revisions removed the commented-out code and corrected the function to correctly return the loaded `SenderLedStatuses`. The file handles saving and loading LED blink codes to and from JSON files for recovery purposes.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go` Changes:**

This file was revised four times between 10:07 AM and 10:19 AM on July 29, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on refining the `processSystemLED` and `processRequestQueue` functions.  The `processSystemLED` function's logic for handling blink codes and heartbeat health was clarified and improved for efficiency.  Specifically,  a redundant call to `manager.processRequestQueue()` was removed, and the handling of empty queues was improved. The `processRequestQueue` function now includes a clarifying comment about its return value and also improved its handling of `api.ClearStatus` updates.  These modifications aim to improve LED management by prioritizing blink codes over heartbeat health, providing better error handling, and enhancing the overall efficiency of queue processing.  There was also added a more precise comment in `processSystemLED` to highlight its logic.  The overall pattern in changes to this file is incremental refinement and optimization of the LED management logic.


## 11:32:58 AM
The log shows modifications to two files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/api/api.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go`.  Changes span from 10:41 AM to 10:57 AM on July 29, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/api/api.go` underwent multiple revisions.  The core change involved adding a `Priority()` method to both the `LedSender` and `LedStatus` types. This method assigns priority levels to different LED senders (SSR and MistAgent) and LED statuses (manufacturing codes, IP/DNS errors, cloud errors, config errors, firmware errors, and a catch-all), enabling conflict resolution in the LED management logic.  The initial version lacks the `Priority()` function. Subsequent versions introduce it, initially in the `LedStatus` method only, and then extend it to the `LedSender` method, making several minor edits in between.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go` was also modified.  The most substantial update occurred between 10:42 AM and 10:53 AM and involved revising the `resolveActiveBlinkCode()` function. The original implementation selected the first blink code in the `manager.senderBlinkCodes` map. The updated version uses the `Priority()` methods introduced in `api.go` to determine which blink code and sender should take precedence when multiple LEDs contend. A debug log statement showing the resolved active blink code was also added. A minor edit also occurred between 10:53 AM and 10:55 AM, adding a comment to the `resolveActiveBlinkCode()` function to highlight that it now uses the `Priority()` methods to resolve conflicts.

A new file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared_arm/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/common/state_file.go`, appeared at 10:57 AM. This file contains functions `SaveRequestedLedsToFile` and `LoadRequestedLedsToFile` for persisting and loading LED request states to and from the file `/var/lib/chassis-manager/requested-led-codes.json` using JSON encoding.  This suggests an improvement in the system's resilience by enabling recovery from failures.


The overall pattern reveals a systematic enhancement of the LED management system, focusing on improving the handling of multiple LED updates and adding a persistence mechanism for state recovery.  The use of logging statements throughout the code suggests a focus on debuggability and monitoring.
