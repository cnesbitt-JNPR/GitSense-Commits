# Activity Summary for 7/30/2025

## 12:39:06 PM
The log shows a single update to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file at 7/30/2025, 11:31:05 AM.  This update modifies SSH configuration entries.  The changes primarily involve adding or modifying host entries for various virtual machines (VMs) and containers,  distinguished by names like `cnesbitt_dvm`, `cnesbitt_arm`, and version numbers (e.g., `cnesbitt_dvm_6.1`).  Many entries use the same identity file (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`) and user (`cnesbitt`).  A notable pattern is the use of different port numbers for VMs likely representing various development environments or features.  Some entries, specifically those related to `cnesbitt_arm_feat` and `cnesbitt_arm_dev`, use `ProxyJump` to connect through another host (`cnesbitt_arm`).  The configurations appear to manage connections to both x86 and ARM-based VMs and containers.
