# Activity Summary for 7/31/2025

## 3:37:23 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` and a single update to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file was modified three times on July 30, 2025.  The first modification (3:25:01 PM) contained a comprehensive list of SSH configurations for various hosts, including x86 and ARM VMs and containers.  These configurations specified HostName, User, IdentityFile, and ProxyJump settings for multiple development and feature branches.  The second modification (5:00:15 PM) removed the `ProxyJump` directives from several entries, simplifying the configurations.  The final modification (5:02:01 PM) further altered the configurations by changing the `HostName` values for several entries from `127.0.0.1` to `10.27.15.13`, indicating a shift in the target machines.  A recurring pattern is the consistent use of `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` and the user `cnesbitt` across most entries.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file was updated once at 5:02:22 PM. This update added or updated several host entries, including various IP addresses and their corresponding SSH keys (ed25519, rsa, and ecdsa-sha2-nistp256). The file contains public keys for many different hosts, suggesting that they were added as part of a larger infrastructure or deployment update.  Several IP addresses appear multiple times with different port numbers and key types. There is also a notable entry for `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` which includes three different key types.

The code changes log reflects development on a Chassis Manager for LED control, primarily focusing on  `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/` directory.  The updates span approximately an hour on July 31st, 2025.

The `common.go` file (multiple revisions between 9:47 AM and 9:48 AM) defines data structures for LED patterns (`LedPattern`, `PhyStatus`),  heartbeat health (`HeartbeatHealth`), and  API blink codes (`ApiBlinkCodes`/`APIBlinkCodes`).  A minor typo (`APIBlinkCodes` corrected to `APIBlinkCodes`) was fixed within this timeframe.  The `Pattern()` and `String()` methods for `HeartbeatHealth` were added, providing string representations for different health states.


The `manager_externals_interface.go` file (9:48:19 AM) introduces the `ManagerExternalsInterface`, an interface for abstracting hardware-specific LED control.

The `state_file.go` file undergoes several revisions (9:48:27 AM, 9:48:45 AM, 9:49:33 AM, 9:50:18 AM).  These revisions involve changes to file paths for persistent storage of LED status (`senderLedStatusFile` initially, then changed to `apiBlinkCodeFile`).  The code implements functions to save (`SaveRequestedLedsToFile`) and load (`LoadRequestedLedsFromFile`) LED configurations from JSON files, using temporary files to ensure atomicity.


The `manager_externals_mock.go` file (9:51:27 AM and 9:52:10 AM) provides mock implementations of `ManagerExternalsInterface` and `HeartbeatInterface` for testing purposes. A small change in the 9:52:10 AM revision involved correcting a variable name from `senderLeds` to `codes` in the `SaveRequestedLeds` function.


The `manager.go` file is significantly updated (multiple revisions between 9:53:58 AM and 9:59:12 AM). It implements the `Manager` struct, which coordinates LED control based on heartbeat health and requests from different sources.  The  `Manager` uses a request queue (`serverIO.RequestQueue`) to process LED updates and employs a priority system to resolve conflicts.  The main function, `Run`, launches goroutines for the heartbeat monitor and LED updates, managing timers for system and physical LEDs.  A notable change between the last two revisions is the renaming of `LoadAPIBlinkCodes` and `SaveAPIBlinkCodes` in the `Manager` struct, with the changes consistent throughout the file.


The `leopardv1/manager_externals_leopard_v1.go` file (9:57:54 AM) provides a Leopard V1-specific implementation of the `ManagerExternalsInterface`, showing how hardware-specific functionality can be integrated.

Overall, the changes show a structured approach to LED management, emphasizing modularity (interfaces), testability (mocks), and robustness (state persistence and error handling). The consistent use of temporary files and atomic operations for file I/O demonstrates a focus on data integrity.  The updates reflect an iterative development process, with minor bug fixes and refactoring alongside major feature additions.
