# Activity Summary for 7/31/2025

## 3:37:23 AM
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` and a single update to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file was modified three times on July 30, 2025.  The first modification (3:25:01 PM) contained a comprehensive list of SSH configurations for various hosts, including x86 and ARM VMs and containers.  These configurations specified HostName, User, IdentityFile, and ProxyJump settings for multiple development and feature branches.  The second modification (5:00:15 PM) removed the `ProxyJump` directives from several entries, simplifying the configurations.  The final modification (5:02:01 PM) further altered the configurations by changing the `HostName` values for several entries from `127.0.0.1` to `10.27.15.13`, indicating a shift in the target machines.  A recurring pattern is the consistent use of `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` and the user `cnesbitt` across most entries.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file was updated once at 5:02:22 PM. This update added or updated several host entries, including various IP addresses and their corresponding SSH keys (ed25519, rsa, and ecdsa-sha2-nistp256). The file contains public keys for many different hosts, suggesting that they were added as part of a larger infrastructure or deployment update.  Several IP addresses appear multiple times with different port numbers and key types. There is also a notable entry for `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` which includes three different key types.
