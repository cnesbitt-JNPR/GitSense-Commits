# Activity Summary for 8/1/2025

## 3:14:56 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to test files (`StateMonitorTest.hpp`, `StateMonitorTest.cpp`, `AlarmTest.cpp`) within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/test` directory.  All changes occurred on August 1st, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/test/StateMonitorTest.hpp`: This header file underwent two revisions.  The primary change between the first and second revision, and then the second and third revision, was the renaming of the `healthHasAlarms()` function to `healthCheckHasAlarms()`. No other significant changes are apparent in the header file.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/test/StateMonitorTest.cpp`: This source file also had two revisions.  The changes are focused on the implementation details of the test functions, including modifications to configuration loading (`loadConfigWith...` functions), and no significant structural changes are observed. One noticeable change is the addition of debug logging using `DebugLog(TEST)`.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/test/AlarmTest.cpp`: This file also shows two revisions with identical content.  The code defines various helper functions for setting and checking alarm states within a testing framework.  These functions extensively use `EXPECT_BECOMES_TRUE`, `EXPECT_BECOMES_FALSE`, and `EXPECT_BECOMES_EQ`  macros, suggesting a pattern of verifying alarm states throughout the testing process. The functions cover interface alarms (admin, oper, provisional status), platform alarms, security key alarms, and system alarms (disk and memory utilization), as well as connectivity alarms.


In summary, the changes primarily involve minor refactoring of function names (`healthHasAlarms` to `healthCheckHasAlarms`), extensive unit test additions or modifications in `AlarmTest.cpp` and minor additions to the StateMonitorTest code. The time stamps show that the changes happened within a short time frame (minutes apart).  The consistent use of the `dolly` library and Google Test framework is a recurring element throughout the code.


## 4:14:53 PM
The log shows three revisions of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/test/AlarmTest.cpp`, all within a short time frame on August 1st, 2025.  The code appears to be a C++ unit test for an alarm management system.  No changes were made to the code across the three revisions; the file content is identical in each revision.  The timestamps indicate that the file was potentially saved or checked in multiple times without any actual code modification.  The test extensively uses the `AlarmManager` class to verify the generation and clearing of alarms related to network interfaces (admin, operational, and provisional status), platform components (flow meter, FIB meter, etc.), security keys, system resources (disk and memory utilization), and connectivity.  The tests utilize helper functions like `setInterfaceAlarmDynamicData` and `clearInterfaceAlarmDynamicData` to manage test state.  The `EXPECT_BECOMES_TRUE` and `EXPECT_BECOMES_FALSE` assertions suggest the use of a testing framework that tracks state changes.
