# Activity Summary for 8/5/2025

## 5:10:36 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of a Go program (`heartbeat.go`) that implements a heartbeat monitor and a C++ program (`StateMonitor.cpp`) that appears to be a state monitoring service.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat.go`**:  This file underwent three revisions between 4:10:55 PM and 4:13:50 PM on August 5th, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent:  periodically checking the health of an SSR (likely a Juniper Networks system) via a StateMonitor service using a unix socket connection.  The key changes were:

* **4:10:55 PM:** Initial version.  The `ssrHealth` constants were defined with `ssrHealthy` and `ssrMajorOrCriticalAlarm` both having a value of 0, resulting in potential ambiguity.
* **4:11:12 PM:** A minor correction in the `handleHeartbeatResponse` function; the constant `ssrHealthy` was correctly assigned the value 0, and `ssrMajorOrCriticalAlarm` was assigned value 1. This corrects the ambiguity in the previous version
* **4:11:24 PM:** The `ssrHealth` constants were further refined, giving `ssrHealthy` a value of 1 and `ssrMajorOrCriticalAlarm` a value of 2, improving clarity and removing potential ambiguity.
* **4:13:50 PM:** The `fetchSsrHealth` function was renamed to `fetchSSRHealth`. This is a minor renaming change.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/StateMonitor.cpp`**: This file contains a single revision at 4:12:46 PM on August 5th, 2025. It is a substantial C++ application responsible for monitoring the system state, managing alarms, and providing a REST API.  The code showcases features like:

* Extensive alarm management capabilities, including extensible alarms and handling of various alarm sources.
* Interactions with a ZooKeeper-like service for node and state updates (indicated by the use of `zk::ConnectionState`).
* Handling of configuration changes, including parsing XML configuration data.
* REST API endpoints for retrieving alarms, system information, and managing extensible alarms.  Importantly,  a `/api/v1/ssr/health` endpoint is specifically noted as *not* being exposed to the public API, suggesting it's intended for internal use by components like the Go `heartbeat` program.

The overall pattern observed is a distributed system architecture where the Go program acts as a client, periodically querying the C++ StateMonitor service for health information.  The C++ service maintains a comprehensive system state and alarm management system. The modifications to the Go code were iterative refinements focused on improving the clarity and accuracy of the health status reporting.
