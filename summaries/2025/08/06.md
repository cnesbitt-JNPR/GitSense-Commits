# Activity Summary for 8/6/2025

## 11:15:39 AM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file was updated twice within a short time frame (8/6/2025, 10:32:15 AM and 8/6/2025, 10:32:25 AM), but the content remained identical in both logs.  The file contains host key information for various IP addresses (e.g., 10.27.15.13, 10.27.36.239) and hostnames (e.g., launchpad.ssn.juniper.net), utilizing ssh-ed25519, ssh-rsa, and ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 key types.  Many entries are for the same IP address but different ports.


The `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file was updated once at 8/6/2025, 10:35:55 AM.  This file configures SSH connections, defining host aliases (e.g., `cnesbitt_dvm`, `cnesbitt_arm`) with corresponding hostnames, usernames (primarily `centos` or `cnesbitt`), IdentityFiles (all pointing to `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`), and some entries specifying ports and `ProxyJump` configurations. The configuration seems to manage connections to both x86 and ARM virtual machines and containers.  There's a pattern of multiple entries for `cnesbitt_dvm` with different ports, likely representing different environments (feat, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, develop, el9), and similar for `cnesbitt_arm` (feat, dev).


## 2:15:03 PM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/config` file was updated on August 6th, 2025, at 1:27:20 PM.  This update appears to configure SSH access to multiple virtual machines (VMs) and containers.  The configuration includes entries for both x86 and ARM VMs.  A notable pattern is the use of `ProxyJump` for several hosts, indicating that connections are routed through another host (`cnesbitt_dvm` or `cnesbitt_arm`).  The x86 VMs are accessed directly by IP address (e.g., `10.27.35.27`), whereas the others use localhost (`127.0.0.1`) and varying port numbers (12801-12810), suggesting these are likely local development environments accessed via port forwarding.  All entries use the same user (`cnesbitt`) and identity file (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).  The naming convention suggests different development environments (e.g., `_feat`, `_dev`, version numbers like `6.1`, `6.2`, `6.3`).
