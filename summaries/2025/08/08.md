# Activity Summary for 8/8/2025

## 3:52:59 PM
The provided log shows three revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/server/handler.go` file, all within a short time frame (approximately 2 minutes) on August 8th, 2025.  The code itself remains largely unchanged across these revisions.  The file contains a `Handler` struct and associated methods for managing LEDs and temperature sensors.  There are functions to retrieve LED status (system and port LEDs), update system LED status, and retrieve various temperature readings and power metrics.  The code uses several custom types from the `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager` package (e.g., `ledcommon`, `state`, `types`).

Recurring elements include the use of `map[string]any` for data structures, numerous TODO comments suggesting areas for future improvements (e.g., better error handling, more robust validation, chassis-specific implementations), and error handling that returns descriptive error messages.  The `phyPortMapping` variable defines a mapping between internal and external port numbers. No functional changes were observed in the three revisions.
