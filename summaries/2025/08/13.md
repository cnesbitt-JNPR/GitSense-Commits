# Activity Summary for 8/13/2025

## 2:27:35 PM
The code changes log details the development of a LED management system, specifically focusing on unit testing and the Leopard V1 hardware implementation.

On August 13th, 2025, the `phy_handler_interface.go` file was updated at 1:27:03 PM to define an interface, `PhyHandlerInterface`, with methods for updating and clearing physical LED status.  This suggests a separation of concerns between LED management logic and hardware-specific implementations.

The majority of changes center around `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_internal_test.go`, with multiple revisions between 1:28:42 PM and 1:58:22 PM. These revisions consist of extensive unit tests covering various aspects of the LED manager:

* **LED Pattern Handling:**  Tests verify the correct setting and propagation of LED patterns (e.g., `patternNoIPAddr`, `patternManufacturingSuccess`, `patternInService`) to both external systems and internal components (`externals`, `serverIO`, `manager`).  These patterns represent different system states, indicated by blink codes or solid LED colors.

* **Heartbeat Integration:**  Tests ensure the LED manager correctly reflects the system's health status received from a heartbeat monitor, using patterns like `OutOfService` and `InService`.  It handles scenarios where external systems are out of sync with the manager's internal state.

* **Blink Code Resolution:** Tests focus on the prioritization of different blink codes from various sources (`api.SSR`, `api.MistAgent`), ensuring the LED manager correctly selects the highest priority code.

* **Request Queue Processing:** Tests verify the processing of LED update requests from a queue, including handling redundant updates, unknown senders, and unknown status codes. It tests clearing of codes and simultaneous set and clear operations for single senders.  There is a progressive refinement in these tests, enhancing their coverage and handling of edge cases. The `addToQueue` helper function is repeatedly improved, eventually including `t.Helper()`.

* **Shutdown Behavior:** Tests confirm the correct reset of LEDs during system shutdown, and also that pending queue requests are processed.

* **Initial System LED Resolution:** Tests verify how the initial system LED state is determined, prioritizing saved blink codes from persistent storage over heartbeat status.

* **Run Method Testing:**  The final additions introduce a `TestRun` function, implying asynchronous functionality and testing concurrent updates and shutdown.  The test involves starting the manager in a goroutine and verifying LED behavior over time.

A new file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/manager_externals_leopard_v1.go`, appeared at 2:06:07 PM, implementing Leopard V1-specific LED control functions for setting system and physical LEDs, along with duration handling and blink code persistence.  This file is clearly the hardware-specific implementation for the `common.ManagerExternalsInterface`.

The overall pattern shows a systematic approach to unit testing with a focus on thoroughly testing various scenarios for LED pattern changes, handling of heartbeat and blink codes, and managing a request queue for updates. The final version of `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_internal_test.go` introduces a `makeManagerObjects` helper function to streamline test setup.
