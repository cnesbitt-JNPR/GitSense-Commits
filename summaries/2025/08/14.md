# Activity Summary for 8/14/2025

## 5:26:58 PM
The log shows multiple revisions to two Go files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/file/state_file.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld.go`.  Changes primarily involve error handling and code style improvements, with a minor addition in `leopard_cpld.go`.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/file/state_file.go`: This file underwent several minor revisions between 4:38 PM and 4:44 PM on August 14, 2025.  The core functionality remained unchanged; it manages saving and loading API blink codes to and from a JSON file (`api-led-codes.json`).  The modifications primarily focused on refining error handling within the `cleanupTemporaryFile` function, specifically addressing how errors from file removal are handled using `//nolint:errorlint` and `//nolint:errcheck` annotations in different revisions, and a clarifying comment was added to the `StateFileWriter` type declaration.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld.go`:  This file was updated between 4:45 PM and 4:47 PM on August 14, 2025. The main change involved adding handling for `api.UnknownStatus` and `api.ClearStatus` in the `setLeopardSystemLEDFromBlinkCode` function. These statuses now set the `config` variable to `nil`, implying no LED action is taken for these cases.  The rest of the file remained largely consistent, defining constants for interacting with Leopard CPLD LED controls and implementing functions to manage system and PHY LEDs based on status and speed.  The code uses a switch statement to map `api.LEDStatus` values to specific LED configurations.
