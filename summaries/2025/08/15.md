# Activity Summary for 8/15/2025

## 4:26:55 PM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld_internal_test.go` file underwent several revisions on August 15th, 2025, primarily focusing on improving the `TestSystemLED` function.  The initial versions used nested loops and multi-dimensional arrays to represent LED configurations for health and blink codes. These were progressively refactored to use more structured data types, `healthCPLD` and then `cpldTest`, improving code readability and maintainability.

The first significant change (3:47:01 PM) introduced the `TestSystemLED` function with a less organized data structure. The second change (3:47:31 PM) removed a `//nolint:stylecheck` comment, suggesting a minor style adjustment.  Further modifications (3:52:51 PM, 4:10:49 PM, 4:13:05 PM, 4:14:11 PM, 4:18:16 PM, 4:19:09 PM and 4:22:43 PM) focused on replacing the initial data structures with custom structs (`healthCPLD` and eventually `cpldTest`), resulting in clearer code organization.  The `getAllHealthCPLDCodes` and `getAllBlinkCodeCPLDs` functions were added to generate these structured data, further enhancing code organization. The final version (4:24:00 PM) introduced iterating over maps in `TestSystemLED` instead of arrays, making the code more efficient and readable by directly associating LED configurations with their corresponding health or blink codes. The changes consistently involved improvements to how LED color, control signals, off periods, blink rates, and modes were handled and represented. Throughout the process, the core logic for testing LED patterns and durations remained unchanged.

The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld_internal_test.go` file between 4:27 PM and 4:30 PM on August 15th, 2025.  The file contains unit tests for LED functionality related to a "Leopard" system.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions, focusing on testing LED pattern durations and associated CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device) configurations.

The primary changes between revisions involve the `getAllBlinkCodeCPLDs()` function.  Initially, this function lacked explicit constants for `offPeriod` and `blinkRate`. In subsequent revisions, constants `noOffPeriod` (0) and `offPeriod` (1) were introduced for better code clarity, and `blinkRate` was consistently set to 1.  This suggests a refinement in the test data structure for representing CPLD configurations.  No functional changes to the core test logic are apparent in the provided diffs; only improvements in code style and constants were made.
