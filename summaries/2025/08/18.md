# Activity Summary for 8/18/2025

## 9:26:52 AM
The provided log shows three revisions of the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld_internal_test.go`, all on August 18th, 2025.  The code is a Go unit test file for LED pattern durations and CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device) file generation for a Leopard system.

No changes were made to the code across the three revisions.  All three revisions contain the same code, focused on testing LED patterns for different system health statuses and error conditions. The tests calculate expected LED durations based on pattern types (solid, alternating blink, repeating blink, two-phase blink) and compare them to actual durations from a simulated CPLD writer.  The code also checks the generated CPLD files for correctness against expected configurations for various health and blink codes, using a mock filesystem.  The `getAllHealthCodeCPLDs` and `getAllBlinkCodeCPLDs` functions define the mappings between health/blink codes and their corresponding CPLD configurations (colors, control signals, blink rates).  The timestamps indicate that the file was likely committed multiple times without any code modifications. The time difference between commits is small, suggesting a potential workflow issue or a testing/debugging process.
