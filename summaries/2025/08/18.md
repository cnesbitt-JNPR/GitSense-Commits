# Activity Summary for 8/18/2025

## 9:26:52 AM
The provided log shows three revisions of the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld_internal_test.go`, all on August 18th, 2025.  The code is a Go unit test file for LED pattern durations and CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device) file generation for a Leopard system.

No changes were made to the code across the three revisions.  All three revisions contain the same code, focused on testing LED patterns for different system health statuses and error conditions. The tests calculate expected LED durations based on pattern types (solid, alternating blink, repeating blink, two-phase blink) and compare them to actual durations from a simulated CPLD writer.  The code also checks the generated CPLD files for correctness against expected configurations for various health and blink codes, using a mock filesystem.  The `getAllHealthCodeCPLDs` and `getAllBlinkCodeCPLDs` functions define the mappings between health/blink codes and their corresponding CPLD configurations (colors, control signals, blink rates).  The timestamps indicate that the file was likely committed multiple times without any code modifications. The time difference between commits is small, suggesting a potential workflow issue or a testing/debugging process.

The log shows two commits to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld_internal_test.go`, both on August 18, 2025.  The commits appear to be nearly identical, with only minor, possibly insignificant, differences.  The file contains Go unit tests for LED pattern durations and CPLD file generation for a Leopard CPLD writer.

The `TestPatternDurations` function verifies LED pattern durations by comparing calculated durations with those returned by the CPLD writer for various health codes (`common.HeartbeatHealth`) and blink codes (`api.LEDStatus`).  The code includes functions to calculate durations based on different blinking patterns (solid, alternating, repeating, two-phase).

The `TestSystemLEDs` function checks the generated CPLD files against expected values for both health and blink codes.  These expected values are defined in `getExpectedHealthCodeCPLDs` and `getExpectedBlinkCodeCPLDs`, which map codes to  `cpldTest` structs defining LED color, control signals, off periods, blink rates, and modes.  The second commit shows no apparent changes to the logic or content of the code within these functions.  The timestamps show the commits occurred within one minute of each other.
