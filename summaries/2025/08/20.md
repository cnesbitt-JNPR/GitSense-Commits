# Activity Summary for 8/20/2025

## 11:26:52 AM
The log shows two entries for the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat_internal_test.go`, both at 8/20/2025, with a difference of 8 seconds between them.  The content of the file is identical in both entries, suggesting a possible duplicate log entry or a failed attempt to modify the file that resulted in no actual code change.  The code itself is a Go test file for a heartbeat monitor.  It includes tests for various scenarios such as shutdown, health application (with different health states like `Booting`, `InService`, `OutOfService`, `DegradedService`), fetching SSR health (simulating various HTTP responses), and monitoring run with different response scenarios and timeouts. The tests heavily utilize the `assert` and `require` functions from the `stretchr/testify` library.  There is no substantive difference between the two logged versions of the file.
