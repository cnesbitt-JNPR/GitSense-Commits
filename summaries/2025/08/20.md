# Activity Summary for 8/20/2025

## 11:26:52 AM
The log shows two entries for the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat_internal_test.go`, both at 8/20/2025, with a difference of 8 seconds between them.  The content of the file is identical in both entries, suggesting a possible duplicate log entry or a failed attempt to modify the file that resulted in no actual code change.  The code itself is a Go test file for a heartbeat monitor.  It includes tests for various scenarios such as shutdown, health application (with different health states like `Booting`, `InService`, `OutOfService`, `DegradedService`), fetching SSR health (simulating various HTTP responses), and monitoring run with different response scenarios and timeouts. The tests heavily utilize the `assert` and `require` functions from the `stretchr/testify` library.  There is no substantive difference between the two logged versions of the file.

The log shows two Go test files related to a ChassisManager application.  Both files utilize the `stretchr/testify` assertion library.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/file/state_file_test.go` (8/20/2025, 11:32:28 AM) contains tests for a state file writer (`file.NewTestStateFileWriter`).  These tests verify the saving and loading of API blink codes to and from a file, including handling cases with empty data and file existence checks.  The file uses the `common` and `api` packages within the `Juniper-SSN/ssr` project.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/heartbeat_internal_test.go` (8/20/2025, 11:43:19 AM) includes comprehensive tests for a heartbeat monitor.  It uses a `dummyHeartbeatResponse` struct to simulate HTTP responses with various status codes and health states (e.g., `SSRHealthy`, `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm`, `SSRUnknownHealth`).  Tests cover scenarios such as shutdown behavior, health updates with reasons, and the handling of various response types from the StateMonitor including errors, empty bodies, and unparsable JSON. The tests extensively use `assert.Eventually` and `assert.Never` functions to verify that the system transitions to the correct health states within expected time windows.  It also checks initialization, fetching health data, and shutdown procedures within the `Run` method.  Several test functions cover different scenarios of responses from the StateMonitor.
