# Activity Summary for 8/21/2025

## 3:39:17 PM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld_internal_test.go` on August 21, 2025.  The file contains unit tests for LED functionality.  Key changes occurred between 3:13:19 PM and 3:15:44 PM.

The primary change involves the `getExpectedBlinkCodeCPLDs()` function.  Initially, the `offPeriod` constant within this function was consistently set to `disabled` (0).  This was modified in a subsequent commit to use `enabled` (1) for several `api.LEDStatus` codes related to cloud connectivity issues and boot configuration problems.  This suggests an update to how these specific LED blink patterns are handled, possibly to better distinguish them visually or for improved diagnostics.  The code remains largely unchanged otherwise, focused on testing LED durations and patterns based on different health and blink codes. The tests cover comprehensive LED status scenarios, including health statuses and various error conditions.  The test functions use helper functions to calculate expected LED durations and check the resulting CPLD files against expected values within a mock filesystem.

The log shows multiple revisions of two Go files: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/temperature.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/types/types.go`.  The changes span approximately 30 minutes on August 21, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/temperature.go` underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on refinements to the `checkForCriticalShutdown` function.  Specifically, the formatting of the log message within `checkForCriticalShutdown` changed to display temperature values in degrees (using a `toDegrees` function, assumed to exist elsewhere). No other substantial changes are present across the revisions of this file, aside from minor formatting and no changes in functionality.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/types/types.go` also saw multiple revisions, all within a short timeframe. The core changes were within the `ThresholdDesignator` function's error handling for the `DefaultSensorType`.  The error message was made more explicit and consistent in its wording across different revisions.


The overall pattern observed suggests iterative debugging and minor code cleanup rather than major functional changes.  The majority of the modifications appear to be focused on improving error handling and log message clarity.
