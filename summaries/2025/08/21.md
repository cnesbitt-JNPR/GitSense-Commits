# Activity Summary for 8/21/2025

## 3:39:17 PM
The log shows modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/leopardv1/leopard_cpld_internal_test.go` on August 21, 2025.  The file contains unit tests for LED functionality.  Key changes occurred between 3:13:19 PM and 3:15:44 PM.

The primary change involves the `getExpectedBlinkCodeCPLDs()` function.  Initially, the `offPeriod` constant within this function was consistently set to `disabled` (0).  This was modified in a subsequent commit to use `enabled` (1) for several `api.LEDStatus` codes related to cloud connectivity issues and boot configuration problems.  This suggests an update to how these specific LED blink patterns are handled, possibly to better distinguish them visually or for improved diagnostics.  The code remains largely unchanged otherwise, focused on testing LED durations and patterns based on different health and blink codes. The tests cover comprehensive LED status scenarios, including health statuses and various error conditions.  The test functions use helper functions to calculate expected LED durations and check the resulting CPLD files against expected values within a mock filesystem.
