# Activity Summary for 8/26/2025

## 5:28:06 PM
The log shows extensive modifications to the LED management system within a Chassis Manager, primarily focusing on the Leopard platform.  The changes span several files and primarily concentrate on LED control and status updates between 4:28 PM and 4:43 PM on August 26, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/common/mock_led_externals.go`: This file underwent multiple revisions, primarily refactoring the `MockLEDExternals` struct and its associated methods to better implement the `Externals` interface. The name was changed from `MockLEDExternals` to `MockExternals` in one of the revisions.  The core functionality of mocking LED interactions remained consistent.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/phy/handler.go`: This file details the `Handler` responsible for fetching and updating PHY port LED statuses.  Significant changes involve updating the `NewHandler` function to initialize `lastPhyStates` more robustly and altering the `processPhyLEDStatus` function for improved clarity. A notable change is the updated `NewHandler` function's signature, changing the `externals` parameter type from `common.LEDExternals` to `common.Externals`. This change reflects the refactoring in `mock_led_externals.go`.  A later revision simplifies the for loop in `NewHandler`.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/platform/leopard/led/led_externals.go`: This file contains the Leopard-specific LED external implementation.  Updates are minor, primarily involving changing the receiver type in `GetCPSSPortMap` and `GetSilkscreenPortMap` from `(ext *Externals)` to `(*Externals)`.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/common/led_externals.go`: This file defines the `Externals` interface, which appears to be a central component of the LED management system refactoring. No code changes were made to this file during the period.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager_factory.go`: This file contains the factory for creating the LED manager.  The main changes are in improving consistency in variable naming (e.g., changing `components` to `c`). The logic for selecting real vs mock components based on the SKU remains the same.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/platform/leopard/led/phy.go`: This file manages the mapping between internal and external port indices for the Leopard platform. It contains several TODO comments indicating planned refactorings and improvements to the port mapping system. No code changes made to this file during the period.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/manager.go`: This file contains the main LED manager logic. The code remains largely unchanged during the recorded period; only minor formatting changes occurred in the comments.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/platform/leopard/led/cpld.go`: This file contains the Leopard CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device) interaction logic.  The main change is a significant expansion of the `setLeopardSystemLEDFromBlinkCode` function, adding detailed handling for various LED status codes. The switch statement in this function was extended considerably.  The latter revisions to this file contained no further changes.

The recurring theme throughout these changes is a refactoring effort to improve the architecture of the LED management system.  The introduction and consistent use of the `Externals` interface suggests a move towards greater modularity and flexibility in supporting different chassis types.  The modifications to the `manager_factory.go` file show a strategy to swap out implementation details (real vs mock components) depending on the system SKU.  The extended `setLeopardSystemLEDFromBlinkCode` function indicates enhanced support for different blink codes and corresponding LED patterns.
