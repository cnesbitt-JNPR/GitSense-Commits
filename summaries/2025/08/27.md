# Activity Summary for 8/27/2025

## 2:06:36 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/state/led` directory, focusing on the `led.go` and `state.go` files.  The changes primarily involve the implementation of LED state management within a Chassis Manager application.

The initial commit at 1:07:08 PM on August 27, 2025, introduced `state.go`, defining a `State` struct and methods for accessing and manipulating LED states (system LED and PHY states).  These methods appear to be thread-safe, utilizing an underlying `ledData` struct.

Subsequent commits between 1:13:42 PM and 1:19:56 PM, all modifying `led.go`, progressively enhanced the `ledData` struct.  Initially, it contained a request queue, system LED state, and PHY states.  The most significant changes involved adding `cpldToSilkScreenPortMapping` and `SilkScreenToCPLDPortMapping` maps, and importantly, the `setSilkscreenPortMap` function to manage bidirectional mapping between silkscreen and CPLD port indices. This suggests handling port mapping between different representations. Also, the `getInternalPortIndex` and `getExternalPortIndex` functions were added, providing error handling for invalid port indices, further solidifying port index management.  This part of the development happened in a rapid succession between 1:13:42 PM and 1:15:51 PM.

Finally, a modification to `state.go` at 1:17:00 PM and 1:17:06 PM introduced `ErrInvalidPortIndex`, a custom error type to handle invalid port index errors, and the subsequent commit changed it to `var ErrInvalidPortIndex`, making it a global variable, showing a slight refactoring of the error management.  A final change at 1:17:31 PM added thread safety to the `getInternalPortIndex` function in `led.go` using `ledMu.Lock()` and `ledMu.Unlock()`.


The overall pattern reveals a focus on building a robust and thread-safe system for managing LED states, particularly emphasizing efficient and error-handled port index mappings.  The concentrated modifications to `led.go` between 1:13 PM and 1:16 PM show intensive work on the port mapping functionality.
