# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 11:18:00 AM
The log shows several code changes related to Chassis Manager, focusing on temperature threshold management.  The main changes occurred between 11:08 AM and 11:17 AM on August 28, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/main.go` (11:08:40 AM): This file is the main application entry point.  It initializes logging, retrieves system and control information (including architecture, version, and SKU-based capabilities, particularly focusing on whether the system is a "Leopard" model), creates an application instance, and runs the Chassis Manager application.  Error handling and graceful shutdown are implemented using context.Context and signals.  The code extensively uses `exec.Command` to interact with the system for information retrieval.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/thresholds/defaults.go` (Multiple timestamps): This file defines an interface `DefaultThresholds` and a mock implementation `MockDefaultThresholds`.  Minor edits refined comments and function descriptions between 11:09 AM and 11:10 AM, with no functional changes.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/platform/leopard/temperature/defaults.go` (Multiple timestamps): This file contains the main implementation of `DefaultThresholds` for Leopard platforms. It defines a `DefaultThresholds` struct containing a map of SKUs to temperature thresholds for different hardware regions ("mainboard," "cpu," "mac").  The `resolveSKU` function attempts to map the input SKU to a known SKU family or base SKU from the `platform` package.  Changes between 11:11 AM and 11:17 AM involved refining comments and improving the `resolveSKU` function to log a warning instead of an error if no matching SKU is found and to return the original SKU in such cases.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/manager_factory.go` (11:13:30 AM): This file contains the `NewTemperatureManager` function, which creates a temperature manager based on the runtime state and uses `platformTemps.NewDefaultThresholds` to obtain temperature thresholds; defaulting to a mock implementation for unsupported SKUs.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/thresholds/handler.go` (Multiple timestamps): This file implements a `Handler` struct that retrieves temperature thresholds from an override file (JSON format) if it exists and has a matching SKU or a wildcard entry ("*"), otherwise falling back to default thresholds.  The thresholds are converted to millidegrees Celsius. Changes between 11:14 AM and 11:17 AM improved error handling and logging and removed unnecessary comments.  A validation function `validThresholds` ensures that the override file contains only valid sensor types.

In summary, the code updates focus on improving the robustness and clarity of the temperature threshold management in the Chassis Manager application, primarily for Leopard platforms, by adding comprehensive error handling, better SKU resolution,  and more informative logging messages.  The use of override files allows for flexible configuration of temperature thresholds.
