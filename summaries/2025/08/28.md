# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 11:18:00 AM
The log shows several code changes related to Chassis Manager, focusing on temperature threshold management.  The main changes occurred between 11:08 AM and 11:17 AM on August 28, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/main.go` (11:08:40 AM): This file is the main application entry point.  It initializes logging, retrieves system and control information (including architecture, version, and SKU-based capabilities, particularly focusing on whether the system is a "Leopard" model), creates an application instance, and runs the Chassis Manager application.  Error handling and graceful shutdown are implemented using context.Context and signals.  The code extensively uses `exec.Command` to interact with the system for information retrieval.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/thresholds/defaults.go` (Multiple timestamps): This file defines an interface `DefaultThresholds` and a mock implementation `MockDefaultThresholds`.  Minor edits refined comments and function descriptions between 11:09 AM and 11:10 AM, with no functional changes.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/platform/leopard/temperature/defaults.go` (Multiple timestamps): This file contains the main implementation of `DefaultThresholds` for Leopard platforms. It defines a `DefaultThresholds` struct containing a map of SKUs to temperature thresholds for different hardware regions ("mainboard," "cpu," "mac").  The `resolveSKU` function attempts to map the input SKU to a known SKU family or base SKU from the `platform` package.  Changes between 11:11 AM and 11:17 AM involved refining comments and improving the `resolveSKU` function to log a warning instead of an error if no matching SKU is found and to return the original SKU in such cases.


`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/manager_factory.go` (11:13:30 AM): This file contains the `NewTemperatureManager` function, which creates a temperature manager based on the runtime state and uses `platformTemps.NewDefaultThresholds` to obtain temperature thresholds; defaulting to a mock implementation for unsupported SKUs.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/thresholds/handler.go` (Multiple timestamps): This file implements a `Handler` struct that retrieves temperature thresholds from an override file (JSON format) if it exists and has a matching SKU or a wildcard entry ("*"), otherwise falling back to default thresholds.  The thresholds are converted to millidegrees Celsius. Changes between 11:14 AM and 11:17 AM improved error handling and logging and removed unnecessary comments.  A validation function `validThresholds` ensures that the override file contains only valid sensor types.

In summary, the code updates focus on improving the robustness and clarity of the temperature threshold management in the Chassis Manager application, primarily for Leopard platforms, by adding comprehensive error handling, better SKU resolution,  and more informative logging messages.  The use of override files allows for flexible configuration of temperature thresholds.


## 1:17:58 PM
The log shows multiple code changes within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager` directory on August 28th, 2025, between 12:28 PM and 12:30 PM.  The changes primarily focus on temperature sensor information and LED management for a platform called "Leopard".

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/temperature/thresholds/sensor_info.go`: This file defines an interface `SensorInfo` and a mock implementation `MockSensorInfo` for handling temperature thresholds.  The mock implementation returns default values. This change happened at 12:28:20 PM.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/state/led/state.go`: This file defines a `State` struct to manage LED state information, including system LED and PHY (physical layer) LED states.  It provides methods for setting and getting LED states and managing port mappings. This change happened at 12:28:42 PM.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/platform/leopard/temperature/sensor_info.go`: This file contains multiple revisions, all at slightly different times (12:28:57 PM, 12:29:15 PM, 12:29:53 PM, 12:30:53 PM). This file implements the `SensorInfo` interface specifically for the Leopard platform.  The code retrieves temperature thresholds based on the SKU (Stock Keeping Unit), handling cases where the SKU needs resolution to a family or base SKU.  The `GetReadableSensorName` function maps sensor names to human-readable descriptions.  Several minor updates to this file include changes in error message casing and whitespace.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/platform/leopard/led/phy.go`: This file contains mappings between CPLD (Complex Programmable Logic Device) port indices, CPSS (Customer Premises Service Switch) port indices, and silkscreen labels for PHY LEDs on the Leopard platform. It also defines a function `mapPhyStatusToLED` to determine LED behavior based on PHY status. This change happened at 12:30:30 PM.

In summary, the code changes demonstrate development work on a chassis management system for the Leopard platform.  The major focus is on robust handling of temperature sensors and LED control, including SKU resolution for temperature thresholds and mapping between different port numbering schemes for LEDs.  The repeated modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/platform/leopard/temperature/sensor_info.go` suggest iterative refinement and debugging during development.
