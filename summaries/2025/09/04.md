# Activity Summary for 9/4/2025

## 10:14:39 AM
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector` directory, focusing primarily on the `CrlDownloader.hpp` and `CrlDownloader.cpp` files, and  `ICrlDownloader.hpp`.  The changes span from 9:44 AM to 10:05 AM on September 4th, 2025.

**`ICrlDownloader.hpp`:** This header file, defining the interface for CRL download, underwent two revisions.  The first (9:44:32 AM and 9:44:41 AM) added a `updateCrlFileState()`  virtual function to the `ICrlDownloader` struct.

**`CrlDownloader.hpp`:** This header file, containing the implementation of the CRL downloader, was modified several times.  The most significant changes involve the addition of a `CrlFileStateChanged` boolean variable (9:46:31 AM) and no functional changes.

**`CrlDownloader.cpp`:** This file, containing the implementation of the CRL downloader,  saw several revisions.  The core functionality of the `CrlDownloader` class remained consistent across the changes, focusing on downloading, managing, and updating CRLs. A notable change at (9:47:48 AM) was the addition of `CrlFileStateChanged = true;` within the `removeIssuer` function, indicating a change in how CRL file state updates are handled. A later modification (9:49:46 AM) removed a call to `handleCrlStateChanges()` in the `removeIssuer` function. The final revision (10:05:56 AM) removed a comment that was questioning the removal of the `handleCrlStateChanges()` call in the `removeIssuer` function, suggesting the removal was intentional.


Recurring patterns include:

* Extensive use of asynchronous operations (e.g., `threadPool.enqueueWithFuture`) for handling CRL downloads and updates, suggesting a focus on non-blocking operations and concurrency.
*  Error and log handling using macros like `TraceLog`, `DebugLog`, and `ErrorLog`, indicating a robust logging and error-handling strategy.
*  Exponential backoff retry mechanism for failed CRL downloads.


The updates appear to be incremental improvements and bug fixes related to the CRL downloader's state management and error handling, specifically concerning the handling of CRL file state changes and the removal of issuers.
