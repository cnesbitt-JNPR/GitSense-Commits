# Activity Summary for 9/5/2025

## 10:15:03 AM
The log shows a single update to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file at 9/5/2025, 9:54:22 AM.  This file contains SSH host keys for various IP addresses and hostnames.  The entries include  `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` key types. Multiple keys are present for some hosts (e.g., 10.27.15.13, 10.27.35.50, 10.27.35.34, 10.27.35.129, 10.27.35.27, 10.27.60.106).  The IP addresses appear to belong to a single 10.27.x.x subnet, with a few exceptions like `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` and `[127.0.0.1]:12801` (localhost).  The `ssh-rsa` keys are significantly longer than the others.
