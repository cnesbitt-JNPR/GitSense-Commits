The log shows a single update to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file at 9/5/2025, 9:54:22 AM.  This file contains SSH host keys for various IP addresses and hostnames.  The entries include  `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` key types. Multiple keys are present for some hosts (e.g., 10.27.15.13, 10.27.35.50, 10.27.35.34, 10.27.35.129, 10.27.35.27, 10.27.60.106).  The IP addresses appear to belong to a single 10.27.x.x subnet, with a few exceptions like `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` and `[127.0.0.1]:12801` (localhost).  The `ssh-rsa` keys are significantly longer than the others.


## 12:58:18 PM
The log shows modifications to three files across several timestamps on September 5th, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` underwent multiple revisions between 10:23 AM and 11:47 AM.  The changes primarily involved the `removeIssuer` function. Initially, this function only removed an issuer. Later versions added the functionality to remove multiple issuers using a new `removeIssuers` function.  There is also  extensive use of  `std::this_thread::sleep_for` for synchronization, suggesting potential timing-related issues in the code.  The test cases (`testBasicCrlDownload`, `testRemoveIssuer`, `testModifyIssuer`, `testMultipleIssuers`, `testRetries`, `testRotation`, `testRotateExisting`, `testRotatesCorrectOrderExisting`) demonstrate different scenarios of CRL download, removal, modification, and retry mechanisms. The tests heavily rely on mocking (`MockEventCollector`, `MockCertificateStateUpdater`) and assertions (`EXPECT_CALL`, `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`).  Debug statements (`std::cout`) were added and removed throughout the revisions, likely for debugging purposes.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/CrlEndpoint.hpp` was modified once at 10:27 AM. This revision focused on adding copy constructor, assignment operator, equality and inequality operators to the `CrlEndpoint` class, improving its functionality and integration with other parts of the system.  The use of macros (`CRL_ENDPOINT_COPY_CTOR`, `CRL_ENDPOINT_ASSIGNMT_OPERATOR`, etc.) simplifies the code generation but may reduce readability.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/CrlDownloader.hpp` was modified at 10:40 AM. This commit focused on the `CrlDownloader` class, a key component responsible for downloading and managing CRLs. The addition of  `removeIssuers` function mirrors the changes in `CrlDownloaderTest.cpp`.  The class utilizes a `TimerWheel` for scheduling CRL downloads, indicating a time-based approach to updates.  The `CrlDownloader` class extensively uses asynchronous operations via `threadPool.enqueue` and `threadPool.enqueueWithFuture`, indicating a design choice for concurrent CRL management.  Error and debug logging throughout this class suggests a robust approach to handling exceptions and debugging.

The overall pattern across changes seems to be the addition of bulk operations for both registering and removing CRL issuers, likely for efficiency improvement.  The frequent use of `threadPool.enqueue` suggests a transition from synchronous to asynchronous task execution which was likely made for better performance and responsiveness.


## 1:58:02 PM
The log shows several code changes to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/CrlDownloader.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` on September 5th, 2025.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/CrlDownloader.cpp` Updates:**

The `CrlDownloader.cpp` file underwent multiple revisions throughout the afternoon of September 5th, 2025.  The key changes center around the `updateCrlFileState()` function.  Initially, this function built a JSON object with a nested "crls" object.  Later revisions simplified this structure, removing the unnecessary nesting of the "crls" object, leading to a more concise JSON structure.  No other significant functional changes are apparent in the provided snippets.  The timestamps indicate a series of incremental updates to this file.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` Updates:**

The `CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` file also received updates.  A notable change involves the `createCrlDownloader` function, where the default `standoff` value was modified from 60 seconds to 1 second between 1:48:22 PM and 1:52:01 PM. This suggests a shift towards faster testing cycles.  The test suite itself focuses on verifying the functionality of the `CrlDownloader` class, including aspects like basic CRL downloads, issuer removal and modification, handling multiple issuers, retry mechanisms, CRL rotation, and handling existing CRL files during rotation.  The tests use mock objects for various dependencies to isolate the `CrlDownloader` class for testing.  The timestamps show that the test file remained largely consistent except for the `createCrlDownloader` change.


In summary, the code changes reflect iterative development and testing.  The primary focus in `CrlDownloader.cpp` was on improving the structure of the JSON output for CRL file state updates, while the changes in `CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` aimed to speed up testing by reducing the `standoff` time and ensure comprehensive testing of the CRL downloading and management logic.


## 2:58:15 PM
The log shows a series of code changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/` directory, focusing primarily on the `CrlDownloader.cpp` and `CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` files.  The changes span from 1:59 PM to 2:56 PM on September 5th, 2025.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/CrlDownloader.cpp`:**

The `CrlDownloader.cpp` file underwent several revisions.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: downloading and managing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) from specified endpoints.  Key changes include modifications to the `updateCrlFileState` function's JSON structure. Initially, the JSON structure for CRL file information was flawed.  Subsequent commits improved the JSON structure to accurately represent CRL information, specifically addressing the structure of the "crls" key and including debug statements to aid in development and testing.


**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/CrlDownloaderTest.cpp`:**

The `CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` file, containing unit tests for `CrlDownloader`, experienced the most significant changes across multiple commits. These revisions were primarily focused on refining the test cases and improving the accuracy of the test expectations, especially concerning JSON validation in `checkCrlFileInfoForTest` and `checkCrlFileInfoForTest2` and updating the expectations for the mock `CertificateStateUpdater` and the `MockEventCollector`. The `checkCrlFileInfo` function was introduced to handle multiple issuer names.  The use of `EXPECT_CALL` with `checkCrlFileInfo` demonstrates a move towards more robust testing of the JSON data structures handled by the `CrlDownloader`.  The debug statements in `checkCrlFileInfoForTest` indicate a focus on debugging and improving the reliability of the testing process.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* **Asynchronous operations:** The code heavily utilizes asynchronous operations through a thread pool (`threadPool`) and a timer wheel (`timerWheel`) for managing CRL downloads and retries.
* **Error Handling:**  The code includes comprehensive error handling for CRL download failures, implementing exponential backoff retry mechanisms.
* **Logging:** Extensive use of logging functions (`TraceLog`, `DebugLog`, `ErrorLog`) provides detailed information for debugging and monitoring.
* **JSON Handling:** The code frequently utilizes JSON structures for data exchange between components, particularly for reporting CRL download status and errors.  Multiple commits directly focused on improving the accuracy and structure of these JSON outputs.


In summary, the code changes primarily involve enhancing the CRL management system's reliability through improved error handling, asynchronous operations, and more robust unit testing focusing on JSON validation and ensuring proper interaction with mock components. The timestamped commits reveal a period of active development and testing centered around correctly handling the CRL data structures.


## 3:58:07 PM
The log shows a series of changes to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/CrlDownloader.cpp` between 2:58 PM and 3:47 PM on September 5th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on unit testing (`CrlDownloaderTest.cpp`) and implementation (`CrlDownloader.cpp`) of a CRL (Certificate Revocation List) downloader.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` Updates:**

Multiple revisions of `CrlDownloaderTest.cpp`  show additions and modifications to unit tests.  The tests cover various scenarios including:

* **`testBasicCrlDownload`:**  Verifies the basic functionality of downloading CRLs, expecting 4-5 downloads and verification of 2 files.
* **`testRemoveIssuer`:** Checks the removal of an issuer and its associated CRLs.  Added expectations for `updateCrlFileInfo` to reflect the empty state after removal.
* **`testModifyIssuer`:** Tests modifying an issuer's URI and subsequent download from the new location, asserting that the correct number of downloads occur from each URI.  The added calls for `updateCrlFileInfo` account for both the initial and final states.
* **`testMultipleIssuers`:**  Tests handling multiple CRL issuers simultaneously.
* **`testRetries`:** Covers retry mechanisms upon download failure, using mocks to verify expected calls for unreachable endpoints, and a successful download after recovering from the simulated failure.
* **`testRotation`:**  Added to test the rotation mechanism in the CRL downloader; modified to increase expected number of downloads to 10.
* **`testRotateExisting`:** A new test added at the end, partially visible in the last log entry, suggesting tests for handling existing files during rotation are being implemented.

The timestamps indicate iterative refinement of the tests. The addition of `testRotateExisting` suggests a new feature or bug fix focused on CRL file rotation is being developed.  Throughout the `CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` revisions, there's a consistent pattern of using mocks (e.g., `MockCertificateStateUpdater`, `MockEventCollector`) for testing purposes and verification of expected method calls using `EXPECT_CALL`.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/CrlDownloader.cpp` Updates:**

The `CrlDownloader.cpp` file undergoes several revisions, primarily adding logging statements and improving error handling.  Key changes include:

* Addition of detailed logging using `TraceLog`, `DebugLog`, and `ErrorLog` at various points within the `CrlDownloader` class methods.  This improves the traceability of the CRL download process.
*  Improvements to the `getEventDynamic` method to include more detailed information for logging successful CRL updates, including added and removed entries.  This was added in one of the final revisions.
* Removal of unnecessary debug print statements from `checkCrlFileInfo`.
* Removal of `debug` print statements from various methods, such as `scheduledCrlDownload`, `scheduleBulkCrlDownloads`, and `updateCrlFileState`.


The consistent use of `threadPool.enqueue` and `threadPool.enqueueWithFuture` shows a design choice to perform CRL downloads and other operations asynchronously. The changes in this file also appear to reflect an effort toward enhanced logging and making the code more robust.  The final revision of this file adds functionality to `getEventDynamic` to capture added and removed CRL entries.


## 4:58:03 PM
The log shows multiple revisions of C++ code related to state management and testing.  `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateTestLiterals.hpp` was modified at 3:58:16 PM on September 5th, 2025. This file contains numerous constant declarations, primarily `state::NtpServerState` objects with slightly varying values and a series of JSON string literals representing different states (e.g., `ntpServersJson`, `certificateExpirationJson`, `chassisManagerSafeTempJson`,  `chassisManagerHighTempJson`, `chassisManagerCriticalTempJson`, and `chassisManagerShutdownTempJson`).  These JSON structures suggest a system monitoring various components and their states (NTP servers, certificates, chassis temperatures).

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateTest.cpp` underwent three revisions between 4:00:28 PM and 4:13:59 PM on September 5th, 2025.  This file contains test code, including classes `TestObjects` and `MockPda`, demonstrating interaction with a persistent data layer (`pd::PersistentDataClient`, `pd::PersistentDataController`). The code defines various test fixtures (e.g., `assetId`, `alarmSourceCadillac`, `nodeName`) and functions for verifying states.  Recurring patterns show extensive use of the `dolly` library (for strings, JSON, IP addresses, etc.) and the `gtest` testing framework.  The modifications in this file likely involve adjustments to the test setup, assertions, or mocking mechanisms.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/lib/state/test/StateObserverTest.cpp` was modified four times between 4:32:21 PM and 4:41:30 PM on September 5th, 2025. This file focuses on testing a `state::Observer` class. The `TestStateObserver` class extensively monitors different aspects of the system (assets, interfaces, processes, etc., indicated by various member `WatchContext` objects). The file includes functions to verify observer behavior (e.g., `verifyInvokedAndDeleted`, `verifyInvokedAndModified`) and employs a `ChangeNotifier` for asynchronous notifications.  The multiple revisions point to iterative debugging and refinements in testing the observer's responses to state changes.
