# Activity Summary for 9/5/2025

## 10:15:03 AM
The log shows a single update to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file at 9/5/2025, 9:54:22 AM.  This file contains SSH host keys for various IP addresses and hostnames.  The entries include  `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` key types. Multiple keys are present for some hosts (e.g., 10.27.15.13, 10.27.35.50, 10.27.35.34, 10.27.35.129, 10.27.35.27, 10.27.60.106).  The IP addresses appear to belong to a single 10.27.x.x subnet, with a few exceptions like `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` and `[127.0.0.1]:12801` (localhost).  The `ssh-rsa` keys are significantly longer than the others.


## 12:58:18 PM
The log shows modifications to three files across several timestamps on September 5th, 2025.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` underwent multiple revisions between 10:23 AM and 11:47 AM.  The changes primarily involved the `removeIssuer` function. Initially, this function only removed an issuer. Later versions added the functionality to remove multiple issuers using a new `removeIssuers` function.  There is also  extensive use of  `std::this_thread::sleep_for` for synchronization, suggesting potential timing-related issues in the code.  The test cases (`testBasicCrlDownload`, `testRemoveIssuer`, `testModifyIssuer`, `testMultipleIssuers`, `testRetries`, `testRotation`, `testRotateExisting`, `testRotatesCorrectOrderExisting`) demonstrate different scenarios of CRL download, removal, modification, and retry mechanisms. The tests heavily rely on mocking (`MockEventCollector`, `MockCertificateStateUpdater`) and assertions (`EXPECT_CALL`, `EXPECT_EQ`, `ASSERT_TRUE`).  Debug statements (`std::cout`) were added and removed throughout the revisions, likely for debugging purposes.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/CrlEndpoint.hpp` was modified once at 10:27 AM. This revision focused on adding copy constructor, assignment operator, equality and inequality operators to the `CrlEndpoint` class, improving its functionality and integration with other parts of the system.  The use of macros (`CRL_ENDPOINT_COPY_CTOR`, `CRL_ENDPOINT_ASSIGNMT_OPERATOR`, etc.) simplifies the code generation but may reduce readability.

`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/CrlDownloader.hpp` was modified at 10:40 AM. This commit focused on the `CrlDownloader` class, a key component responsible for downloading and managing CRLs. The addition of  `removeIssuers` function mirrors the changes in `CrlDownloaderTest.cpp`.  The class utilizes a `TimerWheel` for scheduling CRL downloads, indicating a time-based approach to updates.  The `CrlDownloader` class extensively uses asynchronous operations via `threadPool.enqueue` and `threadPool.enqueueWithFuture`, indicating a design choice for concurrent CRL management.  Error and debug logging throughout this class suggests a robust approach to handling exceptions and debugging.

The overall pattern across changes seems to be the addition of bulk operations for both registering and removing CRL issuers, likely for efficiency improvement.  The frequent use of `threadPool.enqueue` suggests a transition from synchronous to asynchronous task execution which was likely made for better performance and responsiveness.
