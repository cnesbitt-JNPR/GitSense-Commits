The log shows a single code change on September 8th, 2025, at 1:08:32 PM, affecting `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/MockCrlDownloader.hpp`.  This file contains a mock implementation of a CRL (Certificate Revocation List) downloader.  The `MockCrlDownloader` class uses Google Mock (`gmock`) to mock various methods related to CRL management, including registering and removing issuers, handling downloads (success and failure), managing unreachable URIs, and setting refresh standoffs.  The methods are extensively mocked using `MOCK_METHOD` macros, indicating a focus on testing the interactions with this component rather than its internal implementation details.  The code also includes several helper methods (`registerIssuersImpl`, `removeIssuersImpl`, `setRefreshStandoffImpl`) suggesting a potential separation of concerns or an abstraction layer.  The copyright notice indicates that the code is owned by Juniper Networks.
