# Activity Summary for 9/11/2025

## 10:13:34 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/MockCertificateStateUpdater.hpp` between 9:48 AM and 10:10 AM on September 11, 2025, and to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` at 10:06:07 AM on the same day.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/MockCertificateStateUpdater.hpp` file underwent several revisions focusing on the `crlFileUpdated` method.  Initially, it was a `MOCK_METHOD0`, then it became a method with an explicit override in the `updateCrlFileInfo` function, and finally, it was modified to accept a string argument (`const std::string& crlFileInfo`) and changed from a `MOCK_METHOD0` to `MOCK_METHOD1`. A member variable `latestCrlFileInfo` was added to store the latest CRL file information.  The changes reflect a shift from a simple mock function to one that actively processes and stores CRL file information.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` file contains a comprehensive unit test suite for `CrlDownloader`.  The tests cover basic CRL download functionality (`testBasicCrlDownload`), issuer removal and modification (`testRemoveIssuer`, `testModifyIssuer`), handling multiple issuers (`testMultipleIssuers`), retry mechanisms (`testRetries`), CRL rotation (`testRotation`, `testRotateExisting`), and potentially more (the log is truncated). The tests heavily utilize  `EXPECT_CALL`, `Times`, and `VerifyRecordEvent` from the Google Test framework, indicating a thorough approach to testing various scenarios and edge cases in the `CrlDownloader` class.  The test suite uses mock objects and helper functions to manage the testing environment, including setup and teardown methods to create and clean up temporary files and network resources. The tests interact with mock objects to simulate system interactions and assert expected behavior.  The code shows that the tests perform actions such as registering and removing CRL issuers, downloading CRL files, and verifying file contents and download counts.  Timestamp for this file is 10:06:07 AM, suggesting this file was changed after the series of changes on `MockCertificateStateUpdater.hpp`
