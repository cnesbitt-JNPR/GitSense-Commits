# Activity Summary for 9/11/2025

## 10:13:34 AM
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/MockCertificateStateUpdater.hpp` between 9:48 AM and 10:10 AM on September 11, 2025, and to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` at 10:06:07 AM on the same day.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/MockCertificateStateUpdater.hpp` file underwent several revisions focusing on the `crlFileUpdated` method.  Initially, it was a `MOCK_METHOD0`, then it became a method with an explicit override in the `updateCrlFileInfo` function, and finally, it was modified to accept a string argument (`const std::string& crlFileInfo`) and changed from a `MOCK_METHOD0` to `MOCK_METHOD1`. A member variable `latestCrlFileInfo` was added to store the latest CRL file information.  The changes reflect a shift from a simple mock function to one that actively processes and stores CRL file information.

The `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` file contains a comprehensive unit test suite for `CrlDownloader`.  The tests cover basic CRL download functionality (`testBasicCrlDownload`), issuer removal and modification (`testRemoveIssuer`, `testModifyIssuer`), handling multiple issuers (`testMultipleIssuers`), retry mechanisms (`testRetries`), CRL rotation (`testRotation`, `testRotateExisting`), and potentially more (the log is truncated). The tests heavily utilize  `EXPECT_CALL`, `Times`, and `VerifyRecordEvent` from the Google Test framework, indicating a thorough approach to testing various scenarios and edge cases in the `CrlDownloader` class.  The test suite uses mock objects and helper functions to manage the testing environment, including setup and teardown methods to create and clean up temporary files and network resources. The tests interact with mock objects to simulate system interactions and assert expected behavior.  The code shows that the tests perform actions such as registering and removing CRL issuers, downloading CRL files, and verifying file contents and download counts.  Timestamp for this file is 10:06:07 AM, suggesting this file was changed after the series of changes on `MockCertificateStateUpdater.hpp`

## 12:13:51 PM
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/CrlDownloaderTest.cpp`.  The file contains unit tests for a `CrlDownloader` class.  The changes primarily focus on refining the test cases and their assertions.

The earliest timestamp is 9/11/2025, 10:13:38 AM, showing the initial version of the `CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` file, which includes a comprehensive test suite covering various aspects of the `CrlDownloader` functionality, including basic CRL downloads, issuer registration and removal, handling multiple issuers, retry mechanisms for unreachable endpoints, and file rotation.  The code utilizes Google Test framework (`gtest/gtest.h`) and mocks (`gmock/gmock.h`) for testing. The `CrlDownloader` class interacts with `MockCertificateStateUpdater` and `MockEventCollector`.

Between 10:13:38 AM and 10:23:48 AM, several revisions occurred. These revisions primarily involved adding `EXPECT_BECOMES_TRUE` and `EXPECT_BECOMES_EQ` assertions to verify the state of `mockCertificateStateUpdater.latestCrlFileInfo` after various operations (registering, removing, and modifying issuers).  This suggests a focus on improving the test's ability to verify state changes accurately.

At 10:35:20 AM, a change was made to  `testBasicCrlDownload` adding an assertion `EXPECT_BECOMES_TRUE(testApplication->getPollerThread().isExiting());` after `crlDownloader.stop();`. This indicates a more thorough check on thread termination. Further revisions around this time consistently replaced `isExiting()` with `isShutdown()` in several tests, indicating a shift toward ensuring complete thread shutdown verification.

A notable change at 10:40:21 AM involved modifying `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/MockCertificateStateUpdater.hpp`. This header file defines a mock class (`MockCertificateStateUpdater`), adding a new method `updateCrlFileInfo`. This indicates an evolution in the way CRL file information is updated and tracked within the tests.

Subsequent changes between 10:44:37 AM and 11:50:05 AM continued to refine the test cases.  Several tests were modified to use `EXPECT_BECOMES_EQ` for more precise checks on `numDownloads1` and `numDownloads2`. The `handleGetCrlInconsistent` function in `CrlDownloaderTest.cpp` was modified to use a mutex (`inconsistentUrlMutex`) to ensure thread safety when updating the `inconsistentUrlSucceeds` flag. This improvement addresses potential race conditions. At 11:49:53 AM, a counter `inconsistentDownloadAttempts` was added in `handleGetCrlInconsistent` to track the number of download attempts for the inconsistent URL.

The final change at 12:00:52 PM involved updating assertions in `testBasicCrlDownload` and `testRemoveIssuer` to make the number of file verifications more flexible (`verifyFiles` now uses `numDownloads1` as a parameter for the number of expected files). The `testRetries` function also received modifications concerning expectation calls.

In summary, the code evolution demonstrates an iterative refinement of the unit test suite for `CrlDownloader`. The changes suggest a growing emphasis on ensuring that the tests comprehensively cover all aspects of the class's behavior, including error handling, thread management, and state transitions, with the introduction of mutexes to prevent race conditions and increased accuracy in assertions.
