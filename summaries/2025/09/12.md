# Activity Summary for 9/12/2025

## 10:24:33 AM
The log shows several revisions to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/ConfigDirector/test/CrlDownloaderTest.cpp`.  The file is a C++ unit test for a `CrlDownloader` class. Key changes across revisions involve refinements to the `verifyNumDownloads` function's logic to handle potential race conditions more accurately, specifically handling the case where an extra download might occur during the `stop()` call.  This is reflected in comments within the function itself and the change in the parameter types from `int` to `size_t`.

The timestamps indicate a series of modifications made within a short timeframe on September 12th, 2025, between approximately 9:27 AM and 9:39 AM.  There is no substantive change to the core functionality or test cases between the revisions. The code consistently uses Google Test (`gtest`) framework and involves testing various scenarios like basic CRL downloads, issuer registration and removal, issuer modification, handling multiple issuers, and retry mechanisms. The `/tmp/testCrls` directory is used for temporary CRL file storage during testing, created and cleaned in `SetUpTestCase` and `TearDownTestCase` respectively.  The tests extensively use mock objects (`MockCertificateStateUpdater`, `MockEventCollector`) to isolate and test the `CrlDownloader`'s behavior.  Specific dates ("Oct 17 16:33:11 2024 GMT", "Oct 27 15:33:10 2024 GMT", etc.) appear in the `EXPECT_CALL` statements, likely representing timestamps used in the test assertions.  The `maxCrlFilesPerIssuer` constant consistently limits the number of CRL files per issuer to 2.
