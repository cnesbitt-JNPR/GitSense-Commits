# Activity Summary for 10/30/2025

## 2:19:33 PM
The code change log primarily details the development and refinement of a Go application named "Integrity Handler," focusing on secure file system encryption and integrity verification, often involving a Trusted Platform Module (TPM).

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/state.go`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 10/30/2025, 1:19:46 PM - 1:44:27 PM
    *   **Key Updates:**
        *   Initial definition of `appState` struct containing `path` and `tpmHandle`.
        *   **1:20:01 PM:** The `fscrypto` package import was added, enabling the use of `fsKey *fscrypto.Key` within the `appState` struct.
        *   **1:20:22 PM:** Comments were added to `appState` to clarify `tpmHandle` and `fsKey` as "lazy-loaded variables."
        *   **1:20:42 PM:** A `closeAppState` function was introduced for resource cleanup, initially handling `tpmHandle`.
        *   **1:20:59 PM:** `newAppState` was updated to explicitly initialize `fsKey` to `nil`.
        *   **1:21:24 PM - 1:22:23 PM:** The `closeAppState` function was significantly revised to focus on securely wiping key memory (`state.fsKey.Clear()` changed to `state.fsKey.Wipe()`) and adding error logging for the wipe operation. The TPM handle cleanup was removed from this function.
        *   **1:44:27 PM:** An import for the custom `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) was added, formalizing its use for error reporting in `closeAppState`.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 10/30/2025, 1:22:51 PM
    *   **Key Updates:**
        *   This entry provides the core application logic. It defines `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for process return values.
        *   It sets up logging, embeds a version string, and defines various directory paths, including `encryptedKeyPath = "/boot/femk.enc"`.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: verifying environment, creating and closing an `appState`, enabling integrity, and unlocking encrypted directories. It contains several `TODO` comments indicating future work on context handling and command-line arguments.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 10/30/2025, 1:25:45 PM - 1:44:06 PM
    *   **Key Updates:** This file underwent the most frequent and iterative changes.
        *   **1:25:45 PM:** Initial implementation with functions for verifying environment (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), enabling integrity (`enableIntegrity`), unlocking directories (`unlockEncryptedDirs`), getting crypto keys (`getCryptoKey`), creating new crypto keys (`newCryptoKey`), and ensuring directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`). It performs checks for root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command presence, and TPM initialization.
        *   **1:26:24 PM - 1:28:24 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function's signature was updated to return `(*fscrypto.Key, ExitCode, error)`. It also introduced lazy loading of the crypto key into `appState.fsKey` and added a comment to that effect.
        *   **1:29:08 PM - 1:30:12 PM:** Significant refactoring of `unlockEncryptedDirs` to utilize `getCryptoKey`, but initially introduced a bug where key decryption was attempted twice if `getCryptoKey` failed.
        *   **1:30:44 PM - 1:31:09 PM:** `unlockEncryptedDirs` was corrected by removing the redundant key decryption path. A debug log for `plainKey` was added in `getCryptoKey`.
        *   **1:37:48 PM:** `enableIntegrity` was streamlined to use the `getCryptoKey` function, removing duplicate key decryption logic. An informational log was added: "Enabling Config Integrity...".
        *   **1:40:28 PM:** `getCryptoKey` was fixed to correctly assign the created key to `state.fsKey` without shadowing, resolving a potential bug.
        *   **1:40:55 PM:** `getCryptoKey` was updated to explicitly return `ExitCompromised` on `decryptFEMK` failure, clarifying error handling.
        *   **1:43:47 PM:** Error paths in `getCryptoKey` were refined to return `nil` for the `*fscrypto.Key` when an error occurs.
        *   **1:44:06 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function was completed with a final `return state.fsKey, ExitSuccess, nil` statement.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Secure Key Management:** A dominant theme is the careful handling of cryptographic keys (`fscrypto.Key`). This includes lazy loading, explicit `nil` initialization, secure memory wiping (`Wipe()` and zeroing out slices), and dedicated functions like `newCryptoKey` and `getCryptoKey` for key creation and retrieval. Errors in key management are often categorized as `ExitCompromised`.
*   **Environmental Validation:** The `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` function consistently checks for prerequisites like root privileges, kernel version, and filesystem encryption support, along with TPM initialization.
*   **Idempotency and Error Handling:** `enableIntegrity` is commented as needing to be idempotent, and robust error handling with specific `ExitCode` returns (`ExitFailure`, `ExitCompromised`, `ExitIncompatible`) is prevalent throughout the application.
*   **`TODO` Comments:** Numerous `TODO` comments are scattered throughout the code, indicating areas for future work, improvements, or design considerations (e.g., context handling, command-line parsing, manifest processing).
*   **Iterative Refinement:** There are many consecutive commits to `integrity.go` and `state.go` with minor adjustments, indicating an iterative development style to fix bugs, improve clarity, and complete function logic (e.g., the progressive completion of `getCryptoKey`'s return statements).
*   **Dependency on External Libraries:** The project heavily relies on `github.com/google/go-tpm`, `github.com/google/fscrypt`, and `github.com/spf13/afero` for TPM interaction, filesystem encryption, and abstract filesystem operations, respectively. It also uses a custom `log` package.
*   **Juniper Networks Copyright:** All files begin with a consistent Juniper Networks copyright notice for the year 2025.
