    *   **Timestamp Range:** 10/30/2025, 1:25:45 PM - 1:44:06 PM
    *   **Key Updates:** This file underwent the most frequent and iterative changes.
        *   **1:25:45 PM:** Initial implementation with functions for verifying environment (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), enabling integrity (`enableIntegrity`), unlocking directories (`unlockEncryptedDirs`), getting crypto keys (`getCryptoKey`), creating new crypto keys (`newCryptoKey`), and ensuring directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`). It performs checks for root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command presence, and TPM initialization.
        *   **1:26:24 PM - 1:28:24 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function's signature was updated to return `(*fscrypto.Key, ExitCode, error)`. It also introduced lazy loading of the crypto key into `appState.fsKey` and added a comment to that effect.
        *   **1:29:08 PM - 1:30:12 PM:** Significant refactoring of `unlockEncryptedDirs` to utilize `getCryptoKey`, but initially introduced a bug where key decryption was attempted twice if `getCryptoKey` failed.
        *   **1:30:44 PM - 1:31:09 PM:** `unlockEncryptedDirs` was corrected by removing the redundant key decryption path. A debug log for `plainKey` was added in `getCryptoKey`.
        *   **1:37:48 PM:** `enableIntegrity` was streamlined to use the `getCryptoKey` function, removing duplicate key decryption logic. An informational log was added: "Enabling Config Integrity...".
        *   **1:40:28 PM:** `getCryptoKey` was fixed to correctly assign the created key to `state.fsKey` without shadowing, resolving a potential bug.
        *   **1:40:55 PM:** `getCryptoKey` was updated to explicitly return `ExitCompromised` on `decryptFEMK` failure, clarifying error handling.
        *   **1:43:47 PM:** Error paths in `getCryptoKey` were refined to return `nil` for the `*fscrypto.Key` when an error occurs.
        *   **1:44:06 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function was completed with a final `return state.fsKey, ExitSuccess, nil` statement.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Secure Key Management:** A dominant theme is the careful handling of cryptographic keys (`fscrypto.Key`). This includes lazy loading, explicit `nil` initialization, secure memory wiping (`Wipe()` and zeroing out slices), and dedicated functions like `newCryptoKey` and `getCryptoKey` for key creation and retrieval. Errors in key management are often categorized as `ExitCompromised`.
*   **Environmental Validation:** The `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` function consistently checks for prerequisites like root privileges, kernel version, and filesystem encryption support, along with TPM initialization.
*   **Idempotency and Error Handling:** `enableIntegrity` is commented as needing to be idempotent, and robust error handling with specific `ExitCode` returns (`ExitFailure`, `ExitCompromised`, `ExitIncompatible`) is prevalent throughout the application.
*   **`TODO` Comments:** Numerous `TODO` comments are scattered throughout the code, indicating areas for future work, improvements, or design considerations (e.g., context handling, command-line parsing, manifest processing).
*   **Iterative Refinement:** There are many consecutive commits to `integrity.go` and `state.go` with minor adjustments, indicating an iterative development style to fix bugs, improve clarity, and complete function logic (e.g., the progressive completion of `getCryptoKey`'s return statements).
*   **Dependency on External Libraries:** The project heavily relies on `github.com/google/go-tpm`, `github.com/google/fscrypt`, and `github.com/spf13/afero` for TPM interaction, filesystem encryption, and abstract filesystem operations, respectively. It also uses a custom `log` package.
*   **Juniper Networks Copyright:** All files begin with a consistent Juniper Networks copyright notice for the year 2025.

## 3:19:30 PM
**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/state.go`**

This file defines the `appState` structure and its associated lifecycle management functions for the Integrity Handler application.
- **Initial Setup (10/30/2025, 1:19:46 PM - 1:20:22 PM):** The `appState` struct was introduced, holding `path`, `tpmHandle`, and `fsKey`. The `fscrypto` package was imported, and a comment `// lazy-loaded variables:` was added to clarify the intended behavior of `tpmHandle` and `fsKey`.
- **Resource Cleanup Evolution (10/30/2025, 1:20:42 PM - 1:22:23 PM):** The `closeAppState` function was introduced to handle resource cleanup. Initially, it included logic for closing a TPM handle. This quickly evolved to primarily focus on securely wiping the `fsKey` (filesystem encryption key) memory using `state.fsKey.Wipe()`, with error logging for failed wipe operations. The `newAppState` function was updated to explicitly initialize `fsKey` to `nil`.
- **Logging Integration (10/30/2025, 1:44:27 PM):** The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package was imported, enabling structured logging within the file.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**

This file outlines the main execution flow and entry point of the Integrity Handler application.
- **Initial Implementation (10/30/2025, 1:22:51 PM):** The entire content of this file appeared in a single change. It defines custom `ExitCode` constants to indicate various application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised). Key application directories and an embedded version string are declared. The `main` function sets up logging, calls the `run` function, and manages the process exit code. The `run` function orchestrates the application's core logic: initializing `appState`, verifying the environment, enabling integrity, and unlocking encrypted directories, ensuring `closeAppState` is deferred for cleanup.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**

This file contains the core logic for environment verification, integrity enablement, and encrypted directory management, with a strong focus on cryptographic key handling.
- **Initial Feature Set (10/30/2025, 1:25:45 PM):** The file was introduced with functions `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking system requirements like root user, kernel, filesystem encryption, and TPM), `enableIntegrity` (for creating/decrypting FEMK and encrypting directories), `unlockEncryptedDirs` (for decrypting FEMK and unlocking directories), `newCryptoKey` (for creating and securely wiping keys), and `ensureDirectoriesExist`. An incomplete `getCryptoKey` function was also present.
- **Lazy Key Loading Refinement (10/30/2025, 1:26:24 PM - 1:44:06 PM):** The `getCryptoKey` function underwent significant iterative development.
    - Its signature was updated to return `(*fscrypto.Key, ExitCode, error)` (1:26:24 PM).
    - Logic was added to check if `state.fsKey` is already loaded, returning it if so (1:26:39 PM).
    - Key decryption and creation were moved into `getCryptoKey`, and the resulting key was stored in `state.fsKey` for reuse (1:28:24 PM, 1:40:28 PM).
    - Error handling within `getCryptoKey` was progressively corrected to match its new return signature (1:40:55 PM, 1:43:47 PM).
    - A final return statement was added to complete the lazy-loading pattern (1:44:06 PM).
- **Function Refactoring (10/30/2025, 1:29:08 PM - 1:37:48 PM):** The `unlockEncryptedDirs` and `enableIntegrity` functions were refactored to utilize the evolving `getCryptoKey` for key retrieval, eliminating redundant key decryption and wiping logic previously present in these functions. This significantly streamlined their implementations. Logging for "Enabling Config Integrity..." was added to `enableIntegrity`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

-   **Concentrated Development:** All recorded changes occurred on 10/30/2025, within a concise timeframe, indicating an active development or debugging session.
-   **Security-First Design:** A clear and consistent theme is the strong emphasis on security, particularly with `fscrypto` for encryption, TPM integration for key protection, and explicit memory wiping (`fsKey.Wipe()`, zeroing out byte slices) to prevent key leakage.
-   **Lazy Loading for Keys:** The extensive iteration on `getCryptoKey` and its integration into other functions highlights a pattern of implementing lazy-loading for cryptographic keys, ensuring keys are only decrypted and instantiated when needed, and then cached within `appState`.
-   **Robust Error Handling:** The code consistently uses custom `ExitCode` values and `fmt.Errorf` with wrapped errors, along with `log.Errorf` for detailed error reporting, demonstrating a focus on robust error management.
-   **"TODO" Comments:** Throughout the code, "TODO" comments indicate areas for future work, such as context plumbing, command-line argument parsing, and advanced manifest processing.

## 4:19:24 PM
The code changes primarily involve two Go files: `state.go`, defining the application's state, and `integrity.go`, implementing core integrity and encryption logic, with a single entry for `main.go`. All changes occurred on **October 30, 2025**, within a span of approximately 25 minutes.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/state.go`**

*   **1:19:46 PM - 1:20:01 PM:** The initial `appState` structure, containing `path`, `tpmHandle`, and `fsKey`, was defined. A critical update at 1:20:01 PM added the `fscrypto "github.com/google/fscrypt/crypto"` import, resolving the type for `fsKey`.
*   **1:20:22 PM:** A comment was added to `appState` indicating `tpmHandle` and `fsKey` are "lazy-loaded variables."
*   **1:20:42 PM - 1:22:23 PM:** The `closeAppState` function underwent significant evolution. Initially, it handled closing the `tpmHandle`. Subsequently, its focus shifted to securely wiping the `fsKey` memory, first using `Clear()`, then `Wipe()` with error logging. The logic for closing the `tpmHandle` was removed during this transition.
*   **1:20:59 PM:** The `newAppState` function was updated to explicitly initialize `fsKey` as `nil`.
*   **1:44:27 PM:** The `log "github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log"` import was added, making the error logging calls within `closeAppState` valid.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**

*   **1:22:51 PM:** This single entry defines the application's entry point and overall flow. It sets up logging, defines `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised), and specifies various application-related directory paths (e.g., `/opt/128technology/integrity`, `/boot/femk.enc`). The `main` function orchestrates the `run` function, which in turn verifies the environment, enables integrity, and unlocks encrypted directories, ensuring proper cleanup via `defer closeAppState`.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**

*   **1:25:45 PM:** The file was introduced with functions for environment verification (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), enabling integrity (`enableIntegrity`), unlocking encrypted directories (`unlockEncryptedDirs`), creating cryptographic keys (`newCryptoKey`), and ensuring necessary directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`). It performs checks for root privileges, kernel version, fscrypt support, and TPM initialization.
*   **1:26:24 PM - 1:26:39 PM:** The signature of `getCryptoKey` was updated to include `ExitCode` in its return, although the function's implementation remained incomplete regarding successful returns.
*   **1:28:24 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function was intended to lazy-load `state.fsKey` but initially used a redeclaration (`:=`) instead of assignment (`=`), creating a local variable.
*   **1:29:08 PM - 1:30:12 PM:** The `unlockEncryptedDirs` function was refactored to use `getCryptoKey`. However, an initial implementation contained redundant key decryption/creation logic as a fallback if `getCryptoKey` returned an error.
*   **1:30:44 PM:** The redundant key decryption logic in `unlockEncryptedDirs` was removed, streamlining error handling for `getCryptoKey`.
*   **1:31:09 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function still had the local variable redeclaration issue for `state.fsKey`.
*   **1:37:48 PM:** The `enableIntegrity` function was updated to leverage `getCryptoKey` for key acquisition and included an informational log message.
*   **1:40:28 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function was corrected to properly assign the created key to `state.fsKey` (`state.fsKey = key`).
*   **1:40:55 PM:** The `defer` block for key wiping was removed from `getCryptoKey`, as the key is now stored in `appState` and managed by `closeAppState`.
*   **1:43:47 PM - 1:44:06 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function's error return values were made consistent, and finally, a successful return statement (`return state.fsKey, ExitSuccess, nil`) was added, completing its implementation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security Focus:** The codebase consistently addresses security, particularly filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and hardware-backed integrity using TPM, evident in key wiping, environment checks, and the explicit handling of integrity violations.
*   **State Management:** The `appState` struct serves as a central hub for application-wide objects, with `newAppState` for initialization and `closeAppState` for resource cleanup.
*   **Error Handling:** A strong emphasis on robust error handling is seen through the pervasive use of `fmt.Errorf` to wrap errors and specific `ExitCode` values for different failure types.
*   **Logging:** The `log` package is widely used for debugging, warnings, and error reporting, with `log.Debug`, `log.Warnf`, `log.Errorf`, and `log.Infof` calls sprinkled throughout.
*   **"TODO" Comments:** Numerous "TODO" comments indicate areas of ongoing development, potential improvements, or known limitations, suggesting an active development phase.
*   **Copyright:** All files include the standard Juniper Networks copyright notice.
