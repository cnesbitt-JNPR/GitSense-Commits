## 3:19:30 PM
**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/state.go`**

This file defines the `appState` structure and its associated lifecycle management functions for the Integrity Handler application.
- **Initial Setup (10/30/2025, 1:19:46 PM - 1:20:22 PM):** The `appState` struct was introduced, holding `path`, `tpmHandle`, and `fsKey`. The `fscrypto` package was imported, and a comment `// lazy-loaded variables:` was added to clarify the intended behavior of `tpmHandle` and `fsKey`.
- **Resource Cleanup Evolution (10/30/2025, 1:20:42 PM - 1:22:23 PM):** The `closeAppState` function was introduced to handle resource cleanup. Initially, it included logic for closing a TPM handle. This quickly evolved to primarily focus on securely wiping the `fsKey` (filesystem encryption key) memory using `state.fsKey.Wipe()`, with error logging for failed wipe operations. The `newAppState` function was updated to explicitly initialize `fsKey` to `nil`.
- **Logging Integration (10/30/2025, 1:44:27 PM):** The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package was imported, enabling structured logging within the file.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**

This file outlines the main execution flow and entry point of the Integrity Handler application.
- **Initial Implementation (10/30/2025, 1:22:51 PM):** The entire content of this file appeared in a single change. It defines custom `ExitCode` constants to indicate various application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised). Key application directories and an embedded version string are declared. The `main` function sets up logging, calls the `run` function, and manages the process exit code. The `run` function orchestrates the application's core logic: initializing `appState`, verifying the environment, enabling integrity, and unlocking encrypted directories, ensuring `closeAppState` is deferred for cleanup.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**

This file contains the core logic for environment verification, integrity enablement, and encrypted directory management, with a strong focus on cryptographic key handling.
- **Initial Feature Set (10/30/2025, 1:25:45 PM):** The file was introduced with functions `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking system requirements like root user, kernel, filesystem encryption, and TPM), `enableIntegrity` (for creating/decrypting FEMK and encrypting directories), `unlockEncryptedDirs` (for decrypting FEMK and unlocking directories), `newCryptoKey` (for creating and securely wiping keys), and `ensureDirectoriesExist`. An incomplete `getCryptoKey` function was also present.
- **Lazy Key Loading Refinement (10/30/2025, 1:26:24 PM - 1:44:06 PM):** The `getCryptoKey` function underwent significant iterative development.
    - Its signature was updated to return `(*fscrypto.Key, ExitCode, error)` (1:26:24 PM).
    - Logic was added to check if `state.fsKey` is already loaded, returning it if so (1:26:39 PM).
    - Key decryption and creation were moved into `getCryptoKey`, and the resulting key was stored in `state.fsKey` for reuse (1:28:24 PM, 1:40:28 PM).
    - Error handling within `getCryptoKey` was progressively corrected to match its new return signature (1:40:55 PM, 1:43:47 PM).
    - A final return statement was added to complete the lazy-loading pattern (1:44:06 PM).
- **Function Refactoring (10/30/2025, 1:29:08 PM - 1:37:48 PM):** The `unlockEncryptedDirs` and `enableIntegrity` functions were refactored to utilize the evolving `getCryptoKey` for key retrieval, eliminating redundant key decryption and wiping logic previously present in these functions. This significantly streamlined their implementations. Logging for "Enabling Config Integrity..." was added to `enableIntegrity`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

-   **Concentrated Development:** All recorded changes occurred on 10/30/2025, within a concise timeframe, indicating an active development or debugging session.
-   **Security-First Design:** A clear and consistent theme is the strong emphasis on security, particularly with `fscrypto` for encryption, TPM integration for key protection, and explicit memory wiping (`fsKey.Wipe()`, zeroing out byte slices) to prevent key leakage.
-   **Lazy Loading for Keys:** The extensive iteration on `getCryptoKey` and its integration into other functions highlights a pattern of implementing lazy-loading for cryptographic keys, ensuring keys are only decrypted and instantiated when needed, and then cached within `appState`.
-   **Robust Error Handling:** The code consistently uses custom `ExitCode` values and `fmt.Errorf` with wrapped errors, along with `log.Errorf` for detailed error reporting, demonstrating a focus on robust error management.
-   **"TODO" Comments:** Throughout the code, "TODO" comments indicate areas for future work, such as context plumbing, command-line argument parsing, and advanced manifest processing.

## 4:19:24 PM
The code changes primarily involve two Go files: `state.go`, defining the application's state, and `integrity.go`, implementing core integrity and encryption logic, with a single entry for `main.go`. All changes occurred on **October 30, 2025**, within a span of approximately 25 minutes.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/state.go`**

*   **1:19:46 PM - 1:20:01 PM:** The initial `appState` structure, containing `path`, `tpmHandle`, and `fsKey`, was defined. A critical update at 1:20:01 PM added the `fscrypto "github.com/google/fscrypt/crypto"` import, resolving the type for `fsKey`.
*   **1:20:22 PM:** A comment was added to `appState` indicating `tpmHandle` and `fsKey` are "lazy-loaded variables."
*   **1:20:42 PM - 1:22:23 PM:** The `closeAppState` function underwent significant evolution. Initially, it handled closing the `tpmHandle`. Subsequently, its focus shifted to securely wiping the `fsKey` memory, first using `Clear()`, then `Wipe()` with error logging. The logic for closing the `tpmHandle` was removed during this transition.
*   **1:20:59 PM:** The `newAppState` function was updated to explicitly initialize `fsKey` as `nil`.
*   **1:44:27 PM:** The `log "github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log"` import was added, making the error logging calls within `closeAppState` valid.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**

*   **1:22:51 PM:** This single entry defines the application's entry point and overall flow. It sets up logging, defines `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised), and specifies various application-related directory paths (e.g., `/opt/128technology/integrity`, `/boot/femk.enc`). The `main` function orchestrates the `run` function, which in turn verifies the environment, enables integrity, and unlocks encrypted directories, ensuring proper cleanup via `defer closeAppState`.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**

*   **1:25:45 PM:** The file was introduced with functions for environment verification (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), enabling integrity (`enableIntegrity`), unlocking encrypted directories (`unlockEncryptedDirs`), creating cryptographic keys (`newCryptoKey`), and ensuring necessary directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`). It performs checks for root privileges, kernel version, fscrypt support, and TPM initialization.
*   **1:26:24 PM - 1:26:39 PM:** The signature of `getCryptoKey` was updated to include `ExitCode` in its return, although the function's implementation remained incomplete regarding successful returns.
*   **1:28:24 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function was intended to lazy-load `state.fsKey` but initially used a redeclaration (`:=`) instead of assignment (`=`), creating a local variable.
*   **1:29:08 PM - 1:30:12 PM:** The `unlockEncryptedDirs` function was refactored to use `getCryptoKey`. However, an initial implementation contained redundant key decryption/creation logic as a fallback if `getCryptoKey` returned an error.
*   **1:30:44 PM:** The redundant key decryption logic in `unlockEncryptedDirs` was removed, streamlining error handling for `getCryptoKey`.
*   **1:31:09 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function still had the local variable redeclaration issue for `state.fsKey`.
*   **1:37:48 PM:** The `enableIntegrity` function was updated to leverage `getCryptoKey` for key acquisition and included an informational log message.
*   **1:40:28 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function was corrected to properly assign the created key to `state.fsKey` (`state.fsKey = key`).
*   **1:40:55 PM:** The `defer` block for key wiping was removed from `getCryptoKey`, as the key is now stored in `appState` and managed by `closeAppState`.
*   **1:43:47 PM - 1:44:06 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function's error return values were made consistent, and finally, a successful return statement (`return state.fsKey, ExitSuccess, nil`) was added, completing its implementation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security Focus:** The codebase consistently addresses security, particularly filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and hardware-backed integrity using TPM, evident in key wiping, environment checks, and the explicit handling of integrity violations.
*   **State Management:** The `appState` struct serves as a central hub for application-wide objects, with `newAppState` for initialization and `closeAppState` for resource cleanup.
*   **Error Handling:** A strong emphasis on robust error handling is seen through the pervasive use of `fmt.Errorf` to wrap errors and specific `ExitCode` values for different failure types.
*   **Logging:** The `log` package is widely used for debugging, warnings, and error reporting, with `log.Debug`, `log.Warnf`, `log.Errorf`, and `log.Infof` calls sprinkled throughout.
*   **"TODO" Comments:** Numerous "TODO" comments indicate areas of ongoing development, potential improvements, or known limitations, suggesting an active development phase.
*   **Copyright:** All files include the standard Juniper Networks copyright notice.

## 5:19:30 PM
This log details a focused series of changes to the Integrity Handler application written in Go, primarily revolving around state management, environment verification, and cryptographic key handling. All modifications occurred on **October 30, 2025**, within a brief period between **1:19 PM and 1:44 PM**, indicating active development or a targeted refactoring session.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/state.go`**
    *   **Early Changes (1:19 PM - 1:20 PM)**: The `appState` struct, which holds common application objects, was initially defined with `path` and `tpmHandle`. It was quickly expanded to include `fsKey *fscrypto.Key`, along with the necessary import for `github.com/google/fscrypt/crypto`. A comment clarified `tpmHandle` as a lazy-loaded variable.
    *   **Mid-Period Changes (1:20 PM - 1:22 PM)**: A `closeAppState` function was introduced to manage application resource cleanup. Initially, it included logic for closing the TPM handle. This quickly evolved, with the TPM closing logic removed, and focus shifting to securely wiping the `fsKey` memory using `state.fsKey.Clear()` and then `state.fsKey.Wipe()`, adding robust error logging (`log.Errorf`) for failed wipe operations. The `fsKey` was also explicitly initialized to `nil` in `newAppState`.
    *   **Late Change (1:44 PM)**: An import for the custom logging package `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` was added, making the error logging in `closeAppState` functional.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Single Entry (1:22 PM)**: This file defines the application's entry point (`main` function) and core execution flow (`run` function). It establishes standard `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) and defines constants for key directories (`/opt/128technology/integrity`, `/boot/femk.enc`). The `run` function orchestrates environmental verification (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), state initialization (`newAppState`, `defer closeAppState`), and the main integrity operations (`enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`). It also incorporates versioning using `go:embed`.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial Structure (1:25 PM)**: This file laid out the extensive logic for integrity management. It included `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` to check for root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` utility availability, and TPM initialization (`tpm.InitializeTPM`). Functions `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` were defined to handle FEMK (File Encryption Master Key) resolution, creation, decryption, and secure wiping, along with filesystem encryption actions. A helper `newCryptoKey` function was present for key creation and immediate wiping of input data.
    *   **`getCryptoKey` Development (1:26 PM - 1:44 PM)**: A significant portion of the changes in this file involved the iterative development and refinement of the `getCryptoKey` function.
        *   Its signature evolved from `(*fscrypto.Key, error)` to `(*fscrypto.Key, ExitCode, error)` to accommodate more detailed error reporting.
        *   Logic was added for lazy-loading and caching the `fsKey` in the `appState`.
        *   **Refactoring and Corrections**: `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` were refactored to utilize `getCryptoKey` for key retrieval, removing redundant key decryption/creation logic. Several commits addressed logical issues within `getCryptoKey`, such as variable shadowing (`state.fsKey, err := newCryptoKey(plainKey)`) and incomplete return paths for error and success cases. The error returns were also adjusted multiple times to ensure the correct `ExitCode` was paired with the `error`.
        *   **Final Implementation**: The `getCryptoKey` function was ultimately completed at **1:44 PM**, correctly lazy-loading the `fsKey`, handling various error conditions (e.g., `decryptFEMK` failure, `newCryptoKey` failure), and returning the `*fscrypto.Key`, `ExitCode`, and `error` appropriately.
    *   **Logging Update (1:37 PM)**: A `log.Info("Enabling Config Integrity...")` message was added to the `enableIntegrity` function.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Timestamp Concentration**: All changes are tightly grouped on a single date, suggesting a dedicated development phase.
*   **Copyright**: All files share the same Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025.
*   **Core Application Focus**: All code is part of the `main` package for an "Integrity Handler application," implying a single, self-contained executable.
*   **Security Best Practices**:
    *   **Key Wiping**: A strong emphasis on securely wiping cryptographic keys from memory (`key.Wipe()`) is evident, often using `defer` statements to ensure execution even on error.
    *   **Root Requirement**: The `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` explicitly checks for root privileges, highlighting a security-critical operation.
*   **TPM Integration**: The application interacts with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) via `github.com/google/go-tpm/tpmutil` and a local `tpm` package for secure key handling (`tpm.InitializeTPM`, `tpm.CloseTPMHandle`).
*   **Filesystem Encryption**: Heavy reliance on `github.com/google/fscrypt` for managing encrypted directories (`fscrypt.EncryptTargetDirs`, `fscrypt.UnlockEncryptedDirs`).
*   **Structured Error Handling**: Functions consistently return `ExitCode` and `error` values, allowing for detailed control over application termination states.
*   **Lazy Initialization**: The `fsKey` in `appState` is explicitly designed for lazy-loading to optimize resource usage.
*   **TODO Comments**: The presence of numerous `TODO` comments throughout the code indicates ongoing development or planned future enhancements, such as manifest processing, command-line argument parsing, and further context integration.

## 6:19:27 PM
The code change log primarily details the development of an "Integrity Handler" application in Go, focusing on file encryption and integrity verification, likely leveraging TPM (Trusted Platform Module) and fscrypt. All changes occurred on 10/30/2025, within a short timeframe (1:19 PM to 1:44 PM), indicating rapid development or a single concentrated session.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/state.go`
This file defines the `appState` structure and its associated lifecycle functions.
- **10/30/2025, 1:19:46 PM - 1:20:01 PM:** The `appState` struct was initially defined with `path` and `tpmHandle`. Shortly after, a `fscrypto.Key` field (`fsKey`) was added, alongside its import, to manage file system encryption keys.
- **10/30/2025, 1:20:22 PM:** A comment `// lazy-loaded variables:` was added to clarify the nature of `tpmHandle` and `fsKey`.
- **10/30/2025, 1:20:42 PM - 1:20:59 PM:** The `closeAppState` function was introduced to handle resource cleanup. Initially, it included logic to close the TPM handle. The `newAppState` function was updated to initialize `fsKey` to `nil`.
- **10/30/2025, 1:21:24 PM - 1:22:23 PM:** The `closeAppState` function underwent significant refactoring. The TPM closing logic was removed, and the focus shifted to securely wiping the `fsKey` memory using `state.fsKey.Clear()` and then `state.fsKey.Wipe()`. Error logging was added for key wiping, with a minor adjustment to log messages.
- **10/30/2025, 1:44:27 PM:** A `log` package import was added, consolidating logging functionalities.

#### `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`
This file serves as the application's entry point and orchestrator.
- **10/30/2025, 1:22:51 PM:** This initial and sole entry defines the core execution flow. It imports various packages, including `log` and `context`, and sets up `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised). It also defines application-specific directory paths (`/opt/128technology/integrity`, etc.) and the `encryptedKeyPath`. The `main` function sets up logging and calls the `run` function, which performs environmental verification, enables integrity, and unlocks encrypted directories, deferring `closeAppState` for cleanup. Several `TODO` comments highlight future work, such as context plumbing and command-line argument parsing.

#### `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`
This file contains the core logic for environmental checks, enabling file system integrity, and managing encryption keys.
- **10/30/2025, 1:25:45 PM:** The initial implementation established functions for `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root, kernel version, fscrypt support, TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (creating/decrypting FEMK, encrypting target directories), `unlockEncryptedDirs` (decrypting FEMK, unlocking directories), and helper functions `newCryptoKey` and `ensureDirectoriesExist`. Extensive `TODO` comments were present, particularly regarding key management and processing manifests.
- **10/30/2025, 1:26:24 PM - 1:26:39 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function's signature was changed to return an `ExitCode` along with the key and error. Initial attempts were made to implement its logic, including a placeholder return for `ExitSuccess`.
- **10/30/2025, 1:28:24 PM:** The `getCryptoKey` function was updated to store the newly created `crypto.Key` into `state.fsKey` for lazy-loading.
- **10/30/2025, 1:29:08 PM - 1:30:12 PM:** A temporary regression occurred in `unlockEncryptedDirs`, where it incorrectly re-implemented key decryption/creation logic within an error handling block after calling `getCryptoKey`.
- **10/30/2025, 1:30:44 PM - 1:31:09 PM:** The `unlockEncryptedDirs` function was corrected to properly use the `getCryptoKey` output, removing redundant decryption logic. Debug log statements for `plainKey` were removed from both `unlockEncryptedDirs` and `getCryptoKey`.
- **10/30/2025, 1:37:48 PM:** The `enableIntegrity` function was refactored to utilize `getCryptoKey`, streamlining key retrieval. An informational log message was added at the start of `enableIntegrity`.
- **10/30/2025, 1:40:28 PM - 1:44:06 PM:** Final refinements to `getCryptoKey` were made, ensuring it correctly assigns `state.fsKey` upon successful creation and returns the key, `ExitSuccess`, and `nil` error as per its updated signature. Error returns were also made consistent to return `nil` for `*fscrypto.Key` on failure.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Application State Management:** The `appState` struct in `state.go` is central to managing shared resources (`tpmHandle`, `fsKey`) across the application. The `newAppState` and `closeAppState` functions consistently handle initialization and cleanup, emphasizing resource release and secure memory wiping for cryptographic keys.
2.  **Security Focus:** There's a strong emphasis on security, particularly around cryptographic key handling. Functions like `newCryptoKey` explicitly wipe input key bytes after use, and `closeAppState` now prioritizes wiping `fsKey` memory. Integrity violation (`ExitCompromised`) is a distinct exit code.
3.  **Environmental Pre-checks:** The `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` function systematically checks for system requirements, including root privileges, kernel version, fscrypt support, and TPM initialization, ensuring the environment is suitable for integrity operations.
4.  **Modular Functions:** The code is structured with distinct functions for specific tasks (e.g., `createFEMK`, `decryptFEMK`, `newCryptoKey`, `ensureDirectoriesExist`, `EncryptTargetDirs`, `UnlockEncryptedDirs`), promoting readability and maintainability.
5.  **Logging and Error Handling:** Extensive use of `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Errorf`, and detailed error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`) provides good observability and traceable error propagation.
6.  **Refactoring and Iterative Improvement:** The changes, especially in `integrity.go` and `state.go`, show an iterative development process, with functions being introduced, then refactored for better state management (`getCryptoKey`) or enhanced security (`closeAppState`).
7.  **`TODO` Comments:** Numerous `TODO` comments are present, indicating areas for future work, improvements, or further considerations, particularly regarding manifest processing, context handling, and command-line arguments.

## 7:19:27 PM
This log details rapid development over approximately 25 minutes on October 30, 2025, for a Go application named "Integrity Handler" by Juniper Networks, Inc., focused on file integrity and encryption using TPM and fscrypt.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/state.go`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 1:19:46 PM - 1:44:27 PM
    *   The `appState` struct, which holds common application objects, was expanded. Initially, it contained `path` and `tpmHandle`.
    *   A `fsKey *fscrypto.Key` field was added to `appState` for managing cryptographic keys, imported from `github.com/google/fscrypt/crypto`.
    *   Comments were added to mark `tpmHandle` and `fsKey` as "lazy-loaded variables".
    *   A `closeAppState` function was introduced, evolving significantly over several commits:
        *   Initially, it included logic to close the `tpmHandle`.
        *   It then shifted focus to securely wiping the `fsKey` using `state.fsKey.Clear()` and later `state.fsKey.Wipe()`, with error logging for failed key wiping.
        *   An explicit `log` package import was added (`"github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log"`) to support error logging within `closeAppState`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 1:22:51 PM
    *   This file defines the main entry point and overall structure of the Integrity Handler.
    *   It imports necessary packages for context, embedding, formatting, OS interaction, and logging.
    *   Custom `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) are defined for process return values.
    *   Key directory paths (`baseDirPath`, `migrationDirPath`, `manifestDirPath`, `encryptedKeyPath`) are defined as constants.
    *   The `main` function initializes logging and calls the core `run` function, handling exit codes and errors.
    *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: it gets the version, initializes `appState`, calls `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` for system checks, then `enableIntegrity` to set up encryption, and finally `unlockEncryptedDirs` to access encrypted directories.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 1:25:45 PM - 1:44:06 PM
    *   This file contains the core logic for verifying the environment and managing filesystem encryption.
    *   **`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`**: Checks if the process runs as root, kernel version is at least 5.4, the filesystem supports encryption (via `fscrypt` context), the `fscrypt` command is installed, and the TPM is initialized.
    *   **`enableIntegrity`**: Responsible for creating/resolving the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, ensuring necessary directories exist, and encrypting target directories. This function was refactored to utilize `getCryptoKey` for key retrieval.
    *   **`unlockEncryptedDirs`**: Designed to decrypt the FEMK and unlock previously encrypted directories. This function also underwent a significant refactoring to use `getCryptoKey`.
    *   **`getCryptoKey`**: This function was the subject of numerous iterative changes, focusing on lazy-loading the cryptographic key into `appState.fsKey` and ensuring correct error handling and return types (`*fscrypto.Key, ExitCode, error`). The logic for decrypting the FEMK (`decryptFEMK`) and creating a new crypto key (`newCryptoKey`) was consolidated here. Initial attempts at key wiping within this function were removed as the key is now stored in the application state and is expected to be wiped by `closeAppState`.
    *   **`newCryptoKey`**: Creates a new `fscrypto.Key` from input bytes, explicitly zeroing out the input byte slice for security.
    *   **`ensureDirectoriesExist`**: Ensures application-specific directories (`migrationDirPath`, `manifestDirPath`) are created with appropriate permissions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Rapid Development Cycle:** All changes occurred within a concentrated 25-minute period on the same day, indicating an active debugging or feature implementation session.
*   **Security Focus:** A strong emphasis is placed on cryptographic key handling, including the use of `fscrypto.Key` for secure key storage and explicit attempts to wipe key material from memory (e.g., `state.fsKey.Wipe()`, zeroing `inputKey`). This highlights a concern for preventing sensitive data leaks.
*   **TPM and Fscrypt Integration:** The application extensively leverages Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for key management (`tpm.InitializeTPM`, `tpm.CloseTPMHandle`) and `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption actions (`fscrypt.SetupOnMount`, `fscrypt.EncryptTargetDirs`, `fscrypt.UnlockEncryptedDirs`).
*   **Error Management:** A consistent pattern of detailed error reporting using `log.Errorf` and structured error returns (including custom `ExitCode` enums) is present across the codebase.
*   **Lazy Loading of Resources:** Both the TPM handle and the filesystem cryptographic key are designed to be "lazy-loaded" into the `appState` to manage their lifecycle efficiently.
*   **Code Comments:** Extensive `TODO` comments indicate ongoing work, planned features (e.g., command line argument parsing, context plumbing, manifest processing), and areas requiring further attention, particularly around secure key management and error handling during setup.
