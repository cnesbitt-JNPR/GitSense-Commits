# Activity Summary for 10/31/2025

## 12:19:23 AM
The provided log details a series of rapid code changes to a Go application named "Integrity Handler," primarily focused on secure filesystem encryption using TPM and `fscrypt`. The changes occurred in a concentrated period on October 30, 2025, between 1:19 PM and 1:44 PM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/state.go:** This file defines the `appState` struct, which holds application-wide objects like the filesystem encryption key (`fsKey`) and TPM handle (`tpmHandle`).
    *   **Early Changes (1:19:46 PM - 1:20:22 PM):** The initial `appState` struct was defined, followed by the crucial import of `github.com/google/fscrypt/crypto` to properly type `fsKey`. Comments were added to mark `tpmHandle` and `fsKey` as lazy-loaded.
    *   **Lifecycle Management (1:20:42 PM - 1:22:23 PM):** A `closeAppState` function was progressively introduced and refined. Initially, it handled closing the TPM handle. It quickly evolved to include a mechanism to securely wipe the `fsKey` memory using `state.fsKey.Clear()` (1:21:24 PM), which was then changed to `state.fsKey.Wipe()` with error logging for memory wiping failures (1:22:16 PM).
    *   **Dependency Resolution (1:44:27 PM):** The `log` package from `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` was explicitly imported to support the error logging in `closeAppState`.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go:** This file contains the main entry point and orchestrates the integrity handling process.
    *   **Initial Setup (1:22:51 PM):** The single entry for this file indicates the primary structure was established. It defines `ExitCode` constants, embeds a version string, specifies directory paths (`/opt/128technology/integrity`, `/boot/femk.enc`), and sets up logging. The `run` function outlines the application's flow: verifying the environment, enabling integrity, and unlocking encrypted directories. It properly defers `closeAppState` to ensure resources are cleaned up.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go:** This file houses the core logic for verifying the environment, enabling encryption, and unlocking encrypted directories.
    *   **Core Functions Introduced (1:25:45 PM):** Key functions `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getCryptoKey`, `newCryptoKey`, and `ensureDirectoriesExist` were initially committed. This established checks for root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` utility presence, and TPM initialization. It also introduced key creation, decryption, and directory encryption/unlocking mechanisms, including `defer` calls to wipe key memory after use.
    *   **Refinement of `getCryptoKey` (1:26:24 PM - 1:44:06 PM):** A significant series of changes revolved around the `getCryptoKey` function, which is designed for lazy-loading the `fscrypto.Key` into the `appState`.
        *   Its return signature was updated to include `ExitCode` (1:26:24 PM).
        *   The logic to store the newly created key in `state.fsKey` was corrected (from `state.fsKey, err := ...` to `key, err := ...; state.fsKey = key`) to correctly update the struct field (1:28:24 PM, further refined at 1:40:28 PM).
        *   Error handling for various failure paths within `getCryptoKey` was improved, ensuring correct `nil` returns for the key on error (1:43:47 PM).
        *   Finally, the complete success path, including `return state.fsKey, ExitSuccess, nil`, was added (1:44:06 PM), making the function robust.
    *   **Integration of `getCryptoKey` (1:29:08 PM - 1:37:48 PM):** Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` were modified to leverage the `getCryptoKey` function, simplifying their internal logic by abstracting key retrieval. This involved removing redundant key decryption and creation blocks (e.g., in `unlockEncryptedDirs` at 1:30:44 PM) and streamlining the error handling.
    *   **Logging Updates (1:37:48 PM):** An informational log (`log.Info("Enabling Config Integrity...")`) was added to `enableIntegrity`. Debug logs related to decrypted key display were also consistently added and then marked for removal with `TODO` comments across several commits, indicating active debugging during development.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security Focus:** A strong emphasis on security is evident through the use of TPM (`tpmutil`), filesystem encryption (`fscrypto`), and explicit key memory wiping (`key.Wipe()`) using `defer` statements to prevent key remnants. Potential integrity violations are explicitly handled as `ExitCompromised`.
*   **Structured Error Handling:** Go's multi-value return for errors is consistently used, often including a custom `ExitCode`. Extensive logging (`log.Errorf`, `log.Debug`) is present throughout for diagnostics.
*   **Lazy Loading:** The `appState` struct's `tpmHandle` and `fsKey` are explicitly designed for lazy loading, and `getCryptoKey` implements this pattern for the `fsKey`.
*   **Development Indicators:** Numerous `TODO` comments (e.g., regarding contexts, command-line arguments, manifest processing, debug log removal) indicate that the codebase is actively under development.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The very close timestamps across multiple changes within `state.go` and `integrity.go` suggest a continuous and iterative development process, quickly adding features, refactoring, and fixing issues in short bursts.
*   **Copyright and Package Structure:** All files maintain a consistent copyright notice and are part of the `main` package, following standard Go project conventions.

## 1:19:19 AM
This log details a rapid series of changes across three Go files (`state.go`, `main.go`, `integrity.go`) for an "Integrity Handler" application, all occurring on October 30, 2025, between 1:19 PM and 1:44 PM. The changes primarily focus on setting up and refining core integrity and encryption functionalities, particularly around key management and environment verification.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/state.go`**
This file defines the `appState` struct, which holds common objects for the application, including a `path`, a `tpmHandle` (for TPM interactions), and an `fsKey` (for filesystem encryption).
*   **Initial setup (1:19:46 PM):** The `appState` struct and its constructor `newAppState` were introduced, containing `path` and `tpmHandle`.
*   **Key Management Integration (1:20:01 PM - 1:21:24 PM):**
    *   `fscrypto` import was added, and `fsKey *fscrypto.Key` was introduced to `appState` to manage cryptographic keys.
    *   A `closeAppState` function was introduced and iteratively refined. Initially, it handled closing the `tpmHandle`. It was then updated to manage the `fsKey`, first by calling `state.fsKey.Clear()` and later `state.fsKey.Wipe()` (1:22:16 PM) to securely clear key memory, adding error logging for the wipe operation.
*   **Final change (1:44:27 PM):** Added `log` package import.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
This file outlines the main execution flow of the Integrity Handler application.
*   **Initial implementation (1:22:51 PM):**
    *   Defines `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) for standardized process return values.
    *   Includes constants for base directories (`baseDirPath`, `migrationDirPath`, `manifestDirPath`) and the `encryptedKeyPath`.
    *   The `main` function initializes logging, calls the `run` function, and handles its exit code.
    *   The `run` function details the application's lifecycle: getting the version, initializing an `appState`, deferring its closure, verifying the environment (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), enabling integrity (`enableIntegrity`), and unlocking encrypted directories (`unlockEncryptedDirs`). It includes `TODO` comments for future enhancements like command-line argument parsing.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
This file contains the core logic for environmental checks, enabling filesystem integrity, and unlocking encrypted data.
*   **Initial functions (1:25:45 PM):** Introduced `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `newCryptoKey`, and `ensureDirectoriesExist`.
    *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` validates system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), fscrypt support, and TPM initialization.
    *   `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` included logic to create/decrypt a File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), create a `fscrypto.Key`, ensure necessary directories exist, set up `fscrypt` on the mount, and either encrypt or unlock target directories. Both functions had explicit `defer` statements to wipe key memory.
    *   A `getCryptoKey` function was present but incomplete, intended for lazy-loading the cryptographic key.
*   **Refinement of `getCryptoKey` and Key Handling (1:26:24 PM - 1:44:06 PM):**
    *   The signature of `getCryptoKey` was updated multiple times to consistently return `(*fscrypto.Key, ExitCode, error)` (1:26:24 PM).
    *   Efforts were made to integrate `getCryptoKey` into `unlockEncryptedDirs` (1:29:08 PM) and `enableIntegrity` (1:37:48 PM) to centralize key retrieval and lazy-load the key into the `appState`. This involved several iterations to correctly handle local variable scope, proper assignment to `state.fsKey`, and comprehensive return values for error conditions.
    *   Debug logging for decrypted keys (`log.Debugf("Decrypted key: 0x%x", plainKey)`) was moved and adjusted throughout these functions.
    *   The `getCryptoKey` function was fully completed by 1:44:06 PM to correctly lazy-load `state.fsKey` and return it along with appropriate `ExitCode` and error.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Security Focus:** The codebase consistently addresses integrity, encryption, and secure key handling (e.g., `fscrypt`, `go-tpm`, `fscrypto`, `Wipe()` operations).
*   **Error Handling:** A standard pattern of returning custom `ExitCode` alongside `error` is used for application-level outcomes. Errors are often wrapped using `fmt.Errorf("%w", err)`.
*   **Logging:** Extensive use of `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warn`, and `log.Errorf` indicates a strong emphasis on observability and debugging.
*   **Copyright:** All files include the Juniper Networks copyright for 2025.
*   **Modularization:** Functions like `newCryptoKey` and `ensureDirectoriesExist` are small, focused, and reusable.
*   **Active Development:** The presence of numerous `TODO` comments indicates the project is actively under development, with planned future improvements or considerations. The rapid succession of timestamps suggests focused work on a particular feature or bug fix.

## 3:19:26 AM
The provided log details changes to an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, specifically concerning the management of application state and integrity-related cryptographic operations. All timestamps are on 10/30/2025, indicating a concentrated development session.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/state.go`**
    *   **Initial Setup (1:19:46 PM - 1:20:01 PM):** The `appState` struct was introduced to hold common application objects, initially with `path` and `tpmHandle`. Shortly after, a `fscrypto.Key` (aliased as `fsKey`) was added, and the necessary `fscrypto` import was included.
    *   **Struct Refinements & Cleanup (1:20:22 PM - 1:22:23 PM):** A comment `// lazy-loaded variables:` was added to clarify `tpmHandle` and `fsKey`'s purpose. A `closeAppState` function was introduced, initially to handle TPM handle closure. This function then evolved to manage the secure wiping of the `fsKey` by changing from `key.Clear()` to `key.Wipe()`, adding `log.Errorf` for failure, and removing a `log.Debug("Exiting anyway...")` statement.
    *   **Dependency Addition (1:44:27 PM):** The `log` package from `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` was explicitly imported, required by the error logging in `closeAppState`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Application Entry Point (1:22:51 PM):** This file, with a single log entry, defines the `main` function and core application flow. It sets up logging, defines `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`), embeds version information, and specifies key directory paths (`/opt/128technology/integrity` related paths, `/boot/femk.enc`). The `run` function orchestrates environment verification, integrity enabling, and unlocking of encrypted directories, using `newAppState` and `defer closeAppState`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial Implementation & Environment Checks (1:25:45 PM):** This extensive initial commit established functions for `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getCryptoKey`, `newCryptoKey`, and `ensureDirectoriesExist`. Key management, including decryption and memory wiping (`key.Wipe()`), was a prominent feature. The initial `getCryptoKey` function was incomplete, lacking a proper return.
    *   **Refactoring `getCryptoKey` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` (1:26:24 PM - 1:31:09 PM):**
        *   The signature of `getCryptoKey` was updated to `(*fscrypto.Key, ExitCode, error)`.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs` was refactored to utilize `getCryptoKey` for obtaining the key, moving away from redundant direct decryption and key creation logic. The previous `defer key.Wipe()` and debug logging were removed from `unlockEncryptedDirs` as `getCryptoKey` was intended to handle the key lifecycle and lazy loading.
        *   During these iterations, the `getCryptoKey` function remained functionally incomplete, particularly on its success path, leading to multiple subsequent fixes.
    *   **Enhancements and Final `getCryptoKey` Fix (1:37:48 PM - 1:44:06 PM):**
        *   `enableIntegrity` was also refactored to use the (still being corrected) `getCryptoKey` function, simplifying its internal logic for key acquisition.
        *   A `log.Info` message "Enabling Config Integrity..." was added.
        *   The `getCryptoKey` function underwent several critical fixes:
            *   It was updated to correctly assign the newly created `fscrypto.Key` to `state.fsKey` when decrypting (`state.fsKey, err := newCryptoKey(plainKey)`).
            *   Its error returns were completed to return `nil` for the `*fscrypto.Key` in failure scenarios.
            *   Finally, at **1:44:06 PM**, `getCryptoKey` was completed with a `return state.fsKey, ExitSuccess, nil` for its successful execution path, resolving a long-standing issue in its implementation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice:** All files consistently include the copyright `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Integrity-Focused Logic:** The code revolves around establishing and maintaining system integrity through environment verification, TPM interaction, and filesystem encryption using `fscrypt`.
*   **Key Management:** A central theme is the secure handling of the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), including decryption, creation of `fscrypto.Key` objects, and memory wiping, often using `defer` statements.
*   **Lazy Loading:** The `fsKey` within `appState` is designed for lazy loading via the `getCryptoKey` function to optimize resource usage.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Functions consistently return multiple values (`ExitCode`, `error`) and use `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)` for error wrapping, providing detailed context for failures. Specific `ExitCode` values differentiate between success, generic failure, incompatible environments, and integrity violations.
*   **Logging:** Extensive use of `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warnf`, and `log.Errorf` statements for operational tracing and error reporting.
*   **TODO Comments:** Numerous `// TODO` comments indicate ongoing development, future features (e.g., manifest processing, command-line arguments), or areas requiring further consideration (e.g., context plumbing, key reuse, specific error handling scenarios).

## 4:19:24 AM
This log details a rapid series of changes to the "Integrity Handler" Go application, all occurring on October 30, 2025, between 1:19 PM and 1:44 PM, suggesting a focused development or refactoring session.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/state.go:**
    *   **Initial Setup (1:19:46 PM):** The `appState` struct was defined, containing `path` and `tpmHandle`. A `newAppState` function was introduced for initialization.
    *   **Key Management Integration (1:20:01 PM - 1:20:59 PM):** The file was updated to import `github.com/google/fscrypt/crypto` (aliased as `fscrypto`), and `fsKey *fscrypto.Key` was added to the `appState` struct. Comments were added to mark `tpmHandle` and `fsKey` as lazy-loaded.
    *   **Resource Cleanup (`closeAppState`) Development (1:20:42 PM - 1:22:23 PM):** A `closeAppState` function was introduced. Initially, it handled closing `tpmHandle`. It was then refined to specifically manage the `fsKey`, first calling `Clear()` and then `Wipe()` on the key to securely erase its memory, adding error logging for `Wipe()` failures.
    *   **Logging Dependency (1:44:27 PM):** The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package was explicitly imported to support the logging calls added to `closeAppState`.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go:**
    *   **Core Application Logic (1:22:51 PM):** This file, introduced in a single entry, establishes the main execution flow of the Integrity Handler. It defines `ExitCode` constants, embeds a version string, specifies key directory paths (e.g., `/opt/128technology/integrity`, `/boot/femk.enc`), and sets up logging. The `run` function orchestrates environment verification (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), integrity enablement (`enableIntegrity`), and encrypted directory unlocking (`unlockEncryptedDirs`), utilizing `appState` and deferring `closeAppState`.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go:**
    *   **Initial Integrity Logic (1:25:45 PM):** This file started with core integrity functions. `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` checks system prerequisites (root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command, TPM initialization). `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` both contained logic for decrypting a File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), creating a secure `fscrypto.Key`, and ensuring key memory is wiped (`defer key.Wipe()`). An incomplete `getCryptoKey` function was also present, intended for lazy-loading keys.
    *   **Refactoring `getCryptoKey` and Key Lifecycle (1:26:24 PM - 1:44:06 PM):**
        *   The signature of `getCryptoKey` was adjusted to return `(*fscrypto.Key, ExitCode, error)` (1:26:24 PM).
        *   An attempt to store the key in `state.fsKey` within `getCryptoKey` was introduced (1:28:24 PM), though initially incorrectly using a local variable declaration (`:=`).
        *   The `unlockEncryptedDirs` function was refactored to utilize `getCryptoKey`, initially with redundant fallback logic (1:29:08 PM - 1:30:12 PM), which was then cleaned up (1:30:44 PM).
        *   `enableIntegrity` was also updated to use `getCryptoKey` for key retrieval, removing its duplicate key creation and wiping logic (1:37:48 PM).
        *   The variable shadowing issue in `getCryptoKey` was resolved (1:40:28 PM), and debug logging related to plain keys was moved into this function.
        *   The return paths for `getCryptoKey` were progressively fixed, explicitly returning `nil` for `*fscrypto.Key` on error (1:43:47 PM).
        *   Finally, a complete return statement was added to `getCryptoKey` (1:44:06 PM), ensuring it always returns the loaded key, success code, and nil error when successful.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Package Declarations:** All Go files consistently feature a Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025 and declare `package main`.
*   **Modular Design:** The application is divided into `main.go`, `state.go`, and `integrity.go`, handling application entry/flow, shared state management, and core integrity/encryption logic, respectively.
*   **Security Focus:** A strong emphasis on security is evident through the use of TPM (`tpmutil`, local `tpm` package) for key protection, `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, and explicit `Wipe()` operations on `fscrypto.Key` objects to clear sensitive key material from memory. Error conditions often lead to `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.
*   **Error Handling and Exit Codes:** Go's error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`) is used extensively. The application defines specific `ExitCode` values to indicate different types of success or failure.
*   **Logging:** A custom `log` package is widely used for debugging, informational messages, warnings, and errors throughout the codebase, providing clear diagnostic output.
*   **"TODO" Comments:** Numerous "TODO" comments indicate areas for future development, refinement, or consideration (e.g., context plumbing, command-line parsing, manifest processing, key reuse).
*   **Lazy-loading:** The `tpmHandle` and `fsKey` in `appState` are explicitly designed for lazy-loading to optimize resource utilization.

## 5:19:31 AM
The provided log details a concentrated development session on October 30, 2025, focused on enhancing the "Integrity Handler" application, primarily in its state management, key handling, and integrity functions.

**File-Specific Updates:**

    *   **Timestamp Range:** 10/30/2025, 1:19:46 PM - 1:44:27 PM
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   Initializes the `appState` struct, which is central for managing application state including `path`, `tpmHandle`, and `fsKey`.
        *   Introduced `fscrypto` import to properly support `fsKey`.
        *   Added a `newAppState` constructor and progressively developed a `closeAppState` function. This `closeAppState` function initially focused on closing the TPM handle, then shifted to securely wiping the `fsKey` using `state.fsKey.Clear()` and later `state.fsKey.Wipe()`, incorporating error logging for failed key wipes.
        *   The `fsKey` field in `appState` was explicitly initialized to `nil` in `newAppState`.
        *   Finally, the necessary `log` package import was added to resolve logging calls within `closeAppState`.

    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   This file outlines the main execution flow of the Integrity Handler.
        *   It defines various `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes (success, generic failure, environment incompatibility, integrity compromise).
        *   It uses `//go:embed` to include the application version.
        *   Establishes key directory paths: `/opt/128technology/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`, and `/boot/femk.enc`.
        *   The `main` function orchestrates logging, calls the `run` function, and handles the application's exit.
        *   The `run` function sets up the `appState`, verifies the environment using `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, then proceeds to `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, ensuring `closeAppState` is deferred for cleanup.

    *   **Timestamp Range:** 10/30/2025, 1:25:45 PM - 1:44:06 PM
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   **Environment Initialization:** `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was consistently present, checking for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
        *   **Key Management Refactoring:** This file saw the most significant iterative development, particularly around the `getCryptoKey` function.
            *   Initially, `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` had direct calls to `decryptFEMK` and `newCryptoKey` with deferred key-wiping logic.
            *   `getCryptoKey` was introduced to lazy-load and store `fscrypto.Key` in `appState`. Its implementation underwent multiple revisions to correctly handle error propagation and return values (`*fscrypto.Key, ExitCode, error`).
            *   There were temporary redundant decryption blocks in `unlockEncryptedDirs` and debug logging issues (`plainKey` out of scope) which were subsequently corrected.
            *   By the final entry, `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` both correctly utilize the `getCryptoKey` function to retrieve the `fscrypto.Key` from the `appState`.
        *   **Directory Management:** The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function consistently creates `migrationDirPath` and `manifestDirPath`.
        *   **Core Logic:** Functions like `createFEMK`, `decryptFEMK`, `newCryptoKey`, `fscrypt.SetupOnMount`, `fscrypt.EncryptTargetDirs`, and `fscrypt.UnlockEncryptedDirs` are central to the application's purpose of managing encrypted filesystems using a Front-End Master Key (FEMK).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **10/30/2025, 1:20:01 PM**: Import of `fscrypto` in `state.go`, enabling file encryption key management.
*   **10/30/2025, 1:21:24 PM**: Major refactor of `closeAppState` in `state.go` to focus on secure key wiping.
*   **10/30/2025, 1:22:51 PM**: Introduction of `main.go`, outlining the overall application flow and integrity checks.
*   **10/30/2025, 1:25:45 PM**: Initial comprehensive implementation of `integrity.go` with environment checks and encryption/decryption functions.
*   **10/30/2025, 1:28:24 PM - 1:44:06 PM**: A series of rapid, iterative changes to `integrity.go` to refine the `getCryptoKey` function, integrate it properly into `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, fix bugs related to key handling and logging, and finally complete its implementation.
*   **10/30/2025, 1:44:27 PM**: Addition of `log` package import in `state.go` to resolve previous logging errors.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security Focus:** A strong emphasis on secure key management is evident through the use of `fscrypto.Key`, explicit key wiping (`Wipe()`/`Clear()`) after use, and integration with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for FEMK encryption. Failures in key decryption or environment checks often result in `ExitCompromised` or `ExitIncompatible` codes, highlighting the critical nature of integrity.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Consistent use of detailed error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`) and structured logging (`log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warnf`, `log.Errorf`) for tracing execution and diagnosing issues.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** The extensive log for `integrity.go` showcases an iterative development process, especially for the `getCryptoKey` function, demonstrating repeated modifications to improve logic, correct bugs, and integrate it effectively.
*   **Copyright:** All files include the standard `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` notice.
*   **"TODO" Comments:** Numerous `// TODO` comments indicate ongoing development tasks, planned features (e.g., command line argument parsing, manifest processing, context plumbing), and areas for future optimization or clarification.
*   **Module Structure:** The application leverages external libraries (`go-tpm`, `fscrypt`, `afero`) and internal packages (`fscrypt`, `tpm` from `IntegrityHandler`) to modularize its functionality.
