# Activity Summary for 11/1/2025

## 12:19:23 AM
The changes log details the development of an Integrity Handler application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption, TPM integration, and secure key management. The updates span two primary files: `state.go` and `integrity.go`, with a single entry for `main.go`. All changes occur on **October 30, 2025**.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/state.go`**

*   **Early Changes (1:19 PM - 1:20 PM):**
    *   The `appState` struct, which holds common application objects like `path`, `tpmHandle` (TPM utility handle), and `fsKey` (fscrypt cryptographic key), was initially defined.
    *   The import for `fscrypto` was added to properly define `fsKey`.
    *   Comments were added to clarify `tpmHandle` and `fsKey` as lazy-loaded variables.
*   **Key Management Refinements (1:20 PM - 1:22 PM):**
    *   A `closeAppState` function was introduced (1:20:42 PM) to handle cleanup, initially focused on closing the `tpmHandle`.
    *   `newAppState` was updated to explicitly initialize `fsKey` to `nil`.
    *   Significant changes to `closeAppState` (1:21:24 PM, 1:22:16 PM) shifted its focus from closing TPM handles to securely wiping the `fsKey` memory using `state.fsKey.Wipe()`, adding error logging for failed wipes.
*   **Final Update (1:44:27 PM):**
    *   The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package was explicitly imported, which is essential for the error logging statements in `closeAppState`.

**2. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**

*   **Single Entry (1:22:51 PM):** This file defines the core entry point and execution flow of the Integrity Handler.
    *   It imports necessary packages including `context`, `embed`, `fmt`, `os`, `strings`, and the local `log` package.
    *   It establishes `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised).
    *   It defines important filesystem paths like `/opt/128technology/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`, and the encrypted key path `/boot/femk.enc`.
    *   The `main` function initializes logging, calls the `run` function, handles its return, and exits.
    *   The `run` function orchestrates the application's main tasks: version logging, `appState` initialization and deferred cleanup, environment verification (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), enabling integrity (`enableIntegrity`), and unlocking encrypted directories (`unlockEncryptedDirs`).

**3. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**

*   **Initial Implementation (1:25:45 PM):**
    *   This file provides the bulk of the integrity logic, importing `fscrypt` related packages (`actions`, `crypto`, `util`), `afero` for filesystem operations, and local `tpm` and `log` packages.
    *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` performs critical system checks: root user, kernel version (>= 5.4), fscrypt support, and TPM initialization.
    *   `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` were introduced to handle the encryption and decryption processes, respectively. Both initially included repetitive logic for decrypting FEMK, creating `fscrypto.Key`, and ensuring memory wipe on exit.
    *   `newCryptoKey` and `ensureDirectoriesExist` helper functions were present. `getCryptoKey` was initially incomplete/buggy.
*   **Refactoring and Error Handling (1:26 PM - 1:30 PM):**
    *   Multiple small commits iteratively fixed the `getCryptoKey` function's return signature and logic (1:26:24 PM, 1:26:39 PM, 1:28:24 PM), aiming to lazy-load the `fscrypto.Key` into `appState.fsKey`.
    *   `unlockEncryptedDirs` was refactored (1:29:08 PM, 1:30:12 PM) to leverage the `getCryptoKey` function, reducing redundancy, and removed some debug logging (1:30:44 PM).
*   **Centralized Key Management (1:37 PM - 1:44 PM):**
    *   `enableIntegrity` was simplified (1:37:48 PM) to use `getCryptoKey`, removing its internal key creation and `defer key.Wipe()` logic, centralizing key lifecycle management.
    *   Further fixes to `getCryptoKey` (1:40:28 PM, 1:40:55 PM, 1:43:47 PM) ensure the key is correctly stored in `state.fsKey`, removed internal `defer key.Wipe()` calls (relying on `closeAppState` for final wipe), and properly handled all error paths with `nil` key returns.
    *   The `getCryptoKey` function was completed (1:44:06 PM) to correctly return `state.fsKey, ExitSuccess, nil` on successful key retrieval or creation.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright & Ownership**: All files begin with a Juniper Networks copyright notice, indicating the code's origin.
*   **Logging**: Extensive use of a custom `log` package (e.g., `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Errorf`) for detailed tracing, informational messages, and error reporting throughout the application.
*   **Error Handling and Exit Codes**: A consistent pattern of returning custom `ExitCode` values (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitCompromised`) and wrapping errors using `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)` for detailed context propagation.
*   **Secure Key Management**: A central theme is the secure handling of cryptographic keys (`fscrypto.Key`). This involves:
    *   **Lazy Loading**: The `appState.fsKey` is lazy-loaded via `getCryptoKey`.
    *   **Memory Wiping**: Keys are explicitly wiped from memory using `key.Wipe()` or manual byte zeroing (`for i := range inputKey { inputKey[i] = 0 }`) to prevent sensitive data leakage. This responsibility evolved from individual functions to being centralized in `closeAppState` for the `appState.fsKey`.
*   **TPM and Filesystem Encryption Integration**: The application relies heavily on TPM (Trusted Platform Module) for initialization and `fscrypt` for managing encrypted directories, signifying a focus on hardware-backed security for data at rest.
*   **Environment Validation**: Critical environment checks (root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support) are consistently performed before proceeding with security operations.
*   **`TODO` Comments**: Numerous `TODO` comments highlight areas for future development, such as command-line argument parsing and manifest processing.
