# Activity Summary for 11/21/2025

## 3:26:37 PM
The log captures changes across two Go source files related to an "Integrity Handler" application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go**:
    *   This file, recorded at **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**, defines a set of constant strings representing critical directory paths for the Integrity Handler. These include `BootDirPath` (`/boot/integrity`), `EncryptedKeyPath` (`/boot/integrity/femk.enc`), `MigrationDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`), `RecoveryDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`), and `ManifestDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`). It establishes the fundamental locations where the Integrity Handler stores its data and encrypted keys.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go**:
    *   This file was recorded at **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**, **2:27:22 PM**, **2:28:49 PM**, and **2:40:35 PM**. Across these timestamps, the code content remained identical, suggesting multiple saves or commits of the same version without functional changes within this log.
    *   The file implements the core logic of the Integrity Handler. Key functions include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements such as running as root, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`), and TPM/vTPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: An idempotent function responsible for ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving a File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Uses the resolved filesystem key to unlock encrypted directories, treating most failures as integrity compromises.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function to retrieve the filesystem key from a secure vault after decrypting the FEMK, with explicit zeroing of the plaintext key slice for security.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates all required directories with specific permissions (e.g., `0o750` for migration/recovery/manifest, `0o700` for boot integrity dir) and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for contents in the recovery directory and logs warnings if data is found, indicating potential issues requiring manual intervention.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice**: All provided code snippets begin with `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`, indicating consistent ownership and intellectual property declarations.
*   **Security and Integrity Focus**: The entire codebase is centered around system integrity, utilizing `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, TPM for key protection, and a `vault.SecureContainer` for secure in-memory key storage. The `errIntegrityCompromised` error signifies a critical security aspect.
*   **Go Language Conventions**: Adherence to standard Go practices, including structured error handling (`fmt.Errorf` with `%w`), package imports, and descriptive function names.
*   **Directory Management**: Frequent use of the `afero` filesystem abstraction for robust directory creation, existence checks, and cleanup, leveraging constants defined in `common/directories.go`.
*   **Logging**: Consistent use of a `log` package (e.g., `log.Debug`, `log.Warnf`, `log.Errorf`) for reporting operational status and issues.

## 4:26:45 PM
The logs show a focused development effort on an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily written in Go, with multiple updates occurring on November 21, 2025. The application is designed to manage filesystem encryption and ensure system integrity, leveraging `fscrypt` and TPM/vTPM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file defines key directory paths as constants for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted FEMK - File Encryption Master Key), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`. The package comment mentions a secure container for keys using mmap'ed and mlocked memory.
    *   **Later update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** The package-level comment was changed from a detailed description of secure key containers to a more general `Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler.`, simplifying the documentation for this specific file. The directory constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Multiple timestamps (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM):** This is a core application file. The content appears to be stable across these timestamps, suggesting minor non-code changes or repeated saves. Key functionalities include:
        *   **Environment verification:** `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` checks if the application runs as root, if the kernel version is at least 5.4, if the filesystem supports encryption (using `fscrypt`'s `CheckSupport`), if the `fscrypt` command is installed, and initializes the TPM via `tpm.InitializeTPM`.
        *   **Integrity enablement:** `enableIntegrity` is an idempotent function that ensures necessary directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`), creates and resolves the FEMK, sets up `fscrypt` on the mount point, and orchestrates the encryption of target directories using `fscrypt.EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   **Key management:** `getFsKey` lazy-loads the filesystem key, decrypting the FEMK, securing it in a `vault.SecureContainer`, and then securely wiping the original plain key.
        *   **Directory management:** `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates all required directories with specific permissions (0o750 or 0o700) and attempts to clean the migration directory. `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` checks for any leftover data in the recovery directory, logging warnings if found, indicating potential past failures requiring manual intervention.
        *   **Error handling:** Defines `errIntegrityCompromised` and uses structured error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`) throughout.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **First appearance (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This is the entry point for the Integrity Handler application.
        *   It defines `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with systemd service return codes.
        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mountPath` flag, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application logic: logging the version, setting up application state, handling recovery directory warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity, and unlocking encrypted directories. It handles different error conditions, returning specific `ExitCode` values, particularly distinguishing between incompatible environments, general failures, and integrity compromises.
        *   Uses `//go:embed` to include the application version.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **First appearance (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines a set of specific error types related to `fscrypt` failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`).
        *   `SetupOnMount` handles global `fscrypt` configuration and filesystem-specific setup.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the outcome of encryption operations, categorizing directories as `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, or various failure types (e.g., `FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`). It includes methods `Failed()` to check for any critical failures and `BuildError()` to generate a composite error message.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` is an idempotent function that iterates through target directories, checking if they are already encrypted before attempting `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` implements the core encryption logic: relocating directory contents to a temporary location, recreating the target directory with appropriate permissions, encrypting the empty target, and then (implicitly, though not fully shown in the snippet) restoring the contents or moving them to a recovery directory in case of failure.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Licensing:** All code snippets include the copyright `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Security Focus:** There's a strong emphasis on security and integrity, indicated by the name "Integrity Handler," use of `fscrypt` for encryption, reliance on TPM, secure key handling (secure containers, key wiping), and explicit checks for integrity compromises.
*   **Structured Error Handling:** The code consistently uses Go's error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`) and error joining (`errors.Join`) to provide rich error contexts. Custom error types are defined for specific failure conditions.
*   **Idempotency:** Several critical functions, such as `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly designed to be idempotent, ensuring that repeated calls do not cause unintended side effects and can safely re-establish a desired state.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The `afero.Fs` interface is used for filesystem operations, allowing for easier testing and potentially different backend storage implementations.
*   **Directory Management and Recovery:** The application manages several dedicated directories for migration, recovery, and manifests, demonstrating a robust approach to managing intermediate states and potential failure scenarios during encryption processes.
*   **Logging:** The `log` package is extensively used (`log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warn`, `log.Error`) for tracing execution, diagnostics, and reporting operational status and issues.
*   **Timestamps:** All changes are concentrated on a single date, November 21, 2025, suggesting a coordinated development or refactoring effort around the Integrity Handler application.
