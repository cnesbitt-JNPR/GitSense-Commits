## 4:26:45 PM
The logs show a focused development effort on an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily written in Go, with multiple updates occurring on November 21, 2025. The application is designed to manage filesystem encryption and ensure system integrity, leveraging `fscrypt` and TPM/vTPM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file defines key directory paths as constants for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted FEMK - File Encryption Master Key), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`. The package comment mentions a secure container for keys using mmap'ed and mlocked memory.
    *   **Later update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** The package-level comment was changed from a detailed description of secure key containers to a more general `Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler.`, simplifying the documentation for this specific file. The directory constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Multiple timestamps (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM):** This is a core application file. The content appears to be stable across these timestamps, suggesting minor non-code changes or repeated saves. Key functionalities include:
        *   **Environment verification:** `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` checks if the application runs as root, if the kernel version is at least 5.4, if the filesystem supports encryption (using `fscrypt`'s `CheckSupport`), if the `fscrypt` command is installed, and initializes the TPM via `tpm.InitializeTPM`.
        *   **Integrity enablement:** `enableIntegrity` is an idempotent function that ensures necessary directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`), creates and resolves the FEMK, sets up `fscrypt` on the mount point, and orchestrates the encryption of target directories using `fscrypt.EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   **Key management:** `getFsKey` lazy-loads the filesystem key, decrypting the FEMK, securing it in a `vault.SecureContainer`, and then securely wiping the original plain key.
        *   **Directory management:** `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates all required directories with specific permissions (0o750 or 0o700) and attempts to clean the migration directory. `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` checks for any leftover data in the recovery directory, logging warnings if found, indicating potential past failures requiring manual intervention.
        *   **Error handling:** Defines `errIntegrityCompromised` and uses structured error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`) throughout.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **First appearance (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This is the entry point for the Integrity Handler application.
        *   It defines `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with systemd service return codes.
        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mountPath` flag, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application logic: logging the version, setting up application state, handling recovery directory warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity, and unlocking encrypted directories. It handles different error conditions, returning specific `ExitCode` values, particularly distinguishing between incompatible environments, general failures, and integrity compromises.
        *   Uses `//go:embed` to include the application version.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **First appearance (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines a set of specific error types related to `fscrypt` failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`).
        *   `SetupOnMount` handles global `fscrypt` configuration and filesystem-specific setup.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the outcome of encryption operations, categorizing directories as `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, or various failure types (e.g., `FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`). It includes methods `Failed()` to check for any critical failures and `BuildError()` to generate a composite error message.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` is an idempotent function that iterates through target directories, checking if they are already encrypted before attempting `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` implements the core encryption logic: relocating directory contents to a temporary location, recreating the target directory with appropriate permissions, encrypting the empty target, and then (implicitly, though not fully shown in the snippet) restoring the contents or moving them to a recovery directory in case of failure.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Licensing:** All code snippets include the copyright `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Security Focus:** There's a strong emphasis on security and integrity, indicated by the name "Integrity Handler," use of `fscrypt` for encryption, reliance on TPM, secure key handling (secure containers, key wiping), and explicit checks for integrity compromises.
*   **Structured Error Handling:** The code consistently uses Go's error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`) and error joining (`errors.Join`) to provide rich error contexts. Custom error types are defined for specific failure conditions.
*   **Idempotency:** Several critical functions, such as `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly designed to be idempotent, ensuring that repeated calls do not cause unintended side effects and can safely re-establish a desired state.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The `afero.Fs` interface is used for filesystem operations, allowing for easier testing and potentially different backend storage implementations.
*   **Directory Management and Recovery:** The application manages several dedicated directories for migration, recovery, and manifests, demonstrating a robust approach to managing intermediate states and potential failure scenarios during encryption processes.
*   **Logging:** The `log` package is extensively used (`log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warn`, `log.Error`) for tracing execution, diagnostics, and reporting operational status and issues.
*   **Timestamps:** All changes are concentrated on a single date, November 21, 2025, suggesting a coordinated development or refactoring effort around the Integrity Handler application.

        *   `enableIntegrity`: An idempotent function that ensures necessary directories exist, creates and resolves the FEMK, sets up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypts target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks encrypted directories using the filesystem key, reporting integrity compromise on failure.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function to decrypt the FEMK and store the plain key in a secure vault, ensuring the original key slice is wiped afterwards.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and sets permissions for the application's required directories (migration, recovery, manifest, boot), including cleaning the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for and logs warnings about contents found in the recovery directory, indicating a need for manual intervention.
    *   **Subsequent updates (11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM):** The content of this file remained identical across these three timestamps, suggesting minor non-functional changes like file saves or automated reformatting without code alterations.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go**
    *   **Single update (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This is the main entry point for the Integrity Handler. It defines `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes (success, failure, incompatible environment, integrity compromised). The `main` function parses a `mountPath` argument, sets up logging, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the integrity process: logging version, initializing application state, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity on target directories (obtained from `DefaultManifest`), and unlocking already encrypted directories. It handles errors by returning specific `ExitCode` values, particularly `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go**
    *   **Single update (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines various error types related to encryption targets, directory states, and `fscrypt` support. Key components include:
        *   `protectorName`: A constant "FEMK" for the protector.
        *   `SetupOnMount`: An idempotent function to perform global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup for a given mount point.
        *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct to track the detailed outcome of encryption attempts for multiple targets (success, already encrypted, various failure modes like relocation, encryption, unlocking, restoring, recovery failures). It includes methods to check if failures occurred and to build a composite error message.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: An idempotent function that iterates through target directories, checks if they are already encrypted, and calls `encryptTargetDir` for unencrypted ones.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: This function orchestrates the encryption of a single target directory. It involves moving existing contents out to a temporary migration directory, recreating the target directory as empty with original permissions, encrypting the empty target, and then implicitly (based on comments) moving the contents back. It includes logic for moving contents to a recovery directory in case of severe failures.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial definition of `common/directories.go`, establishing key paths.
