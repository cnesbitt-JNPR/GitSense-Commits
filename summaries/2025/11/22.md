## 12:26:49 AM
The changes log details the initial development and minor refinements of a Go application named "Integrity Handler," focused on ensuring system integrity through filesystem encryption.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was introduced, defining essential constant paths for the Integrity Handler. These paths include `/boot/integrity` for handler files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), and dedicated directories under `/opt/128technology/integrity` for migration data, recovery, and integrity manifests.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update occurred, changing the package documentation comment from detailing secure container reliance to a more general description of containing "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined directory constants remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This timestamp marks the initial substantial implementation of the core Integrity Handler logic. Key functionalities introduced include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like root privileges, a minimum kernel version (5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`), the presence of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Manages the overall encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, handling FEMK resolution and decryption, setting up `fscrypt` on the target mount, and initiating encryption for specified directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Provides functionality to unlock previously encrypted directories, raising an integrity compromised error on failure.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function for the filesystem key, which involves decrypting the FEMK, storing the plaintext key in a `vault.SecureContainer` for security, and then securely wiping the original plaintext byte slice.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and manages permissions for various application directories, including cleaning up the migration store.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if any data is found in the recovery directory, suggesting potential prior failures requiring manual intervention.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**, **2:28:49 PM**, **2:40:35 PM**: No functional code changes were observed in this file across these three timestamps. These entries likely correspond to saving the file, reformatting, or non-substantive commits.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This commit introduced the application's main entry point and overall orchestration. It defines standard `ExitCode` constants (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitCompromised`), uses Go's `embed` directive for a version string, parses a `mount` path argument, and calls the core `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the environment verification, integrity enabling, and directory unlocking, with robust error handling that maps specific failures to appropriate exit codes, notably `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file was added, implementing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` functionality. It defines various specific error conditions related to `fscrypt` operations (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`). Key functions include:
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Performs global `fscrypt` setup and enables `fscrypt` on a specified mount point, handling cases where it's already set up.
        *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct designed to track the detailed outcomes of encryption attempts, including successes, directories already encrypted, and various types of failures (relocation, encryption, unlocking, restoration).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Initiates the encryption process for a list of directories.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Contains the detailed, idempotent logic for encrypting a single directory, which involves temporarily moving its contents, creating an empty encrypted directory, and then restoring the contents. It also includes error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## 1:26:43 AM
A new Go application, "Integrity Handler", is being developed, focusing on file system encryption and integrity management. The codebase is under Juniper Networks copyright (2025).

**File-specific updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initialized, defining several constant directory paths crucial for the Integrity Handler's operation. These include `BootDirPath` ("/boot/integrity"), `EncryptedKeyPath` ("/boot/integrity/femk.enc" for the File Encryption Master Key), `MigrationDirPath` ("/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store"), `RecoveryDirPath` ("/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery"), and `ManifestDirPath` ("/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d").
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated for clarity, changing from a detailed explanation about secure containers and mmap'ed memory to a simpler "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constant definitions remained unchanged.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This core file was introduced, outlining the main logic for the Integrity Handler. Key functionalities include:
        *   **Environment verification**: `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` checks for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
        *   **Integrity enabling**: `enableIntegrity` ensures required directories exist, handles FEMK creation and retrieval, sets up `fscrypt` on the mount, and orchestrates the encryption of target directories. It's designed to be idempotent.
        *   **Key management**: `getFsKey` lazy-loads the filesystem key, decrypting the FEMK, storing it in a secure container, and securely wiping the plain key from memory.
        *   **Directory management**: `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates necessary paths with specific permissions and attempts to clean the migration directory. `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` checks for residual data in the recovery directory, logging warnings for manual intervention if found.
        *   **Integrity violation handling**: An `errIntegrityCompromised` error is defined and used when unlocking encrypted directories fails, indicating a potential security breach.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**, **2:28:49 PM**, **2:40:35 PM**: No functional or content changes were recorded for this file at these timestamps, suggesting minor non-content-altering operations (e.g., saving without changes, reformatting, or metadata updates).

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: The main entry point for the Integrity Handler application was established. It defines `ExitCode` constants mirroring systemd service return values (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`). The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path argument, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function coordinates the `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs` steps, propagating specific exit codes based on success or various failure types (incompatible environment, integrity compromise, generic failure). It also uses `//go:embed` to embed a version string.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This new file was added to abstract `fscrypt` operations. It defines specific error types for common `fscrypt` failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`). It introduces:
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup, gracefully managing cases where `fscrypt` is already configured.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: A detailed structure to track the outcomes of encryption attempts for multiple directories, including successes and various failure categories. It provides methods to check for failures and build composite error messages.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: The primary function to encrypt directories. It iterates through targets, checks if they are already encrypted, and for new targets, calls `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: This function orchestrates the actual encryption process for a single directory. It captures current permissions, moves existing contents to a temporary migration directory, recreates the target directory as empty, encrypts the new empty target directory, and then handles errors by logging them and populating the `EncryptionResult` struct, potentially migrating contents to a recovery directory if recreation fails.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright**: All files include a "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." header.
*   **Error Handling**: Go's idiomatic error handling (`if err != nil`) is prevalent throughout, with `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)` used for error wrapping and `errors.Is` or `errors.As` for checking specific error types.
*   **Logging**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is consistently used for logging debug, info, warning, and error messages.
*   **Idempotency**: The `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` functions are explicitly designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be safely called multiple times without adverse side effects.
*   **Integrity and Security Focus**: The entire codebase revolves around ensuring system integrity, evident in the use of `fscrypt` for encryption, TPM initialization, secure key handling (`vault.SecureContainer`), and explicit checks for integrity compromises.
*   **Directory Management**: The `common` package centralizes directory path definitions, which are then used consistently across `integrity.go` and `fscrypt.go` for creating, cleaning, and recovering data in specific locations. The `afero.Fs` interface is used for file system operations, allowing for easier testing and abstraction.
*   **Future Work/TODOs**: Comments like "// TODO: best effort shred would be better here." and "// Major TODO: // - Need to process any manifests..." indicate ongoing development and planned enhancements.

## 2:26:46 AM
The codebase primarily focuses on an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, developed by Juniper Networks in 2025, designed to manage encrypted file systems using `fscrypt` and TPM.

    *   **Minor update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** The package comment was slightly rephrased for clarity, changing from "Package common common a secure container..." to "Package common contains common globals...". The defined constants and their values remained unchanged.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go**
    *   **Consistent state across multiple timestamps (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM):** This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler. It defines an `errIntegrityCompromised` error and several key functions:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Ensures the system meets requirements, checking for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata`), `fscrypt` command existence, and TPM/vTPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Designed to be idempotent, it ensures necessary directories exist, resolves the FEMK, sets up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypts target directories. It uses `afero.Fs` for filesystem operations.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks previously encrypted directories, flagging failures as integrity compromises.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function that decrypts the FEMK, stores it in a `vault.SecureContainer`, and securely wipes the plaintext key from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and sets permissions for all required directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) and attempts to clean the `MigrationDirPath`.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for existing data in the `RecoveryDirPath` and logs warnings if found, indicating potential data loss requiring manual intervention.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go**
    *   **Introduced/updated (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This is the application's entry point. It defines custom `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for systemd service compatibility. The `main` function sets log levels, parses a `mountPath` flag, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the Integrity Handler's operations, including version logging, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity for `DefaultManifest` targets, and unlocking directories. It maps various errors to appropriate `ExitCode` values, particularly distinguishing between incompatible environments, generic failures, and integrity compromises.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go**
    *   **Introduced/updated (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This package provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous specific `Err` constants for various failure conditions related to encryption (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrDestinationNotEmpty`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`). Key components include:
        *   `protectorName`: A constant set to "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Performs global `fscrypt` setup and filesystem-specific setup for a given mount path, handling cases where it's already set up.
        *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct to track the detailed outcome of encryption attempts for multiple targets, categorizing them into `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, `FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRestore`, and `FailedToRecover`. It includes `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods for summarizing the results.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through a list of target directories, calling `encryptTargetDir` for each one.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Manages the encryption process for a single directory, which involves: relocating existing contents to a temporary migration directory, recreating the target directory with appropriate permissions, encrypting the empty target directory, and handling failures at each step, including moving contents to a recovery directory if recreation fails.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: `directories.go` first defines core path constants.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: `integrity.go` shows a fully fleshed-out core logic for environmental checks, encryption enablement, and key management. The lack of changes over the next few log entries (up to `2:40:35 PM`) suggests this part of the code was stable during that period.

*   **Structured Error Handling**: The codebase extensively uses Go's error handling patterns, including custom error types, `errors.Is` and `errors.As` for checking error kinds, and `errors.Join` for aggregating multiple errors. Specific `ExitCode` values are used to communicate detailed application status to the operating system.
*   **Dependency on `fscrypt` and `afero`**: The application relies heavily on `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption operations and `github.com/spf13/afero` for abstracting filesystem operations, making the code more testable and potentially portable.
*   **Directory-Based Operations**: A significant portion of the logic revolves around managing specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, etc.) for storing keys, migration data, recovery data, and manifests, with careful attention to permissions and cleanup.
*   **Idempotency**: The design emphasizes idempotency for critical functions like `enableIntegrity` and `SetupOnMount`, ensuring that repeated calls do not cause unintended side effects.
*   **Logging**: Extensive use of `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warnf`, and `log.Errorf` indicates a well-instrumented application for debugging and operational monitoring.
*   **Version Management**: The `main.go` file uses `//go:embed` to embed version information, which is then trimmed and logged at startup.

    *   **11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM**: A change in `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` removed the explicit check for `afero.Exists(afero.NewOsFs(), common.RecoveryDirPath)`. The function now directly attempts to read the `RecoveryDirPath`, relying on `afero.ReadDir` to return an error if the directory doesn't exist, which will then be logged as a warning.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: No visible code changes compared to the previous timestamp.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file was introduced, defining the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application.
        *   It establishes `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) mapping to standard systemd service return codes.
        *   The `main` function parses a `--mount` flag, sets up logging, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the main application logic: logs the version, initializes application state, calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`.
        *   It implements comprehensive error handling, mapping specific error types (e.g., `errIntegrityCompromised`) to appropriate `ExitCode` values.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file was introduced, providing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines various error constants, such as `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrDestinationNotEmpty`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, and errors related to fscrypt support on mounts.
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup, ensuring idempotency.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the outcome of encryption attempts for various categories (Success, AlreadyEncrypted, FailedToRelocate, FailedToEncrypt, etc.) and provides `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` iterates through target directories, checking if they are already encrypted before calling `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` performs the actual encryption process, which involves moving existing contents out of the target, recreating an empty directory, encrypting it, and then handling potential recovery of contents if encryption fails.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on Security and Integrity**: The entire codebase is dedicated to ensuring system integrity, primarily through filesystem encryption managed by `fscrypt` and leveraging TPM for key management (`FEMK`).
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Consistent use of `errors.Is` and `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w")` for creating detailed, chainable errors, allowing for precise error detection and appropriate exit codes.
*   **Idempotency**: Several critical functions, such as `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects.
*   **Directory Management and Recovery**: There's a strong emphasis on managing temporary and recovery directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`) to handle data during encryption processes and in case of failures.
*   **Structured Logging**: The `log` package is extensively used (`Debug`, `Info`, `Warnf`, `Errorf`) across all components for detailed operational insights and troubleshooting.
*   **External Library Dependencies**: Heavy reliance on `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption mechanics and `github.com/spf13/afero` for filesystem abstraction, indicating a robust and testable design.
*   **Unified Timestamp**: All changes occur on the same date, `11/21/2025`, suggesting a concentrated period of development, integration, or finalization leading up to a release.

## 5:26:43 AM
The provided log details changes across four Go source files, all timestamped November 21, 2025, indicating a focused development session on the Integrity Handler application. The primary purpose of this application appears to be securing file systems through encryption, leveraging `fscrypt` and TPM for key management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   This file defines global constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` for handler files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` for migration data, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` for recovery data during failures, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` for integrity manifest files.
    *   A minor change occurred between 2:26:50 PM and 4:02:40 PM, updating the package comment from a more detailed description about secure containers for keys to a simpler `common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler.`. The constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   This is a central file for the Integrity Handler application, importing various modules like `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`, and `common`.
    *   It includes core functions for environment verification (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), which checks for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support, and TPM initialization.
    *   Functions `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` manage the encryption lifecycle, relying on a `vault.SecureContainer` to hold the FEMK. The `getFsKey` function securely retrieves and then wipes the plain key.
    *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function creates all necessary Integrity Handler directories with appropriate permissions (0o750 or 0o700 for `/boot/integrity`) and attempts to clean the migration directory.
    *   A notable change occurred at 2:28:49 PM. The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was modified. Previously, it explicitly checked if the `RecoveryDirPath` existed before attempting to read its contents. The updated version removes this explicit existence check, instead directly attempting to read the directory and logging a warning if an error occurs (which would include the directory not existing or being inaccessible).
    *   The code remained stable for subsequent timestamps at 2:27:22 PM and 2:40:35 PM, showing no further modifications.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM.
    *   This file serves as the application's entry point. It defines custom `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for process return values.
    *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` command-line flag, and orchestrates the `run` function.
    *   The `run` function manages the application flow: it logs the version, calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, performs environment initialization via `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, determines target directories (currently `DefaultManifest()`), then calls `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes comprehensive error handling to return appropriate `ExitCode` values, especially for integrity compromises.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM.
    *   This package provides high-level abstractions for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous specific error constants related to encryption and directory states (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`).
    *   The `protectorName` constant is set to "FEMK".
    *   `SetupOnMount` handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup, ensuring it's idempotent.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the success and various failure modes of encryption attempts, including relocation, encryption, unlocking, and restoration failures. It also provides `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods for consolidated error reporting.
    *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function orchestrates the encryption of multiple directories, with explicit notes about its idempotency requirement.
    *   The `encryptTargetDir` function details the process: moving contents out of the target to a temporary directory, recreating the target as an empty directory with original permissions, encrypting the new empty target, and then (implicitly, though not fully shown in the log snippet) moving contents back. Robust error handling is included, with provisions for recovery directories.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial commit/state of `directories.go` and `integrity.go` (first observed state).
*   **11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM:** Behavioral change in `integrity.go` regarding how `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` checks for the existence of the recovery directory.

*   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** Minor comment refinement in `common/directories.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** Introduction of `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, detailing the low-level encryption logic, error types, and the `EncryptionResult` structure, which are crucial for the integrity handler's functionality.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Licensing:** All files consistently include the copyright notice: `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`.
*   **Consistent Logging:** The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is used across all files for debugging, informational messages, and error reporting.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The Go error handling pattern, involving `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf("%w", err)`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.As`, is extensively used for structured and context-rich error reporting.
*   **Security Focus:** The core application revolves around data integrity and encryption, utilizing TPM and secure key containers (`vault.SecureContainer`) for the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK). The cleanup of plain keys after use (`plainKey[i] = 0`) demonstrates a secure coding practice.
*   **Idempotency:** Several key functions (`enableIntegrity`, `SetupOnMount`, `EncryptTargetDirs`) are explicitly designed and commented as idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects.
*   **Directory Management:** The `afero` filesystem abstraction library is consistently used for file and directory operations, ensuring portability and testability. Critical directories for migration and recovery are clearly defined and managed.
*   **`fscrypt` Integration:** The application heavily relies on `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, including checks for kernel and filesystem support.

## 6:26:47 AM
The provided log details the initial development of an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on securing system directories through encryption and integrity checks. The changes are concentrated on defining system paths, implementing core encryption/decryption logic, and setting up the main application flow.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM and 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM.
    *   This file defines critical constant paths for the Integrity Handler. Key paths include `/boot/integrity` (`BootDirPath`), the encrypted File Encryption Master Key (FEMK) at `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (`EncryptedKeyPath`), and directories for migration data (`MigrationDirPath`), recovery (`RecoveryDirPath`), and integrity manifests (`ManifestDirPath`) under `/opt/128technology/integrity/`.
    *   The second timestamp shows a minor comment update, clarifying that the package "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM.
    *   These entries reveal the core logic of the Integrity Handler. The code outlines functions for:
        *   **Environment Verification (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`):** Ensures the application runs as root, on a kernel version 5.4 or higher, with filesystem encryption support (checked via `fscrypt/metadata`), and that the `fscrypt` command is installed. It also initializes the TPM/vTPM (`tpm.InitializeTPM`).
        *   **Integrity Enablement (`enableIntegrity`):** Designed to be idempotent, this function creates necessary directories, resolves and securely stores the FEMK, sets up fscrypt on the mount point, and initiates the encryption of target directories.
        *   **Directory Unlocking (`unlockEncryptedDirs`):** Retrieves the FEMK and uses fscrypt to unlock previously encrypted directories, with failures treated as integrity compromises.
        *   **Key Management (`getFsKey`):** Lazily loads the filesystem key into a `vault.SecureContainer` after decryption and explicitly wipes the plaintext key from memory for security.
        *   **Directory Management (`ensureDirectoriesExist`):** Creates all required directories with specific permissions, ensuring the migration path is clean.
        *   **Recovery Warnings (`handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`):** Checks for residual data in the recovery directory and issues warnings, indicating potential data loss or manual intervention needs.
    *   The content across all four timestamps for this file appears functionally identical, suggesting repeated saves or minor, non-functional edits.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM.
    *   This file introduces the main entry point and orchestration for the Integrity Handler application.
    *   It defines custom `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised).
    *   The `main` function parses a `mount` path flag and calls the `run` function.
    *   The `run` function coordinates the execution flow: logging the version, handling recovery directory warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity (calling `enableIntegrity`), and unlocking encrypted directories (calling `unlockEncryptedDirs`). It meticulously handles errors at each stage, returning specific exit codes depending on the failure type, especially distinguishing integrity compromises.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM.
    *   This file provides high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` operations.
    *   It defines a suite of specific error types related to fscrypt operations (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrDestinationNotEmpty`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`).
    *   The `SetupOnMount` function performs global and filesystem-specific fscrypt setup.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct is introduced to track the detailed outcome of encryption attempts for multiple directories, including successes, already encrypted directories, and various failure categories (relocation, encryption, unlocking, restoration, recovery). It provides methods to check for hard failures and build a composite error message.
    *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function orchestrates the encryption process for multiple targets, ensuring idempotency.
    *   The `encryptTargetDir` function details the steps for encrypting a single directory: relocating its contents to a temporary directory (`MigrationDirPath`), recreating the target directory as empty, encrypting it, and handling errors by potentially moving contents to a recovery directory (`RecoveryDirPath`).

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Security-First Approach:** A strong emphasis on security is evident throughout the code, including the use of fscrypt for encryption, TPM for key protection, a `vault.SecureContainer` for runtime key storage, explicit wiping of plaintext keys, and strict permission settings for critical directories.
*   **Idempotency:** Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent, allowing them to be run multiple times without unintended side effects.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging:** The codebase features detailed error handling with custom error types, error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...) `), and extensive logging at various levels (Debug, Info, Warnf, Errorf) to provide visibility into the application's state and diagnose issues.
*   **Structured Directory Management:** The `common` package consistently defines and centralizes critical directory paths, which are then used across the application to manage migration, recovery, and manifest files systematically.
*   **Future Enhancements:** Several `TODO` comments highlight areas for future development, such as improved data shredding, manifest processing, and incorporating path management for upgrade scenarios.
*   **Copyright and Ownership:** All files include the `Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025` copyright notice, indicating a consistent project standard.

## 7:26:45 AM
The provided log details the initial development of an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption, key management, and system integrity checks. All timestamps are from November 21, 2025, indicating a future development or test log, and all files are copyrighted by Juniper Networks, Inc.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM and 4:02:40 PM.
    *   **Content:** This file defines critical constant paths for the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` for handler files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), and directories under `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration data (`.migration-store`), recovery data (`migration-recovery`), and integrity manifests (`manifest.d`).
    *   The primary change between the two timestamps is a minor update to the package comment, clarifying its role as containing "common globals" rather than explicitly mentioning the secure container for keys, though the core paths remain unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, and 2:40:35 PM.
    *   **Content:** This is a core component defining the `Integrity Handler`'s main logic. It imports several internal packages (`common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`) and external libraries (`fscrypt` from Google, `afero` for filesystem abstraction).
    *   Key functions include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Ensures the system meets requirements (root user, kernel >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command availability, TPM initialization).
        *   `enableIntegrity`: An idempotent function that sets up necessary directories, creates/resolves the FEMK, gets the filesystem key from a `vault.SecureContainer` (zeroing out the plaintext key for security), sets up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypts target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks previously encrypted directories, flagging failures as an integrity compromise.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates all specified directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) with appropriate permissions and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks the recovery directory for any lingering contents, indicating a prior failure that requires manual intervention.
    *   All four log entries for this file show identical content, suggesting frequent saves or non-substantive changes were captured during a short development period.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM.
    *   **Content:** This file acts as the application's entry point. It embeds version information, defines custom `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`), and parses a command-line `mount` flag.
    *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: it logs the handler version, initializes an application state, calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, and then `enableIntegrity` to apply encryption. It then attempts to `unlockEncryptedDirs` that were already encrypted. Error handling specifically distinguishes between incompatible environments, generic failures, and integrity compromises, returning corresponding exit codes. This file introduces the orchestrating logic that binds the other components together.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM.
    *   **Content:** This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines specific error types for various `fscrypt` conditions (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`).
    *   Key components:
        *   `protectorName` constant set to "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Configures `fscrypt` globally and on a specific mount point, handling idempotent calls.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: A detailed structure to report the outcome of encryption attempts, categorizing success, already encrypted, and various failure modes (relocation, encryption, unlocking, restoration, recovery).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: An idempotent function that iterates through target directories, checks if they are already encrypted, and calls `encryptTargetDir` for new ones.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Contains the core logic for encrypting a single directory. This involves temporarily moving existing contents out of the target directory to a migration store (`common.MigrationDirPath`), recreating the target as an empty encrypted directory, and then moving the contents back. It also includes error handling for these steps, with a mechanism to move contents to a recovery directory (`common.RecoveryDirPath`) if the encryption process fails, requiring manual intervention.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security and Integrity Focus:** The primary theme is ensuring system integrity through filesystem encryption, evidenced by references to FEMK, TPM, secure containers, and integrity compromise error handling.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The codebase is clearly structured into distinct Go packages (`common`, `integrity`, `main`, `fscrypt`, with `tpm` and `vault` imported), each responsible for specific aspects like directory definitions, core logic, application entry, and cryptographic operations.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** There's a strong emphasis on detailed error handling, with custom error types, composite error results (`EncryptionResult`), and explicit recovery mechanisms (e.g., `RecoveryDirPath`) to mitigate data loss during sensitive operations like encryption migration.
*   **Idempotency:** Several key functions (`enableIntegrity`, `EncryptTargetDirs`, `SetupOnMount`) are explicitly designed to be idempotent, ensuring that repeated calls do not cause adverse effects, which is crucial for reliability in system services.
*   **Directory Management:** A consistent pattern is the creation and management of specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) for handler files, keys, temporary data, and recovery information.
*   **Development Workflow:** The consecutive, identical log entries for `integrity.go` suggest a development phase with frequent saving or automated version control commits without functional changes.
*   **Future Planning:** The 2025 timestamps consistently across all entries indicate a planned future release or an environment set up for future development.
