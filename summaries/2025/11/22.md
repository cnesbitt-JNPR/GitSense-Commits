# Activity Summary for 11/22/2025

## 12:26:49 AM
The changes log details the initial development and minor refinements of a Go application named "Integrity Handler," focused on ensuring system integrity through filesystem encryption.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was introduced, defining essential constant paths for the Integrity Handler. These paths include `/boot/integrity` for handler files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), and dedicated directories under `/opt/128technology/integrity` for migration data, recovery, and integrity manifests.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update occurred, changing the package documentation comment from detailing secure container reliance to a more general description of containing "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined directory constants remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This timestamp marks the initial substantial implementation of the core Integrity Handler logic. Key functionalities introduced include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like root privileges, a minimum kernel version (5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`), the presence of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Manages the overall encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, handling FEMK resolution and decryption, setting up `fscrypt` on the target mount, and initiating encryption for specified directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Provides functionality to unlock previously encrypted directories, raising an integrity compromised error on failure.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function for the filesystem key, which involves decrypting the FEMK, storing the plaintext key in a `vault.SecureContainer` for security, and then securely wiping the original plaintext byte slice.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and manages permissions for various application directories, including cleaning up the migration store.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if any data is found in the recovery directory, suggesting potential prior failures requiring manual intervention.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**, **2:28:49 PM**, **2:40:35 PM**: No functional code changes were observed in this file across these three timestamps. These entries likely correspond to saving the file, reformatting, or non-substantive commits.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This commit introduced the application's main entry point and overall orchestration. It defines standard `ExitCode` constants (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitCompromised`), uses Go's `embed` directive for a version string, parses a `mount` path argument, and calls the core `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the environment verification, integrity enabling, and directory unlocking, with robust error handling that maps specific failures to appropriate exit codes, notably `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file was added, implementing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` functionality. It defines various specific error conditions related to `fscrypt` operations (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`). Key functions include:
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Performs global `fscrypt` setup and enables `fscrypt` on a specified mount point, handling cases where it's already set up.
        *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct designed to track the detailed outcomes of encryption attempts, including successes, directories already encrypted, and various types of failures (relocation, encryption, unlocking, restoration).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Initiates the encryption process for a list of directories.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Contains the detailed, idempotent logic for encrypting a single directory, which involves temporarily moving its contents, creating an empty encrypted directory, and then restoring the contents. It also includes error handling and recovery mechanisms.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright and Authorship**: All files consistently include the `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` header, indicating a common organizational origin.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: The codebase exhibits a strong pattern of comprehensive error handling, using Go's `errors.Is`, `errors.As`, and `errors.Join` for detailed error propagation and aggregation. Specific custom error types are defined for clarity.
*   **Logging**: A custom `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) is used extensively across all files for debugging, informational, warning, and error messages, ensuring detailed operational insights.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `afero` library (`github.com/spf13/afero`) is consistently employed for filesystem operations, suggesting a design choice for testability and flexibility (e.g., using in-memory filesystems for testing).
*   **Security Focus**: A strong emphasis on security is evident, particularly with the management of encryption keys. This includes explicit key wiping after use and the reliance on a `vault.SecureContainer` for handling sensitive key material. The overall purpose of the application is to enforce integrity through encryption.
*   **Idempotency**: Several core functions, such as `enableIntegrity` and `SetupOnMount`, are designed to be idempotent, allowing them to be safely executed multiple times without adverse effects.
*   **Directory Management**: There's a recurring theme of creating and managing specific application directories with precise file permissions, along with mechanisms for cleaning or recovering data within these directories.
*   **TODO Comments**: The presence of `// TODO:` comments indicates ongoing development, planned features, or areas for improvement, such as implementing "best effort shred" for data cleanup, integrating paths for upgrade scenarios, and processing manifest files.

## 1:26:43 AM
A new Go application, "Integrity Handler", is being developed, focusing on file system encryption and integrity management. The codebase is under Juniper Networks copyright (2025).

**File-specific updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initialized, defining several constant directory paths crucial for the Integrity Handler's operation. These include `BootDirPath` ("/boot/integrity"), `EncryptedKeyPath` ("/boot/integrity/femk.enc" for the File Encryption Master Key), `MigrationDirPath` ("/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store"), `RecoveryDirPath` ("/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery"), and `ManifestDirPath` ("/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d").
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated for clarity, changing from a detailed explanation about secure containers and mmap'ed memory to a simpler "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constant definitions remained unchanged.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This core file was introduced, outlining the main logic for the Integrity Handler. Key functionalities include:
        *   **Environment verification**: `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` checks for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
        *   **Integrity enabling**: `enableIntegrity` ensures required directories exist, handles FEMK creation and retrieval, sets up `fscrypt` on the mount, and orchestrates the encryption of target directories. It's designed to be idempotent.
        *   **Key management**: `getFsKey` lazy-loads the filesystem key, decrypting the FEMK, storing it in a secure container, and securely wiping the plain key from memory.
        *   **Directory management**: `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates necessary paths with specific permissions and attempts to clean the migration directory. `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` checks for residual data in the recovery directory, logging warnings for manual intervention if found.
        *   **Integrity violation handling**: An `errIntegrityCompromised` error is defined and used when unlocking encrypted directories fails, indicating a potential security breach.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**, **2:28:49 PM**, **2:40:35 PM**: No functional or content changes were recorded for this file at these timestamps, suggesting minor non-content-altering operations (e.g., saving without changes, reformatting, or metadata updates).

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: The main entry point for the Integrity Handler application was established. It defines `ExitCode` constants mirroring systemd service return values (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`). The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path argument, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function coordinates the `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs` steps, propagating specific exit codes based on success or various failure types (incompatible environment, integrity compromise, generic failure). It also uses `//go:embed` to embed a version string.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This new file was added to abstract `fscrypt` operations. It defines specific error types for common `fscrypt` failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`). It introduces:
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup, gracefully managing cases where `fscrypt` is already configured.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: A detailed structure to track the outcomes of encryption attempts for multiple directories, including successes and various failure categories. It provides methods to check for failures and build composite error messages.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: The primary function to encrypt directories. It iterates through targets, checks if they are already encrypted, and for new targets, calls `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: This function orchestrates the actual encryption process for a single directory. It captures current permissions, moves existing contents to a temporary migration directory, recreates the target directory as empty, encrypts the new empty target directory, and then handles errors by logging them and populating the `EncryptionResult` struct, potentially migrating contents to a recovery directory if recreation fails.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright**: All files include a "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." header.
*   **Error Handling**: Go's idiomatic error handling (`if err != nil`) is prevalent throughout, with `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)` used for error wrapping and `errors.Is` or `errors.As` for checking specific error types.
*   **Logging**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is consistently used for logging debug, info, warning, and error messages.
*   **Idempotency**: The `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` functions are explicitly designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be safely called multiple times without adverse side effects.
*   **Integrity and Security Focus**: The entire codebase revolves around ensuring system integrity, evident in the use of `fscrypt` for encryption, TPM initialization, secure key handling (`vault.SecureContainer`), and explicit checks for integrity compromises.
*   **Directory Management**: The `common` package centralizes directory path definitions, which are then used consistently across `integrity.go` and `fscrypt.go` for creating, cleaning, and recovering data in specific locations. The `afero.Fs` interface is used for file system operations, allowing for easier testing and abstraction.
*   **Future Work/TODOs**: Comments like "// TODO: best effort shred would be better here." and "// Major TODO: // - Need to process any manifests..." indicate ongoing development and planned enhancements.
