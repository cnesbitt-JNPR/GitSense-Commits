# Activity Summary for 11/24/2025

## 12:26:48 AM
The provided log details changes across several Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focusing on filesystem encryption, secure key management, and system integrity verification.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**:
    *   At 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM, this file defined crucial constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key or FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`. The package comment specifically mentioned a "secure container to hold our key at runtime."
    *   At 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM, the package comment was updated to a more generic "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," while the defined constants and their values remained unchanged.
*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**:
    *   Across multiple timestamps (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 2:27:22 PM; 2:28:49 PM; 2:40:35 PM), this file consistently contained the core logic. It includes functions to:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Check system prerequisites such as running as root, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt/metadata`), availability of the `fscrypt` command, and initialization of a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) via `tpm.InitializeTPM`.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrate the encryption process. This involves ensuring necessary directories exist, creating/resolving the FEMK, setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and then encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlock previously encrypted directories, flagging an "integrity compromised" error if unlocking fails.
        *   `getFsKey`: Securely retrieve the filesystem key by decrypting the FEMK and storing the plain key in a `vault.SecureContainer`, explicitly wiping the original plain key slice from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Create required directories with specific permissions and clean out any existing contents from the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Check for contents in the recovery directory and issue warnings, indicating potential data loss scenarios requiring manual intervention.
*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**:
    *   At 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM, this file was the application's entry point. It sets up logging, defines specific `ExitCode` values (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitCompromised`, `ExitIncompatible`), parses a `mountPath` argument, and orchestrates the overall integrity workflow by calling functions from `integrity.go`. It uses a `DefaultManifest()` to determine which directories to encrypt and handles different error conditions by returning appropriate exit codes.
*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**:
    *   At 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM, this file provided high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` functionality. It defined various specific error types related to `fscrypt` operations. Key functions include:
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Configures `fscrypt` globally and on the specified mount path, handling cases where it's already set up.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: A detailed structure for tracking the outcome of encryption attempts, categorizing targets into `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, and various failure types (`FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, etc.).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through a list of target directories, calling `encryptTargetDir` for each. It's designed to be idempotent.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Implements the detailed encryption process for a single directory, which involves temporarily relocating its contents, recreating the directory, encrypting it, and then moving the contents back. It also handles moving contents to a recovery directory in case of encryption failures.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   The foundational directory paths and initial design for secure key handling were committed at **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**.
*   The core integrity logic in `integrity.go` was consistently present and stable across multiple timestamps between **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** and **2:40:35 PM**, indicating a period of active development or review without functional changes to this specific file.
*   The application's `main` entry point, defining the overall execution flow and exit codes, was introduced around **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**.
*   A minor textual update to the package comment in `common/directories.go` occurred shortly after at **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**.
*   The detailed `fscrypt` integration and error handling mechanisms were finalized around **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**.

    *   **Timestamp:** Initial entry at `11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM`. A later update occurred at `11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM`.
    *   **Updates:** The primary change in this file was a clarification of its package comment. It initially described holding keys in a secure container relying on `mmap`'ed and `mlocked` memory, while also containing common variables. The updated comment simplifies this to "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constant directory paths, such as `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`, remained consistent.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries at `11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM`, `11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM`, `11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM`, and `11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM`.
    *   **Updates:** The content of this file appears to be identical across all provided timestamps. It implements the core logic of the Integrity Handler. Key functionalities include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt.CheckSupport`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process by ensuring necessary directories exist, managing the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK) securely, setting up `fscrypt` on the target mount point, and initiating directory encryption.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles the unlocking of encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading mechanism for the filesystem key, which is stored in a secure container and then securely wiped from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and sets permissions for critical directories used for migration, recovery, manifests, and boot files. It also attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks the recovery directory for any lingering files that might indicate a failed migration, issuing warnings for manual intervention.
        *   An `errIntegrityCompromised` error is defined and utilized to specifically flag integrity violations during key decryption or directory unlocking.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM`.

        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `-mount` command-line flag, and calls the central `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the entire application flow: logs the handler version, manages an application state, handles recovery directory warnings, verifies the environment (returning `ExitIncompatible` if checks fail), calls `enableIntegrity` to encrypt specified targets (with a `DefaultManifest()` placeholder for future manifest processing), and then `unlockEncryptedDirs` for already encrypted targets. It robustly handles errors, mapping them to the appropriate `ExitCode`s, notably `ExitCompromised` for integrity failures.
        *   Uses `//go:embed` to include a version string from an external file (`integrity-handler.version`).

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM`.
    *   **Updates:** This file introduces a new package `fscrypt` dedicated to abstracting high-level `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines various specific error types to describe different `fscrypt` failure conditions (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`).
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function provides an idempotent mechanism to perform global `fscrypt` setup and then configure `fscrypt` for a specific mount path.
        *   A new `EncryptionResult` struct is introduced to provide a detailed breakdown of the outcome of encryption attempts for multiple directories, distinguishing between successes, already encrypted targets, and various types of failures (relocation, encryption, unlocking, restoration, recovery). It includes helper methods to check for failures and construct comprehensive error messages.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` handles the encryption of a list of target directories, calling `encryptTargetDir` for each.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` implements the core, idempotent logic for encrypting a single directory: it temporarily moves existing contents out, recreates the directory with appropriate permissions, encrypts the now-empty directory, and includes sophisticated error handling with recovery steps (e.g., moving contents to a dedicated recovery directory if encryption fails).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Ownership:** All files consistently include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`, indicating development by Juniper Networks.

    *   **Timestamp:** 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM
    *   This package provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
    *   It defines various custom error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`).
    *   The `protectorName` constant is set to "FEMK".
    *   `SetupOnMount`: An idempotent function that performs global `fscrypt` setup and filesystem-specific setup for a given mount path.
    *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct that detailed tracks the outcome of encryption attempts for multiple targets, categorizing them into success, already encrypted, and various failure modes (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, recovery). It includes methods to check for failures and build composite error messages.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: The main function to encrypt a list of target directories. It iterates through targets, checks if they are already encrypted, and calls `encryptTargetDir` for new encryptions. This function is also stated to be idempotent.
    *   `encryptTargetDir`: This internal helper moves directory contents to a temporary location, recreates the target directory as empty with original permissions, encrypts it, and includes logic for recovery if operations fail.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**

*   **Copyright and Versioning:** All files begin with a Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025. The `main.go` file uses `//go:embed` for version management.
*   **Security Focus:** The codebase heavily emphasizes security, particularly filesystem encryption (`fscrypt`), key management (`FEMK`, `vault.SecureContainer`), and hardware-backed security (`tpm`). The concept of "integrity compromised" is a central error state.
*   **Directory Structure and Management:** There's a clear pattern of defining and managing specific directories for application operations, temporary data, and recovery (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`). Functions like `ensureDirectoriesExist` ensure these are properly set up.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code consistently uses Go's `errors.Is` and `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)` for wrapping and propagating errors, allowing for detailed error analysis. Custom error types are also defined for specific failure scenarios, especially in the `fscrypt` package.
*   **Idempotency:** The `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` functions are explicitly designed to be idempotent, indicating a design philosophy for reliable, repeatable operations without side effects on repeated execution.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** Multiple changes to `integrity.go` occurred within very short intervals (seconds to minutes), suggesting rapid development, minor fixes, or frequent saving during a coding session. The `directories.go` file also saw a minor update within a couple of hours.
*   **Dependency on External Libraries:** The project relies on `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption, `github.com/spf13/afero` for filesystem abstraction, and `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` for logging.

## 5:26:49 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go files within an `IntegrityHandler` application, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity management.

### File-Specific Updates:

    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was introduced, defining essential constant paths for the Integrity Handler. These include `BootDirPath` (`/boot/integrity`), `EncryptedKeyPath` (`/boot/integrity/femk.enc`), `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath` (all under `/opt/128technology/integrity/`). The initial package comment briefly mentioned a secure container for keys and common variables.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update occurred, changing only the package comment to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined directory constants remained the same.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This file was introduced as a core component of the Integrity Handler. It includes:
        *   Functions to `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, checking prerequisites like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity` orchestrates directory creation, FEMK (File Encryption Master Key) resolution, filesystem key management, `fscrypt` setup, and target directory encryption.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs` handles unlocking.
        *   `getFsKey` securely loads and manages the filesystem key, including wiping the plaintext key from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates necessary directories with appropriate permissions and cleans the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` logs warnings if data is found in the recovery directory, indicating a need for manual intervention.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM**: No functional code changes were made to this file at these timestamps; the content remained identical to the initial version.

It defines custom `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`). The `main` function initializes logging, parses a mount path argument, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the overall integrity process: logging version, initializing application state, checking for recovery warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity by encrypting targets, and then unlocking any already-encrypted directories. It meticulously handles errors, returning specific `ExitCode` values, particularly `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file was introduced, providing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. Key features include:
        *   Numerous specific `error` constants for various `fscrypt`-related failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`).
        *   A `protectorName` constant set to "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount` for idempotent global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup.
        *   An `EncryptionResult` struct to provide a detailed breakdown of encryption outcomes, distinguishing between success, already encrypted, and multiple types of failures (relocation, encryption, unlocking, restoration, recovery).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` implement the core encryption logic, which involves relocating contents out of a target directory, recreating it as an empty encrypted directory, and then restoring contents. This process is designed to be idempotent and includes recovery mechanisms for failures.

    *   **Changes:** This file provides higher-level abstractions for interacting with the `fscrypt` utility. It defines several custom error types related to encryption targets, directory states, and `fscrypt` support.
    *   Key components include:
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Performs global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup for a given mount path, designed to be idempotent.
        *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct to track the detailed outcome of encryption attempts for multiple target directories, categorizing successes, already encrypted, and various failure types (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, recovery). It provides methods to check for failures (`Failed()`) and build a composite error message (`BuildError()`).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: An idempotent function that iterates through target directories, checks if they are already encrypted, and if not, calls `encryptTargetDir` to perform the actual encryption process.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: This core function manages the encryption of a single directory: it temporarily moves contents out, recreates the target directory as empty, encrypts the empty directory, and then moves the original contents back. It includes logic for handling permissions, creating temporary and recovery directories, and logging various failure points during this migration process.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright:** All Go files consistently include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`.
*   **Logging and Error Handling:** Extensive use of the `log` package (e.g., `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warnf`, `log.Errorf`) and Go's `errors` package (e.g., `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Is`, `errors.As`, `errors.Join`) for detailed error reporting and structured error propagation. The `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", parentErr, childErr)` pattern is common for error wrapping.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go**: This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler. It includes functions for verifying the environment (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), enabling encryption (`enableIntegrity`), unlocking encrypted directories (`unlockEncryptedDirs`), retrieving filesystem keys (`getFsKey`), and ensuring necessary directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`). The environment verification checks for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support, and TPM initialization. This file was logged multiple times (at **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**, **2:27:22 PM**, **2:28:49 PM**, and **2:40:35 PM**) without any content changes in the provided log, suggesting repeated saves or minor, non-substantive updates during this period.
*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go**: The main entry point for the application, updated at **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**. It handles command-line arguments (specifically a `mountPath`), sets up application-wide logging, defines custom exit codes for various scenarios (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised), and orchestrates the primary workflow by calling functions from other packages to verify the environment, handle recovery, enable integrity, and unlock encrypted directories.
*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go**: This file provides high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` operations, updated at **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**. It defines various specific error types related to encryption and directory management. Key functionalities include `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` configuration, and `EncryptTargetDirs` which manages the encryption process for specified directories, including relocating contents, encrypting the target, and handling potential recovery. It returns an `EncryptionResult` detailing successes and failures.

*   **Robust Error Handling and Recovery:** The code demonstrates extensive error handling, defining specific error types (e.g., `errIntegrityCompromised`, various `fscrypt` errors), using structured error returns (`EncryptionResult`), and implementing mechanisms to manage recovery directories (`RecoveryDirPath`) for manual intervention in case of failures during data migration or encryption. Logging is also extensively used for debugging, informational messages, and warnings.
*   **Directory Management:** There's a clear pattern of functions and constants dedicated to creating, cleaning, and moving directories (`ensureDirectoriesExist`, `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`), often using the `afero` library for filesystem abstraction.
*   **System Requirements:** The `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` function enforces strict system requirements including running as root, a minimum kernel version (5.4), and filesystem encryption support, underscoring the critical nature of the Integrity Handler's operations.
*   **Dependency Usage:** The project consistently imports external libraries like `github.com/google/fscrypt` and `github.com/spf13/afero`, as well as internal packages (`common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`, `log`), indicating a modular and well-structured Go application.

## 11:26:46 AM
The log details development on a Go application named "Integrity Handler" by Juniper Networks, Inc., focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity management. Key themes include secure key handling, filesystem setup for encryption, and robust error management.

**File-specific updates and timestamps:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defines constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (BootDirPath), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (EncryptedKeyPath for the Filesystem Encryption Master Key), and various migration, recovery, and manifest directories under `/opt/128technology/integrity`. The initial package comment briefly mentioned a secure container for keys and common variables.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated from a detailed description of the secure container and common variables to a more concise `Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler.`. The constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This file outlines the core logic for the Integrity Handler. It includes functions for:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: An idempotent function responsible for ensuring necessary directories exist, creating and resolving the FEMK, obtaining the filesystem key from a secure vault, setting up `fscrypt` on the mount point, and initiating encryption of target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Uses the filesystem key to unlock encrypted directories, flagging failures as integrity compromises.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function to retrieve the decrypted FEMK from a `vault.SecureContainer`, securely wiping the plain key after use.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates all defined Integrity Handler directories with appropriate permissions (0o750 or 0o700 for `/boot/integrity`) and attempts to clean the `MigrationDirPath`.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for and logs warnings if any items are found in the `RecoveryDirPath`, indicating potential data loss requiring manual intervention.
    *   Subsequent entries for this file at **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**, **11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM**, and **11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM** show no functional changes; the code content is identical across these timestamps.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants for different process outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible Environment, Compromised Integrity). The `main` function parses a `--mount` flag, sets the log level to debug, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: logging the version, initializing application state, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes comprehensive error handling for integrity compromises and environmental incompatibilities, returning specific exit codes. It also uses `//go:embed` to include a version string.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file provides a high-level wrapper for `fscrypt` operations. It defines various `Err` constants for specific failure conditions related to encryption (e.g., target already encrypted, destination not empty, fscrypt not supported).
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Handles global `fscrypt` setup and filesystem-specific setup for a given mount path, ensuring idempotency.
        *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct to track the detailed outcome of encryption attempts for multiple directories, including successes, already encrypted paths, and various types of failures (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, recovery). It provides `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods to summarize issues.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: An idempotent function that iterates through a list of target directories, checking if each is already encrypted before calling `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: The core logic for encrypting a single directory. It first attempts to relocate the directory's contents to a migration store, recreates the target directory as an empty one with appropriate permissions, and then encrypts the empty directory using the provided key. It also includes partial logic for moving contents to a recovery directory in case of encryption failure.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice**: All files include the "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." header.
*   **Structured Logging**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is consistently used across all application files for debugging, informational, warning, and error messages.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Go's error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`) and error introspection (`errors.Is`, `errors.As`, `errors.Join`) are heavily utilized to provide detailed and contextual error information. Custom error types are defined for specific failure scenarios.
*   **Security Focus**: The code emphasizes security through:
    *   Filesystem encryption using `fscrypt`.
    *   Secure handling of the Filesystem Encryption Master Key (FEMK) via a `vault.SecureContainer` and TPM integration.
    *   Wiping plain keys from memory after use (`for i := range plainKey { plainKey[i] = 0 }`).
    *   Requiring root privileges.
    *   Strict directory permissions (0o750, 0o700).
*   **Idempotency**: Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed and commented to be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without unintended side effects.
*   **Common Directory Paths**: Directory paths are centralized as constants in `common/directories.go` and referenced throughout the application, promoting consistency and easier management.
*   **Dependency on External Libraries**: The project uses `github.com/google/fscrypt` (metadata, util, actions, filesystem packages), `github.com/spf13/afero` (for filesystem abstraction), and internal `tpm` and `vault` packages for specific functionalities.
*   **Future Work (TODOs)**: Several `// TODO` comments indicate planned enhancements, such as incorporating path for upgrade use cases, processing manifests, and implementing "best effort shred" for directory cleaning.
