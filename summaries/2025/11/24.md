# Activity Summary for 11/24/2025

## 12:26:48 AM
The provided log details changes across several Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focusing on filesystem encryption, secure key management, and system integrity verification.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**:
    *   At 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM, this file defined crucial constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key or FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`. The package comment specifically mentioned a "secure container to hold our key at runtime."
    *   At 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM, the package comment was updated to a more generic "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," while the defined constants and their values remained unchanged.
*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**:
    *   Across multiple timestamps (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 2:27:22 PM; 2:28:49 PM; 2:40:35 PM), this file consistently contained the core logic. It includes functions to:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Check system prerequisites such as running as root, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt/metadata`), availability of the `fscrypt` command, and initialization of a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) via `tpm.InitializeTPM`.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrate the encryption process. This involves ensuring necessary directories exist, creating/resolving the FEMK, setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and then encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlock previously encrypted directories, flagging an "integrity compromised" error if unlocking fails.
        *   `getFsKey`: Securely retrieve the filesystem key by decrypting the FEMK and storing the plain key in a `vault.SecureContainer`, explicitly wiping the original plain key slice from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Create required directories with specific permissions and clean out any existing contents from the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Check for contents in the recovery directory and issue warnings, indicating potential data loss scenarios requiring manual intervention.
*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**:
    *   At 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM, this file was the application's entry point. It sets up logging, defines specific `ExitCode` values (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitCompromised`, `ExitIncompatible`), parses a `mountPath` argument, and orchestrates the overall integrity workflow by calling functions from `integrity.go`. It uses a `DefaultManifest()` to determine which directories to encrypt and handles different error conditions by returning appropriate exit codes.
*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**:
    *   At 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM, this file provided high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` functionality. It defined various specific error types related to `fscrypt` operations. Key functions include:
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Configures `fscrypt` globally and on the specified mount path, handling cases where it's already set up.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: A detailed structure for tracking the outcome of encryption attempts, categorizing targets into `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, and various failure types (`FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, etc.).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through a list of target directories, calling `encryptTargetDir` for each. It's designed to be idempotent.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Implements the detailed encryption process for a single directory, which involves temporarily relocating its contents, recreating the directory, encrypting it, and then moving the contents back. It also handles moving contents to a recovery directory in case of encryption failures.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   The foundational directory paths and initial design for secure key handling were committed at **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**.
*   The core integrity logic in `integrity.go` was consistently present and stable across multiple timestamps between **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** and **2:40:35 PM**, indicating a period of active development or review without functional changes to this specific file.
*   The application's `main` entry point, defining the overall execution flow and exit codes, was introduced around **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**.
*   A minor textual update to the package comment in `common/directories.go` occurred shortly after at **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**.
*   The detailed `fscrypt` integration and error handling mechanisms were finalized around **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**.

    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM**: This file remained consistent across these timestamps, indicating that the core integrity logic was stable during this period, or that these timestamps represent saves without functional changes.
    *   This file outlines the central application logic:
        *   It defines an `errIntegrityCompromised` error, crucial for integrity violation detection.
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` checks fundamental system requirements, such as root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity` is an idempotent function that orchestrates directory creation, FEMK (File Encryption Master Key) resolution, `fscrypt` setup, and the encryption of target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs` securely unlocks encrypted directories, returning an `errIntegrityCompromised` on failure.
        *   `getFsKey` securely retrieves the FEMK using a `vault.SecureContainer`, ensuring the plaintext key is safely wiped.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` manages the creation and cleaning of necessary application directories with specific permissions.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` provides warnings for unaddressed data in the recovery directory.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file was introduced or significantly updated to serve as the application's entry point.
    *   It defines `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) to standardize process return values, aligning with `systemd` conventions.
    *   The `main` function parses command-line arguments (e.g., `mountPath`), sets up logging, and calls the `run` function.
    *   The `run` function manages the overall application lifecycle: logging the version, initializing application state, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, processing manifest targets, enabling integrity features, and unlocking encrypted directories. It translates internal errors into appropriate `ExitCode` values.
    *   It uses `//go:embed integrity-handler.version` to embed the application version string directly into the binary.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file was added or updated to provide high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.

    *   `SetupOnMount` is an idempotent function for performing global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` configurations.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the comprehensive outcomes of directory encryption, distinguishing between successes, already encrypted, and various failure scenarios. It includes methods to report overall failure status and construct detailed error messages.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` is the main idempotent function for encrypting multiple target directories.
    *   `encryptTargetDir` details the steps for encrypting a single directory: relocating its contents to a temporary area, recreating the target directory with appropriate permissions, encrypting the new (empty) directory, and incorporating error handling with recovery considerations.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security Focus**: A strong emphasis on security is evident throughout the code, featuring TPM/vTPM integration for key management, secure key handling practices (e.g., wiping plaintext keys), stringent environment checks (root, kernel version, filesystem encryption), and specific error codes for integrity compromises.
*   **Idempotency**: Multiple critical functions (`enableIntegrity`, `SetupOnMount`, `EncryptTargetDirs`) are explicitly designed to be idempotent, ensuring consistent behavior even if called multiple times.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: The code demonstrates comprehensive error handling, utilizing custom error types, `errors.Join` for composite errors, and detailed logging (`log.Debug`, `log.Errorf`, `log.Warnf`). Specific `ExitCode` values provide granular reporting of application status.
*   **Modularity**: The codebase is well-structured into distinct Go packages (`common`, `integrity`, `main`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`, `log`), promoting code organization and reusability.
*   **Filesystem Management**: The `afero` library is used for filesystem abstraction, and specific directory paths (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are consistently used for application data, temporary storage, and recovery.

*   **"TODO" Comments**: Several "TODO" comments exist, particularly in `integrity.go` and `fscrypt.go`, highlighting areas for future improvements or implementation details (e.g., "best effort shred," processing manifest files, refining error handling for recovery directories).

## 3:26:51 AM
The log details development activity for an "Integrity Handler" Go application, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Initial entry at `11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM`. A later update occurred at `11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM`.
    *   **Updates:** The primary change in this file was a clarification of its package comment. It initially described holding keys in a secure container relying on `mmap`'ed and `mlocked` memory, while also containing common variables. The updated comment simplifies this to "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constant directory paths, such as `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`, remained consistent.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries at `11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM`, `11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM`, `11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM`, and `11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM`.
    *   **Updates:** The content of this file appears to be identical across all provided timestamps. It implements the core logic of the Integrity Handler. Key functionalities include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt.CheckSupport`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process by ensuring necessary directories exist, managing the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK) securely, setting up `fscrypt` on the target mount point, and initiating directory encryption.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles the unlocking of encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading mechanism for the filesystem key, which is stored in a secure container and then securely wiped from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and sets permissions for critical directories used for migration, recovery, manifests, and boot files. It also attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks the recovery directory for any lingering files that might indicate a failed migration, issuing warnings for manual intervention.
        *   An `errIntegrityCompromised` error is defined and utilized to specifically flag integrity violations during key decryption or directory unlocking.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM`.

        *   It defines a set of `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with standard systemd service return codes, providing clear process termination status.
        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `-mount` command-line flag, and calls the central `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the entire application flow: logs the handler version, manages an application state, handles recovery directory warnings, verifies the environment (returning `ExitIncompatible` if checks fail), calls `enableIntegrity` to encrypt specified targets (with a `DefaultManifest()` placeholder for future manifest processing), and then `unlockEncryptedDirs` for already encrypted targets. It robustly handles errors, mapping them to the appropriate `ExitCode`s, notably `ExitCompromised` for integrity failures.
        *   Uses `//go:embed` to include a version string from an external file (`integrity-handler.version`).

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM`.
    *   **Updates:** This file introduces a new package `fscrypt` dedicated to abstracting high-level `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines various specific error types to describe different `fscrypt` failure conditions (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`).
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function provides an idempotent mechanism to perform global `fscrypt` setup and then configure `fscrypt` for a specific mount path.
        *   A new `EncryptionResult` struct is introduced to provide a detailed breakdown of the outcome of encryption attempts for multiple directories, distinguishing between successes, already encrypted targets, and various types of failures (relocation, encryption, unlocking, restoration, recovery). It includes helper methods to check for failures and construct comprehensive error messages.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` handles the encryption of a list of target directories, calling `encryptTargetDir` for each.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` implements the core, idempotent logic for encrypting a single directory: it temporarily moves existing contents out, recreates the directory with appropriate permissions, encrypts the now-empty directory, and includes sophisticated error handling with recovery steps (e.g., moving contents to a dedicated recovery directory if encryption fails).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Ownership:** All files consistently include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`, indicating development by Juniper Networks.

    *   The `protectorName` constant is set to "FEMK".
    *   `SetupOnMount`: An idempotent function that performs global `fscrypt` setup and filesystem-specific setup for a given mount path.
    *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct that detailed tracks the outcome of encryption attempts for multiple targets, categorizing them into success, already encrypted, and various failure modes (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, recovery). It includes methods to check for failures and build composite error messages.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: The main function to encrypt a list of target directories. It iterates through targets, checks if they are already encrypted, and calls `encryptTargetDir` for new encryptions. This function is also stated to be idempotent.
    *   `encryptTargetDir`: This internal helper moves directory contents to a temporary location, recreates the target directory as empty with original permissions, encrypts it, and includes logic for recovery if operations fail.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**

*   **Copyright and Versioning:** All files begin with a Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025. The `main.go` file uses `//go:embed` for version management.
*   **Security Focus:** The codebase heavily emphasizes security, particularly filesystem encryption (`fscrypt`), key management (`FEMK`, `vault.SecureContainer`), and hardware-backed security (`tpm`). The concept of "integrity compromised" is a central error state.
*   **Directory Structure and Management:** There's a clear pattern of defining and managing specific directories for application operations, temporary data, and recovery (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`). Functions like `ensureDirectoriesExist` ensure these are properly set up.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code consistently uses Go's `errors.Is` and `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)` for wrapping and propagating errors, allowing for detailed error analysis. Custom error types are also defined for specific failure scenarios, especially in the `fscrypt` package.
*   **Idempotency:** The `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` functions are explicitly designed to be idempotent, indicating a design philosophy for reliable, repeatable operations without side effects on repeated execution.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** Multiple changes to `integrity.go` occurred within very short intervals (seconds to minutes), suggesting rapid development, minor fixes, or frequent saving during a coding session. The `directories.go` file also saw a minor update within a couple of hours.
*   **Dependency on External Libraries:** The project relies on `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption, `github.com/spf13/afero` for filesystem abstraction, and `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` for logging.
