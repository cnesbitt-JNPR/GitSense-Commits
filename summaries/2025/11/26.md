# Activity Summary for 11/26/2025

## 12:26:53 AM
The provided log details changes across the `Integrity Handler` Go application, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file defines constant strings for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files).
    *   **Update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** A minor change occurred, updating the package-level comment to clarify its purpose as containing "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constant directory paths themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM):** This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler application. It includes functions to:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Check system prerequisites (root user, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command availability) and initialize TPM/vTPM.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt`, and initiating directory encryption.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Manages the secure retrieval and storage of the filesystem key using a `vault.SecureContainer`.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and cleans the various directories defined in `common`.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for contents in the recovery directory, logging warnings if found.
    *   **Subsequent timestamps (11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM):** The code content for this file remained functionally identical across these three timestamps, indicating no code changes were made, likely just re-saves or minor non-code modifications.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This is the application's entry point. It sets up logging, parses a `mountPath` command-line argument, and defines custom `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised). The `run` function coordinates the application's flow, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, with comprehensive error handling that maps failures to specific `ExitCode`s. It also embeds and retrieves a version string.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined various error constants related to encryption and file operations, implemented `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup, and introduced the `EncryptionResult` struct to detail the outcomes of encryption attempts (successes, already encrypted, and various failure types including relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, and recover failures). The `EncryptTargetDirs` function orchestrated the encryption of multiple directories, using `encryptTargetDir` to handle the relocation of contents, creation of empty encrypted directories, and subsequent restoration of contents.
    *   **Significant update (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):** This entry shows a substantial refactoring.
        *   **New Error Constants:** `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were explicitly added.
        *   **`EncryptionResult` Refinement:** The `FailedToRecover` field and its associated logic in `Failed()` and `BuildError()` were removed, suggesting a change in how recovery failures are tracked or handled.
        *   **Dependency Reduction:** The `common` package import was removed from this file.
        *   **Hardcoded Path:** The `tempDir` in `EncryptTargetDirs` was changed from using `common.MigrationDirPath` to a hardcoded string `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`.
        *   **Refined Error Handling:** The error handling after calling `encryptTargetDir` in `EncryptTargetDirs` was re-structured using a `switch` statement, leveraging the newly defined specific error types for clearer failure identification.
        *   **Function Signature Change:** The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was updated to explicitly accept `tempDir`, and the internal logic for `recoveryDir` and `migrateToRecoveryDir` was removed, indicating a streamlining or externalization of recovery path management for individual target directories during encryption.
        *   **Cleanup:** A new step was added to `EncryptTargetDirs` to remove the temporary `tempDir` upon successful encryption of a target.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial implementation of the core Integrity Handler logic.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Initial implementation of the `main` application entry point.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: Minor comment update in `common/directories.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of `fscrypt` wrappers and encryption orchestration.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactoring and enhancement of `fscrypt.go`, including error handling, dependency changes, and simplification of recovery tracking within `EncryptionResult`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Copyright Notice:** All files consistently start with `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`.
*   **Logging:** The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is extensively used across all files for debugging, informational messages, warnings, and error reporting (`log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warn`, `log.Errorf`).
*   **Error Handling:** Go's error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("...: %w", ...)`) is consistently used to provide context to errors. The `errors.Is` and `errors.As` functions are employed for structured error checking.
*   **`context.Context`:** A `context.Context` object is passed through many function calls, enabling cancellation or timeout signals throughout the application's operations.
*   **`afero.Fs`:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` package is used for abstracting file system operations, allowing for easier testing and potentially different file system implementations.
*   **Integrity and Security Focus:** The repeated mentions of TPM, FEMK (File Encryption Master Key), secure containers, and fscrypt underscore the application's primary goal of ensuring system and data integrity through encryption.
*   **Idempotency Comments:** Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly marked with comments indicating they "must be idempotent," highlighting a design goal for reliable operation even if executed multiple times.
