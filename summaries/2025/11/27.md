# Activity Summary for 11/27/2025

## 12:26:56 AM
The log details development on Juniper Networks' Integrity Handler, a Go application focused on securing a system through filesystem encryption and integrity verification. The changes span three main files: `common/directories.go`, `integrity.go`, and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, along with the introduction of `main.go`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defines constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `BootDirPath` ("/boot/integrity"), `EncryptedKeyPath` ("/boot/integrity/femk.enc" for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key), `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`. The package comment indicates its role in holding secure keys and common variables.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update was made to the package comment, simplifying its description to "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined directory paths remained unchanged.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM**: This file contains the core logic of the Integrity Handler. Across these four entries, the code content remained identical, suggesting minor save operations without functional changes. Key functionalities include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Ensures the system meets requirements, checking for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`), and TPM/vTPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: An idempotent function responsible for ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving the FEMK, setting up `fscrypt` on the mount point, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking of encrypted directories, deeming failures as an "integrity compromised" state.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function to retrieve the filesystem key securely from a `vault.SecureContainer` after decrypting the FEMK, with explicit memory wiping of the plaintext key.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and manages the permissions for operational directories like migration, recovery, and manifest paths, utilizing constants from the `common` package.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks and logs warnings if the recovery directory contains data, indicating potential issues requiring manual intervention.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This log entry introduces the main application entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised). The `main` function parses command-line arguments (specifically a `mount` path), sets up logging, and orchestrates the application's flow by calling `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It maps errors from these functions to appropriate `ExitCode` values, prominently `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations. It also embeds the application version using `//go:embed`.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file introduces a package for high-level operations leveraging the `fscrypt` library. It defines various specific error types related to encryption (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`). An `EncryptionResult` struct is defined to track the detailed success/failure status of directory encryption, including `FailedToRecover`. The `SetupOnMount` function handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function orchestrates the encryption of multiple directories by relocating their contents, encrypting the empty directory, and then restoring the contents. It explicitly imported the `common` package to reference directory paths.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This is the most significant update in the log.
        *   **Removal of `common` import**: The `fscrypt` package no longer directly imports the `common` package. This leads to `MigrationDirPath` being replaced by a hardcoded path (`"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`) within `EncryptTargetDirs` for temporary directory management.
        *   **Enhanced Error Granularity**: New, explicit error variables `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore` were added, providing more specific failure indications.
        *   **Refactored `EncryptionResult`**: The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and related methods (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`), indicating a streamlined approach to recovery status tracking.
        *   **Improved Error Handling in `EncryptTargetDirs`**: The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to use a `switch` statement to handle the new explicit error types returned by `encryptTargetDir` and now includes cleanup for the temporary migration directory upon successful operations.
        *   **`encryptTargetDir` Signature Change**: The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was modified to accept `tempDir` as an argument, further decoupling it from the `common` package's directory constants. Recovery directory logic in this function appears to be simplified or removed from the provided snippet.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of shared directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial implementation of core Integrity Handler logic.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of the main application entry point and overall operational flow.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of the `fscrypt` wrapper package.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, indicating a design decision to remove direct `common` package dependency for path constants within the `fscrypt` logic, and to introduce more granular error handling.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright and Authorship**: All files consistently include a "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." header.
*   **Robust Logging**: Extensive use of a custom `log` package (e.g., `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Error`, `log.Warnf`) for detailed operational tracing, error reporting, and warnings.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Go's standard error handling patterns, including `fmt.Errorf` for wrapping errors with context, and `errors.Is`/`errors.As`/`errors.Join` for sophisticated error comparison and composition, are widely used. Specific custom error types are defined to categorize different failure scenarios.
*   **Secure Operations**: A strong emphasis on security and integrity, highlighted by the use of TPM initialization, a `vault.SecureContainer` for key management, and the `fscrypt` library for filesystem encryption. The concept of "integrity compromised" is a critical state explicitly handled.
*   **Idempotency**: Several functions, like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly designed to be idempotent to ensure consistent behavior on repeated execution.
*   **Standardized Directory Paths**: The application relies on a set of standardized directory paths (e.g., for boot, migration, recovery, manifests), initially defined in `common/directories.go`, though the `fscrypt` package later hardcoded one of these paths directly.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `afero.Fs` interface is used for filesystem operations, which typically facilitates testing and potentially supports different filesystem implementations.
*   **Future Work (`TODO` comments)**: Several `// TODO` comments indicate planned enhancements, such as better shredding for temporary data, more comprehensive path handling for upgrades, and manifest processing.

## 1:26:51 AM
The Integrity Handler application, written in Go, focuses on securing filesystems through encryption using the `fscrypt` library, with support for TPM/vTPM for key management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of constants for critical directory paths: `/boot/integrity` (boot directory), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (encrypted FEMK path), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (migration store), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (recovery directory), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (manifest files).
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor textual update to the package-level comment, changing it from a detailed description of the secure container to a more general "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM**: This file, implementing the core Integrity Handler logic, was logged multiple times with identical content. It includes functions for verifying environment requirements (root, kernel >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command, TPM initialization), enabling and unlocking integrity, managing the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK) using a secure vault, and ensuring necessary directories (defined in `common`) exist and are cleaned/checked. `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` specifically checks the recovery directory for unaddressed issues. No code changes were observed across these four timestamps for this file.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This new file was introduced as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for process termination status. The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path command-line argument, and orchestrates the integrity process by calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It maps any errors from these functions to the appropriate `ExitCode`. The file also uses `//go:embed` to include a version string.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined various error conditions specific to encryption, set a `protectorName` ("FEMK"), and provided `SetupOnMount` and `EncryptTargetDirs` functions. The `EncryptionResult` struct was introduced to track success and various failure modes (relocation, encryption, unlocking, restoration, recovery). The `encryptTargetDir` function detailed the steps: moving contents to a temporary location (using `common.MigrationDirPath`), recreating the target directory as empty, encrypting it, and then restoring contents.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This update represents a significant refactoring:
        *   The dependency on the `common` package was removed from this file.
        *   New, more specific error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was updated to remove `FailedToRecover`, and its `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were adjusted accordingly.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was modified: it now hardcodes the temporary migration path (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`) instead of using the `common.MigrationDirPath` constant. It also introduced a `switch` statement to handle different error types returned by `encryptTargetDir` more explicitly, and now explicitly removes the temporary migration directory upon successful encryption.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function was refactored to accept the `tempDir` as an argument and no longer directly manages a `recoveryDir`, simplifying its internal error handling regarding content migration.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of `main.go`, marking the application's top-level execution flow and error code definitions.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of `fscrypt.go`, establishing the core encryption and file migration logic.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A major refactor in `fscrypt.go`, removing a dependency on the `common` package, introducing more granular error types, and streamlining the error handling and temporary file management within the encryption process.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notices**: All files start with the Juniper Networks copyright for 2025.
*   **Consistent Logging**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is widely used across all files for structured debugging, informational, warning, and error messages.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: The codebase demonstrates a strong emphasis on detailed error handling, using `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.Join` to propagate and categorize errors. Specific exit codes are defined in `main.go` for various failure scenarios.
*   **Fscrypt Integration**: The core purpose revolves around integrating with `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, with explicit checks for kernel and filesystem support.
*   **Idempotency Requirement**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly documented as needing to be idempotent, ensuring they can be run multiple times without unintended side effects.
*   **Dedicated Directory Structure**: The application consistently relies on a set of well-defined directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, etc.) for its operations, emphasizing organized storage of keys, manifests, and temporary data.

## 2:26:52 AM
The provided log details changes to an Integrity Handler application written in Go, focusing on secure filesystem encryption, particularly using `fscrypt` and TPM. The timestamps show most activity on November 21, 2025, with a distinct update to the `fscrypt` package on November 25, 2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**
        *   Initial definition of global constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` (for handler files), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data during fscrypt initialization), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for data recovery post-migration failure), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for integrity manifests).
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**
        *   A minor update was made to the package-level comment, clarifying its purpose as holding "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The actual directory constants remain unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**
        *   This file imports core libraries for context management, error handling, process execution, filesystem operations (using `afero`), and security components like `fscrypt`, `tpm`, and `vault`.
        *   It defines `errIntegrityCompromised` for specific error conditions.
        *   Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` which checks system prerequisites (root user, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization).
        *   `enableIntegrity` orchestrates the encryption process: ensuring directories exist, resolving the FEMK, setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs` handles unlocking encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey` manages the secure loading of the FEMK into a `vault.SecureContainer` and explicitly wipes the plain key from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates the necessary application directories with specific permissions and includes logic to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` is present to check for and warn about existing content in the recovery directory.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM and 2:40:35 PM**
        *   These entries show no functional changes to the code, indicating potential reformatting or minor metadata updates without content alteration.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM**
        *   A minor change occurred in `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`. The explicit `afero.Exists` check for `common.RecoveryDirPath` was removed, meaning the function now directly attempts to read the directory and logs a warning if it fails, rather than checking for existence first.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**
        *   This is the application's entry point, defining `main()` and `run()`.
        *   It sets up logging, parses a `mount` path flag, and defines custom `ExitCode` constants reflecting different application outcomes (success, failure, incompatible environment, integrity compromised).
        *   The `run` function coordinates the execution flow: retrieving the application version, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes comprehensive error handling, mapping specific integrity-related failures to the `ExitCompromised` status.
        *   It uses `//go:embed` to embed the `integrity-handler.version` string.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**
        *   This file provides high-level Go wrappers for interacting with `fscrypt` functionality.
        *   It defines numerous specific error types for scenarios like an already encrypted target, non-empty destination, source/destination non-existence, and failures during relocation, fscrypt setup, or encryption support checks.
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function performs global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup.
        *   An `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the status of encryption attempts for multiple targets (successes, already encrypted, various failure types). Methods like `Failed()` and `BuildError()` aid in summarizing these results.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` iterates through target directories, checking for existing encryption before calling `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` details the steps for encrypting a single directory: relocating its contents to a temporary directory, recreating the target directory as empty, encrypting the empty directory, and handling various error conditions during this process.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**
        *   This update introduces several key changes to the `fscrypt` package.
        *   The import of `common` package was removed, suggesting a refactoring to reduce direct dependencies.
        *   New explicit error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added to the package.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and associated methods (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`) were updated to remove tracking for `FailedToRecover`, simplifying the error reporting.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was significantly refactored:
            *   It now passes the `tempDir` directly to `encryptTargetDir`.
            *   The `tempDir` path is now hardcoded within the `fscrypt` package (`"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`), aligning with the removal of the `common` import.
            *   A `switch` statement was added to specifically log different types of failures returned by `encryptTargetDir`.
            *   Upon successful encryption, it now includes logic to `fs.RemoveAll(tempDir)` to clean up the temporary migration directory.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was updated to accept `tempDir` as an argument, and internal handling of `dirName` and `recoveryDir` variables was changed, including the removal of the `migrateToRecoveryDir` call from the visible snippet.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial constants for directory paths (`common/directories.go`).
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** Core logic for Integrity Handler, environment verification, encryption, and directory management (`integrity.go`).
*   **11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM:** Minor adjustment in `integrity.go`'s `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` (removed `Exists` check).
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** Application entry point and orchestration (`main.go`).
*   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** Minor comment update in `common/directories.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** Initial `fscrypt` wrapper implementation (`fscrypt/fscrypt.go`).
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** Significant refactoring and error handling improvements in `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, including dependency reduction and explicit cleanup.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright:** All files begin with `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`, indicating ownership and a consistent project context.
*   **Integrity Handler Focus:** The code is consistently described as part of an "Integrity Handler application," suggesting a core function of ensuring data integrity, primarily through filesystem encryption.
*   **Security Emphasis:** Recurring themes include using `fscrypt` for encryption, `tpm` for key management, `vault.SecureContainer` for holding keys securely, and explicit memory wiping of plain keys (`wipe the original slice to be safe`). Error conditions related to "integrity compromised" are also prominent.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code extensively uses Go's `errors` package features (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Is`, `errors.As`, `errors.Join`) for detailed and structured error reporting. Custom error types are also defined in `fscrypt.go`.
*   **Directory-Based Operations:** There's a strong pattern of defining and managing specific directories for application files, migration, recovery, and manifests (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/`).
*   **Idempotency:** Specific functions (`enableIntegrity`, `EncryptTargetDirs`) are explicitly commented as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for reliable operation even if executed multiple times.
*   **Logging:** The use of a `log` package (e.g., `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warnf`, `log.Errorf`) is pervasive across all files for debugging and operational insights.
*   **Go Modules and Structures:** Consistent use of Go standard library imports and common patterns for structuring Go applications (e.g., packages, constants, functions with context, error returns).

## 3:26:52 AM
The codebase represents an "Integrity Handler" application in Go, primarily focused on enforcing configuration integrity through filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and utilizing TPM/vTPM for key management. Development activity spans November 21st and 25th, 2025, indicating an initial setup followed by refinements.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of several constant paths crucial for the Integrity Handler's operation. These include `/boot/integrity` for core files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), and dedicated paths under `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration data, recovery data, and integrity manifest files.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update to the package-level comment, clarifying its purpose to contain "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," while the defined constants remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** (and subsequent entries at 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM with identical content): This file contains the core business logic. It establishes functions for:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like running as root, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem fscrypt support, availability of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM/vTPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: An idempotent function that prepares the environment (ensuring directories exist), manages the FEMK (creation and retrieval), sets up fscrypt on the target mount, and initiates encryption of specified directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories, treating failures as integrity compromises.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading mechanism to decrypt the FEMK and store it securely in a `vault.SecureContainer`.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates all necessary application directories with appropriate permissions and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if the recovery directory contains data, indicating a potential need for manual intervention.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants (0 for success, 1 for generic failure, 6 for incompatible environment, 78 for integrity compromised) aligning with systemd service return codes. The `main` function parses command-line arguments (specifically a `mount` path), sets up logging, and invokes the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the primary workflow: version logging, `appState` initialization, recovery warning checks, environment verification, enabling integrity, and unlocking directories, with comprehensive error handling to map specific issues to the defined `ExitCode` values.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines several `Err` constants for specific failure scenarios related to encryption, relocation, and mount support. Key components include:
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Performs global and mount-specific fscrypt setup.
        *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct designed to provide a detailed breakdown of encryption outcomes for multiple target directories, categorizing successes, already encrypted paths, and various types of failures (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, recovery).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through a list of directories, orchestrating their encryption.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: This core function handles the encryption of a single directory by temporarily relocating its contents, encrypting the now-empty directory, and then moving the contents back. It includes initial error handling and a placeholder for recovery actions.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Introduced significant refinements:
        *   **Dependency Removal**: The import of the `common` package was removed.
        *   **Error Definition Enhancement**: New and more granular error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added, and the `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by removing `FailedToRecover`.
        *   **Encryption Logic Refinement**: The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to construct temporary directory paths directly (e.g., using a hardcoded `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/` prefix) instead of relying on constants from the removed `common` package. Error handling was made more precise using `errors.Is`, and a cleanup step was added to remove temporary migration directories upon successful encryption. The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was also updated to explicitly accept the `tempDir` path.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Integrity-Centric Design**: The entire application is built around the concept of "Integrity Handler," with specific mechanisms (fscrypt, TPM, secure containers) to ensure system and data integrity, and explicit error handling for "integrity compromised" states.
*   **Idempotency**: Key operations, particularly `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are designed to be idempotent, allowing them to be safely rerun without unintended side effects.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Recovery**: The codebase features extensive custom error types, detailed error reporting through the `EncryptionResult` struct, and mechanisms for identifying and warning about potential data loss (e.g., contents in recovery directories). Exit codes are carefully mapped to reflect different failure categories.
*   **Modular Architecture**: The project is structured into distinct Go packages (`common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`, `log`), promoting code organization and separation of concerns.
*   **Consistent Logging**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is used uniformly for logging debug, informational, warning, and error messages across all components.
*   **Copyright and Ownership**: All code files include a consistent `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` notice.
*   **Version Control:** The repeated identical `integrity.go` entries timestamped 11/21/2025 suggest either repetitive saves without changes or perhaps a source control system logging identical content for minor non-functional actions, indicating a period of stability in that particular file's logic before the `main.go` and `fscrypt.go` changes.
*   **Path Definition**: The `common/directories.go` file acts as a central location for defining important filesystem paths, although a later change in `fscrypt.go` moved away from importing it for some path constructions.

## 4:26:58 AM
The log details development of an "Integrity Handler" application in Go, primarily focused on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM integration, within the Juniper SSR ecosystem. The changes span two distinct dates: November 21, 2025, and November 25, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially defined, establishing constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` for core files and the encrypted FEMK (File Encryption Master Key), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` subdirectories for migration data (`.migration-store`), recovery data (`migration-recovery`), and integrity manifests (`manifest.d`).
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update occurred, changing the package comment to a more general "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," clarifying its purpose without altering any of the defined directory constants.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**:
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: This file shows multiple identical entries. The content defines the core logic of the Integrity Handler. Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` which checks system requirements (root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, fscrypt support, TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` for setting up encryption, `unlockEncryptedDirs` for accessing encrypted content, and `getFsKey` for securely managing the filesystem key. It also includes `ensureDirectoriesExist` to create and clean necessary application directories, and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to alert on data found in recovery directories. Despite multiple timestamps, no functional code changes are observed across these entries.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This new file introduces the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It parses command-line flags (e.g., `-mount`), sets up logging, and orchestrates the execution flow by calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It defines specific `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for process return values, aligning with systemd service standards, and embeds a version string.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file was initially introduced, containing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error types related to encryption failures and relocation issues. Key functions `SetupOnMount` prepare the filesystem for encryption, and `EncryptTargetDirs` manages the process of encrypting specified directories. An `EncryptionResult` struct is used to track the success or failure of encryption and relocation for multiple targets, including handling already encrypted directories and recovering from relocation issues. This initial version explicitly imported the `common` package.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This file underwent significant revisions. The import of the `common` package was removed. Correspondingly, hardcoded paths for temporary directories (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`) replaced references to `common.MigrationDirPath`. The `EncryptionResult` struct was refined by removing the `FailedToRecover` field, and new specific error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced, formalizing error handling. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was refactored to directly handle individual encryption failures with a `switch` statement for specific error types and to ensure cleanup of temporary migration directories on success.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial definition of core Integrity Handler logic.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of the main application entry point and flow.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of `fscrypt` wrapper functions.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactoring and formalization of error handling in the `fscrypt` package, including removal of the `common` package dependency and hardcoding of some paths.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice:** All code snippets consistently include the "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." header, indicating a unified project.
*   **Security Focus:** The entire codebase revolves around integrity, encryption (`fscrypt`), secure key management (`vault`, FEMK), and TPM integration, pointing to a strong emphasis on system security.
*   **Directory Management:** There's a recurring pattern of defining and managing specific system directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/...`) for migration, recovery, and manifest storage.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The Go code demonstrates extensive use of `errors.Join` and custom error types, indicating a design philosophy for comprehensive error reporting and handling.
*   **Idempotency:** Explicit comments emphasize that functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` must be idempotent, suggesting careful design for resilience and safe re-execution.
*   **Duplicate Content:** The multiple identical entries for `integrity.go` on 11/21/2025 suggest either repetitive commits without code changes or a version control process that captures identical snapshots.

## 5:26:49 AM
The log details changes across several Go source files related to an "Integrity Handler" application by Juniper Networks, focused on filesystem encryption and integrity verification.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant strings for key directory paths used by the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and encrypted FEMK), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` for migration, recovery, and manifest data respectively.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update changed the package-level comment from describing the secure container (which the package technically doesn't implement) to accurately state that it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constant definitions themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**, **2:27:22 PM**, **2:28:49 PM**, **2:40:35 PM**: Despite multiple timestamps, the content of this file remained identical across these entries. It implements core logic for the Integrity Handler:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Ensures the system meets requirements (root user, kernel >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support via `fscrypt`, `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization).
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, including creating necessary directories, resolving/decrypting the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function to retrieve the decrypted FEMK securely.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates the various integrity-related directories defined in `common/directories.go` with appropriate permissions and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for existing data in the recovery directory and logs warnings if manual intervention might be needed.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This log entry introduces the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application.
        *   It defines custom `ExitCode` values for success, generic failure, incompatible environment, and integrity compromise.
        *   Uses `//go:embed` to include a version string.
        *   The `main` function parses a `--mount` path argument.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: logging the version, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, and mapping their outcomes to the defined `ExitCode` values. It uses `DefaultManifest()` as a placeholder for target directories.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: The initial version of this file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines numerous `Err` variables for various failure conditions related to encryption (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`).
        *   A `protectorName` constant is set to "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: A detailed structure to report the outcomes of encryption attempts on multiple directories, tracking success, already encrypted, and various failure types (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, recover).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Initiates the encryption process for a list of target directories.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Performs the actual encryption for a single directory, involving moving contents out, recreating the directory as empty, encrypting it, and then moving contents back. This initial version uses paths from the `common` package (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPath`, `common.RecoveryDirPath`).
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This is a significant update to the `fscrypt.go` file:
        *   **Removed dependency**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` import was removed, indicating a decoupling from the `common` package for directory path management within `fscrypt`.
        *   **New Error Variables**: Explicit `var` error constants `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were added for more specific error identification.
        *   **`EncryptionResult` Refinement**: The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods.
        *   **Hardcoded Paths and Recovery Logic Removal**: Within `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir`, the use of `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath` was replaced. Specifically, the migration path was hardcoded as `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`, and the `recoveryDir` concept and related error handling (moving contents to a recovery directory) were entirely removed from the encryption process. Error handling for `encryptTargetDir` now primarily focuses on the `tempDir` (migration store).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of core directory paths (`common/directories.go`).
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Introduction of the main `IntegrityHandler` logic (`integrity.go`).
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of the application's entry point and overall flow (`main.go`).
*   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: Minor comment clarification in `common/directories.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of `fscrypt` wrapper functions for encryption (`fscrypt/fscrypt.go`).
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A major refactoring of `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, removing its direct dependency on the `common` package for certain directory paths and streamlining error/recovery handling within the encryption process. This timestamp is notable for being several days after the other clustered changes on November 21st.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice**: All files begin with the same Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025.
*   **Go Modules and Logging**: The project extensively uses standard Go libraries, `github.com/spf13/afero` for filesystem abstraction, `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption, and a custom `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package for logging.
*   **Security Focus**: The code repeatedly emphasizes security aspects such as TPM initialization, secure key handling (`vault.SecureContainer`), and secure directory permissions (0o750, 0o700).
*   **Error Handling**: There's a consistent pattern of detailed error handling using `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.Join`, often with explicit error types for various failure conditions.
*   **Directory Management**: Specific directory paths under `/boot/integrity` and `/opt/128technology/integrity` are central to the application's operation for storing metadata, migration data, and recovery information.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed or commented as needing to be idempotent.
*   **"Integrity Handler" Application**: The entire codebase revolves around the "Integrity Handler" application, focused on verifying system requirements and enabling/unlocking filesystem encryption.

## 6:26:53 AM
The log details changes across several Go source files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focusing on filesystem encryption and secure key management.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defines key directory paths as constants, such as `/boot/integrity` for boot files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted FEMK (File Encryption Master Key), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` for migration, recovery, and manifest data respectively.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update changes the package comment to accurately describe the `common` package as containing "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," rather than implying it specifically holds secure key containers. The directory constants remain unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This file implements the core logic of the Integrity Handler. It includes functions to `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking for root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support via `fscrypt`, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (which ensures necessary directories exist, creates/retrieves the FEMK, sets up `fscrypt`, and encrypts target directories), and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It utilizes a `vault.SecureContainer` to handle the FEMK securely, wiping the plaintext key from memory after use. The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function handles creating various application directories with specific permissions and includes logic to clean the migration directory.
    *   **Subsequent timestamps (11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 2:28:49 PM; 2:40:35 PM)**: These entries show no functional changes to the file, suggesting minor saves or reformatting without code modifications.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines custom `ExitCode` constants (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with `systemd` service return codes. The `main` function parses a `mountPath` flag, sets up logging, and orchestrates the integrity process by calling environment verification, directory warning handlers, and the `enableIntegrity`/`unlockEncryptedDirs` functions, returning specific exit codes based on the outcome, including an `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`) and a `protectorName` constant "FEMK." Key functions include `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` configuration, and `EncryptTargetDirs`. The `encryptTargetDir` function implements a multi-step process: migrating contents out of the target to a temporary directory (using `common.MigrationDirPath`), recreating the target as an empty directory, encrypting it, and handling recovery if encryption or relocation fails.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This is a significant update. It explicitly defines new error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) and removes the `FailedToRecover` field and associated logic from the `EncryptionResult` struct. Crucially, in `EncryptTargetDirs`, the temporary directory path (`tempDir`) is now hardcoded as `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/" + dirName`, replacing the use of `common.MigrationDirPath`. Consequently, the `common` package import is removed from this file. The `encryptTargetDir` function also removes its recovery directory handling, streamlining the error reporting and cleanup in `EncryptTargetDirs`.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of system-critical directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Introduction of core integrity application logic, including environment checks, encryption flow, and secure key handling.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Establishment of the application's entry point, argument parsing, and structured exit codes.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Implementation of detailed `fscrypt` integration, including file relocation and encryption steps.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refinement of `fscrypt` error handling, removal of recovery logic within `fscrypt.go`, and a notable change to use a hardcoded migration path instead of a common constant, impacting modularity.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright Information**: All files consistently include a Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025.
*   **Security Focus**: The overall codebase demonstrates a strong emphasis on system integrity and security, leveraging TPM, `fscrypt` for encryption, and secure key handling via a `vault` package.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Go's error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`) and `errors.Join` are used extensively to provide detailed error contexts. Specific custom error types are defined for various failure scenarios.
*   **Directory Standardization**: Key application directories are defined as constants and managed with specific permissions, ensuring a consistent and secure file structure.
*   **Idempotency**: Operations like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent, allowing them to be run multiple times safely.
*   **Logging**: A common `log` package is used across files for consistent debug, info, warn, and error reporting.
*   **Module Interaction**: The `integrity.go` and `main.go` files act as orchestrators, calling functions from specialized packages like `common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, and `vault`.
*   **Evolution of Migration Path Handling**: There's a pattern of defining migration paths in `common/directories.go`, but the latest `fscrypt.go` change deviates from this by hardcoding a migration path, indicating a potential architectural shift or temporary change in how this specific path is managed.

## 7:26:47 AM
The log details development activities for an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity verification. The timestamps indicate activity primarily on November 21st, 2025, with a final update on November 25th, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go:**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** This file defines several constant directory paths critical for the Integrity Handler's operation, including `BootDirPath` (`/boot/integrity`), `EncryptedKeyPath` (`/boot/integrity/femk.enc`), `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`. These paths are used for storing handler files, encrypted keys, migration data, recovery data, and integrity manifests, respectively.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** A minor update occurred, changing the package comment from a detailed description of secure container and common variables to a more concise `// Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler.` The constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go:**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 2:27:22 PM; 2:28:49 PM; 2:40:35 PM:** This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler application.
        *   It imports several packages for context handling, error management, OS interaction, path manipulation, `fscrypt` integration, TPM communication, secure vault operations, and logging.
        *   Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, which checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity` handles the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving a "FEMK" (Filesystem Encryption Master Key), setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs` is responsible for unlocking previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey` securely retrieves the filesystem key.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates all required directories with appropriate permissions and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` checks for and logs warnings about contents found in the recovery directory, suggesting manual intervention may be needed.
        *   Notably, the entries at 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, and 2:40:35 PM show no discernible code changes, suggesting multiple saves or incidental updates without content modification.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go:**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** This file serves as the application's entry point.
        *   It defines custom `ExitCode` values for various outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) to align with systemd service return codes.
        *   The `main` function sets the log level, parses a `mount` path flag, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: logging the version, initializing application state, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes error handling to return appropriate `ExitCode` values based on the outcome of these operations.
        *   It uses `//go:embed` to embed the `integrity-handler.version` string.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go:**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** This file provides wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines numerous custom `Err` constants for various error conditions encountered during encryption and directory manipulation (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`).
        *   `protectorName` is defined as "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount` handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup, designed to be idempotent.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the success and different failure categories for encryption.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` orchestrates the encryption of multiple target directories, checking for pre-existing encryption.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` is a crucial helper function that relocates contents, recreates the target directory, encrypts it, and includes logic for moving contents to a recovery directory in case of failure.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** This timestamp marks a significant refactoring of the `fscrypt.go` file.
        *   New specific error types `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were added to the `var` block.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its related `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated to remove tracking for `FailedToRecover`.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was modified:
            *   The `common` import was removed, and the `tempDir` path was hardcoded within `EncryptTargetDirs`, rather than being constructed using `common.MigrationDirPath`.
            *   Error handling after `encryptTargetDir` now uses a `switch` statement to categorize failures and attempts to remove the temporary directory (`tempDir`) upon success.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function signature changed to accept `tempDir` as an argument, and internal logic for generating `tempDir` and `recoveryDir` using `common` package constants was removed. This suggests a shift in how these temporary and recovery paths are managed, potentially centralizing their definition or calculation outside this specific function, though the accompanying removal of `migrateToRecoveryDir` calls leaves a `TODO` comment hinting at incomplete recovery logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Package Structure:** All Go files consistently begin with a Juniper Networks copyright notice and define their package (e.g., `main`, `common`, `fscrypt`).
*   **Context Passing:** `context.Context` is consistently used as the first argument in many functions, indicating a pattern for managing request-scoped data, deadlines, and cancellation.
*   **Logging:** The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is widely used for debugging, informational messages, warnings, and errors throughout the code.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code exhibits a pattern of detailed error handling using `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` for wrapping errors, and `errors.Is`/`errors.As` for checking specific error types. Composite errors are built in `EncryptionResult.BuildError()`.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` package is used for filesystem operations, allowing for easier testing and abstraction from the underlying OS filesystem.
*   **Idempotency:** Explicit comments in `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` indicate a design goal of ensuring these functions can be called multiple times without adverse effects.
*   **Integrity and Encryption Focus:** The entire codebase revolves around "Config Integrity" and uses `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, leveraging TPM for key management (`FEMK`).
*   **Directory Management:** Specific directories for integrity files, encrypted keys, migration, recovery, and manifests are defined and managed (`ensureDirectoriesExist`).
*   **Version Embedding:** The `main.go` file uses `//go:embed` to embed a version string, a common practice for Go applications.
*   **Refactoring and TODOs:** The changes in `fscrypt.go` and various comments like `// TODO:` suggest ongoing development and planned enhancements, particularly around error handling, recovery, and idempotent flows.
*   **Repetitive Content:** The `integrity.go` file appears in the log multiple times without code changes, which could indicate frequent saving without modification during a development session.

## 8:26:54 AM
The log details changes across several Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focused on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM integration. All code entries share a "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." notice and extensively use `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` for output and `github.com/spf13/afero` for filesystem abstraction. Error handling consistently uses `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf` with wrapping, and `errors.Is`. Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of key directory constants: `BootDirPath` ("/boot/integrity"), `EncryptedKeyPath` ("/boot/integrity/femk.enc"), `MigrationDirPath` ("/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store"), `RecoveryDirPath` ("/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery"), and `ManifestDirPath` ("/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d"). These paths are crucial for the Integrity Handler's operation, especially for key storage and data migration/recovery.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update to the package-level comment, clarifying its purpose as containing "common globals" rather than detailing the secure container aspect. The actual constants remained unchanged.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM**: This file remained consistent across these timestamps. It outlines the core logic of the Integrity Handler, including:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements such as being run as root, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata.CheckSupport`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization (via `tpm.InitializeTPM`).
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Manages the encryption process by ensuring directories exist, resolving/decrypting the FEMK (File Encryption Master Key), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories, with failures treated as integrity compromises.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function for the filesystem key, which also securely wipes the plain key from memory after use.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates the various integrity-related directories defined in `common/directories.go` with specific permissions and cleans the `MigrationDirPath`.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks the `RecoveryDirPath` for any contents that might indicate a failed migration requiring manual intervention.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the main entry point for the application.
        *   It defines custom `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with `systemd` and BSD return codes for robust process management.
        *   The `main` function parses a `mount` path argument, then calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application's lifecycle, including version logging, handling recovery warnings, environment verification, enabling integrity, and unlocking encrypted directories. It maps different error types to specific `ExitCode` values.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation providing high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines several error variables (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`).
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct is introduced to track the status (success, already encrypted, various failures) of multiple directory encryption attempts.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` iterates through target directories, checks if they're already encrypted, and calls `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` outlines the process: relocate contents to a temporary directory (`MigrationDirPath`), recreate the target directory, encrypt it, and then potentially restore contents. It also included logic to move contents to a `RecoveryDirPath` if encryption failed.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This marks a significant refactoring of the `fscrypt` package:
        *   The import of `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` was **removed**. This caused the `tempDir` path within `EncryptTargetDirs` to be hardcoded, rather than referencing `common.MigrationDirPath`.
        *   New top-level error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were explicitly declared.
        *   The `FailedToRecover` field was **removed** from the `EncryptionResult` struct, simplifying failure tracking.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to capture specific errors returned by `encryptTargetDir` and handle them using a `switch` statement, including removal of temporary migration directories upon success.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature changed to return an `error` and accept `tempDir` as an argument. The internal logic for moving contents to a recovery directory (`migrateToRecoveryDir`) and its associated complex error handling (as seen in the earlier timestamp) was **removed** from the provided snippet, indicating a simplification or delegation of recovery logic.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of core directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial full implementation of the `integrity.go` logic.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of the `main.go` file, establishing the application's entry point and high-level flow.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of the `fscrypt` wrapper, detailing encryption and migration steps.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A major refactor in `fscrypt.go`, involving removal of the `common` import, introduction of specific error types, and significant changes to error handling and recovery logic within the encryption process. This timestamp represents a shift in how temporary and recovery directories are managed within the `fscrypt` package.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security-Centric Design**: The consistent use of "Integrity Handler," "FEMK," "TPM," and `fscrypt` throughout the code underscores a core focus on ensuring data integrity and security through encryption and hardware trust.
*   **Structured Error Handling**: A clear pattern of defining specific error variables, wrapping errors with context, and using `errors.Is` for type-checking errors is evident. The change in `fscrypt.go` to introduce more specific error types reinforces this.
*   **Idempotent Operations**: The explicit mention of idempotency for functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` indicates a design principle aimed at robustness and re-runnability.
*   **Directory Management**: The reliance on `common/directories.go` for centralizing path definitions is a pattern, though it was broken in the later `fscrypt.go` change where a path was hardcoded instead.
*   **Extensive Logging**: Detailed `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warnf`, and `log.Errorf` calls are pervasive, facilitating debugging and operational monitoring.

## 9:26:49 AM
The code changes primarily focus on the "Integrity Handler" application, written in Go, which appears to manage secure filesystem encryption using `fscrypt`, a TPM/vTPM, and a secure key vault. The development spans from November 21st to November 25th, 2025, with several iterations on the core logic and a significant refactoring of the `fscrypt` integration.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines essential constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `BootDirPath`, `EncryptedKeyPath`, `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`. These paths indicate where critical integrity-related files and temporary data are stored. The initial comment mentions using anonymous mmap'ed memory for secure key handling, which aligns with the application's security focus.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: Only a minor comment change occurred, rephrasing the package description from "secure container... as well as common variables" to "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," with no functional code changes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 2:27:22 PM; 2:28:49 PM; 2:40:35 PM**: This file contains the main logic for the Integrity Handler. It imports packages for `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`, and `common` utilities. Key functions include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Ensures the system meets requirements (root user, Linux kernel >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command availability, TPM initialization).
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, including creating necessary directories, resolving a File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Retrieves the FEMK from a secure container.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and optionally cleans application-specific directories.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for data in recovery directories, indicating potential past failures requiring manual intervention.
    *   There were no functional code changes in this file across the 2:27-2:40 PM timestamps.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point. It defines custom `ExitCode` constants for systemd service compatibility (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`). It embeds the application version using `//go:embed`. The `main` function parses a `mount` path argument and calls the `run` function, which in turn orchestrates the environment verification, integrity enablement, and directory unlocking, handling errors and returning specific exit codes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: The initial version of this file implements high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error types related to encryption failures, relocation issues, and `fscrypt` support. It introduces `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup, and `EncryptTargetDirs` which manages the encryption of multiple directories, tracking success and various failure states in an `EncryptionResult` struct. At this point, it relies on the `common` package for constructing temporary directory paths. The `encryptTargetDir` function outlines the process of moving contents out, recreating an empty encrypted directory, and then moving contents back.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This update represents a significant refactoring:
        *   **Decoupling from `common` package**: The import of `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` is removed. This implies that path constants previously sourced from `common` are now either hardcoded or passed as arguments to functions within `fscrypt.go`. Specifically, `tempDir` in `EncryptTargetDirs` is now hardcoded.
        *   **Enhanced Error Granularity**: New, more specific error types `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore` are introduced, providing clearer failure indications.
        *   **Streamlined Recovery Tracking**: The `FailedToRecover` field is removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated logic in `Failed()` and `BuildError()`. This suggests a change in how recovery failures are reported or managed.
        *   **Refined `EncryptTargetDirs` logic**: The function now includes a `switch` statement to handle distinct error types returned by `encryptTargetDir`, allowing for more specific logging and actions based on the type of failure. On success, `tempDir` is explicitly removed.
        *   **`encryptTargetDir` signature and internal changes**: The `tempDir` is now passed as an argument to `encryptTargetDir`, reinforcing the decoupling. The internal construction of `recoveryDir` is also removed, aligning with the `EncryptionResult` changes. The handling of moving contents to a recovery directory during `MkdirAll` failure is also removed or altered.

*   **Focus on Security and Integrity**: Key themes across files include filesystem encryption (`fscrypt`), secure key storage (`vault`), TPM interaction (`tpm`), and integrity checks, suggesting a robust security solution.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: The code extensively uses Go's `errors` package, including `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.As` for structured error creation, wrapping, and inspection.
*   **Logging**: The `log` package (presumably `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) is heavily utilized with various levels (`Debug`, `Info`, `Warnf`, `Errorf`) for reporting application state and issues.
*   **Idempotency**: The `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` functions are explicitly designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects.
*   **Directory Management**: A pattern of defining and creating specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, etc.) with careful permission handling is observed.
*   **Timed Development Spurts**: Most changes occurred on November 21st, 2025, indicating focused development, with a significant follow-up refactoring of the `fscrypt` component on November 25th, 2025.

## 10:26:52 AM
The provided log details changes across several Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file defined constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `/boot/integrity` for boot files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), and various `/opt/128technology/integrity/` paths for migration, recovery, and manifest storage.
    *   **Latest state (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** A minor textual change occurred in the package-level comment, clarifying its purpose from "Package container common a secure container to hold our key at runtime..." to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." All defined directory path constants remained identical.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Multiple timestamps (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 2:27:22 PM; 2:28:49 PM; 2:40:35 PM):** This file contains the core logic of the Integrity Handler. It implements functions for verifying environment requirements (e.g., root user, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, fscrypt command, TPM initialization), enabling and unlocking encrypted directories, and managing the FEMK securely in memory. A small, subtle change was introduced at 2:28:49 PM within the `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings()` function, removing an explicit `afero.Exists` check before attempting to read the recovery directory, relying on `afero.ReadDir` to return an error if the directory doesn't exist. Otherwise, the content remained largely stable across these timestamps.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Initial and only state (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This file serves as the application's entry point. It handles command-line argument parsing (specifically a `mountPath`), embeds the application version, sets up logging, and orchestrates the primary workflow by calling functions like `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It defines specific `ExitCode` values for different application outcomes, including `ExitIncompatible` and `ExitCompromised`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file provided high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined numerous error types, `SetupOnMount` for configuring `fscrypt` on a mount point, and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track encryption successes and various failures. The `encryptTargetDir` function implemented a strategy of moving target directory contents to a temporary location (`MigrationDirPath`), recreating and encrypting the empty target directory, and then moving the contents back. It included logic for recovering failed migrations to a dedicated `RecoveryDirPath`. It imported the `common` package to reference directory paths.
    *   **Latest state (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):** Significant changes were made. New, more specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added. The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by removing the `FailedToRecover` field, and its associated `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated accordingly. Crucially, the import of the `common` package was removed. Consequently, paths like `MigrationDirPath` were hardcoded within `EncryptTargetDirs` (e.g., `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`). The recovery logic involving `RecoveryDirPath` and `migrateToRecoveryDir` within `encryptTargetDir` was completely removed, simplifying the error handling flow to focus on relocation, encryption, unlock, and restore failures, with cleanup of temporary migration folders on success. The `encryptTargetDir` function signature was also updated to explicitly take the temporary directory path as an argument.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** Introduction of the core integrity logic in `integrity.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** Introduction of the `main.go` entry point, establishing the overall application flow.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** Initial implementation of detailed `fscrypt` integration, including a relocation-encryption-restore process and recovery mechanisms.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** Major refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, specifically removing a dependency on the `common` package for directory paths, simplifying error reporting, and eliminating the recovery directory fallback logic during encryption.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Ownership:** All files consistently include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Logging:** The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is extensively used across all components for consistent output of debug, info, warning, and error messages.
*   **Error Handling:** A robust error handling pattern is observed, utilizing `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` for wrapping errors, and `errors.Is`/`errors.As` for checking specific error types.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` package is consistently employed for filesystem operations, likely to enable easier testing and platform-independent file management.
*   **Security and Integrity Focus:** The overarching theme is system integrity, involving `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, TPM (Trusted Platform Module) for key management, and secure containers for handling sensitive keys.
*   **Standardized Directory Structure:** Several fixed directory paths under `/boot/integrity` and `/opt/128technology/integrity` are defined and referenced, indicating a clear, structured approach for where the Integrity Handler stores its data and operational files.
*   **Idempotency:** The importance of idempotency is noted for key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, indicating that these operations should yield the same result regardless of how many times they are run with the same inputs.

    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update occurred, changing the package-level comment from describing a "secure container to hold our key" to a more general "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined constants remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This is the core logic file for the Integrity Handler. It includes functions to:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Check system prerequisites like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata`), availability of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrate the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, handling the FEMK (creation and retrieval), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and initiating directory encryption.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlock previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Securely load and decrypt the FEMK into a `vault.SecureContainer`, then wipe the plain key from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Create required directories with appropriate permissions and clean up migration paths.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Log warnings if data is found in recovery directories.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**, **11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM**, **11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: No functional code changes were introduced in these subsequent entries for this file. These timestamps likely represent minor, non-functional saves or re-commits of the same content.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This new file introduces the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines `ExitCode` constants for different program outcomes (success, generic failure, incompatible environment, integrity compromised). The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path argument, and calls the `run` function, which orchestrates the calls to `integrity.go`'s functions like `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It also handles version embedding and maps errors to specific exit codes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This new file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error types related to encryption failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), a `protectorName` constant ("FEMK"), and the `SetupOnMount` function for `fscrypt` setup. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function is central, handling the relocation of directory contents, recreation of empty encrypted directories, and tracking the results in an `EncryptionResult` struct.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This entry shows significant refactoring.
        *   The import of the `common` package was removed. Consequently, the `MigrationDirPath` was hardcoded within `EncryptTargetDirs` (to `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`).
        *   New, more specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its related methods (`Failed()`, `BuildError()`) were updated to remove the tracking of `FailedToRecover`.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was changed to accept `tempDir` as an argument, and its logic for setting directory permissions was simplified to a default `0o0750`, no longer attempting to read existing permissions.
        *   Error handling within `EncryptTargetDirs` was enhanced with a `switch` statement for specific error types, and a cleanup step to remove temporary migration directories on success was added.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice**: All Go files consistently include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`.

*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used to abstract filesystem operations, allowing for more flexible and testable code.
*   **Security Focus**: The consistent use of terms like "Integrity Handler," "encrypted FEMK," "TPM initialization," `vault.SecureContainer`, and `fscrypt` demonstrates a strong emphasis on system integrity and data encryption.
*   **Directory Management**: Specific directory paths, defined as constants, are central to the application's operation, including `/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`. These directories are created, cleaned, and monitored with specific permissions.
*   **Idempotency**: Comments explicitly highlight the requirement for certain functions, such as `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, to be idempotent.
*   **"TODO" Comments**: Several "TODO" comments indicate areas slated for future development or improvement, such as better data shredding, manifest processing, and incorporating more dynamic path handling.

## 1:26:47 PM
The provided log details code changes for an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, primarily focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity validation. All files are copyrighted to Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025.

    *   It uses `//go:embed` to include the application version.
    *   The `run` function initializes logging, handles command-line arguments (like `-mount`), calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, performs environment verification (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), retrieves target directories (via `DefaultManifest`), and then executes the encryption (`enableIntegrity`) and unlocking (`unlockEncryptedDirs`) processes. It maps specific errors to the defined exit codes, particularly `ExitIncompatible` and `ExitCompromised`.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file implements high-level Go wrappers around `fscrypt` operations.
    *   It defines various error constants, such as `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, and errors related to `fscrypt` support on a mount.
    *   `SetupOnMount`: Handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup for a given mount path, ensuring idempotency.
    *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct to track the detailed outcome of encryption attempts for multiple directories (e.g., `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, `FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRestore`, `FailedToRecover`). It includes methods to check for failures and build composite error messages.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: An idempotent function that iterates through target directories, encrypting them if not already encrypted by calling `encryptTargetDir`. The original contents are temporarily moved out, the directory is recreated empty and encrypted, and then contents are moved back. On failure, contents are moved to a recovery directory.
    *   `encryptTargetDir`: This internal helper function performs the steps of relocating contents, recreating the target, encrypting it, and handling intermediate failures by moving data to a recovery location if necessary.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This is a significant update to the `fscrypt` package.
        *   **Refined Error Handling**: New, more specific error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced.
        *   **Simplified `EncryptionResult`**: The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated `newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, and `BuildError` methods, indicating a change in how recovery failures are tracked or reported.
        *   **`EncryptTargetDirs` Reworked**:
            *   The import for `common` was removed, and the `tempDir` path was hardcoded directly as `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/` instead of using `common.MigrationDirPath`.
            *   The `encryptTargetDir` function was modified to return an `error`, instead of directly modifying the `result` struct.
            *   `EncryptTargetDirs` now uses a `switch` statement to handle the specific errors returned by `encryptTargetDir`, logging distinct messages for each failure type (relocate, encrypt, unlock, restore).
            *   On successful encryption, the `tempDir` (migration store) is explicitly cleaned up (`fs.RemoveAll(tempDir)`).
        *   **`encryptTargetDir` Changes**: The logic for moving contents to a dedicated `recoveryDir` and the `migrateToRecoveryDir` function calls were removed, streamlining the error path; errors are now simply returned.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Security Focus**: The application is deeply concerned with data integrity and encryption, utilizing `fscrypt` and TPM for key management, and `vault.SecureContainer` for in-memory key protection.
*   **Idempotency**: Several core functions (`enableIntegrity`, `EncryptTargetDirs`) are designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects.
*   **Directory Management**: A consistent set of special directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are used throughout the application for specific purposes, reflecting a structured approach to data persistence and recovery.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: The code heavily uses Go's error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`) and error introspection (`errors.Is`, `errors.As`) for detailed error reporting and decision-making. Custom error types are also defined.
*   **Logging**: Extensive use of a custom `log` package (from `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) at various debug levels to trace execution and report issues.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `afero` library is used for filesystem operations, providing an abstraction layer potentially for easier testing or cross-platform compatibility.
*   **Temporal Concentration**: Most changes occurred on 11/21/2025, with a significant refinement to the `fscrypt` package occurring a few days later on 11/25/2025.

The package comment described its role in holding secure keys and common variables.
*   **Updated (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** A minor change was made to the package comment, simplifying it to "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The directory path constants remained identical.

**/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go**
*   **Multiple Timestamps (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM):** This file consistently defines the core application logic for the Integrity Handler. It includes functions to:
    *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Check system prerequisites like running as root, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
    *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrate the encryption process by ensuring necessary directories exist, creating/decrypting the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories.
    *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlock previously encrypted directories.
    *   `getFsKey`: Securely manage the filesystem key using a `vault.SecureContainer`.
    *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Create and clean various critical directories with specific permissions.
    *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Log warnings if data is found in recovery directories, indicating potential issues requiring manual intervention.
    No functional changes were observed in this file across the provided timestamps.

**/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go**
*   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This file introduces the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines `ExitCode` constants to standardize process return values (e.g., success, generic failure, incompatible environment, integrity compromised). The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path command-line flag, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the application's flow, including version logging, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity, and unlocking directories. It specifically handles different error types, distinguishing between general failures and integrity compromises for exit codes.

**/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go**
*   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file implements high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error variables related to various stages of encryption (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`). It includes `SetupOnMount` for global `fscrypt` configuration and the `EncryptionResult` struct to track the success or failure of encrypting multiple directories. The core `EncryptTargetDirs` function manages the relocation of directory contents, recreation of encrypted directories, and restoration of contents, with mechanisms for recovery in case of failures. At this stage, it directly imported and utilized constants from the `common` package for migration and recovery directory paths.
*   **Updated (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):** This update introduced significant refinements:
    *   **Error Handling:** New, more granular error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added, improving the specificity of error reporting.
    *   **Recovery Logic Refinement:** The `EncryptionResult` struct was modified to remove `FailedToRecover []string`, indicating a change in how recovery failures are tracked or reported. This change was reflected in the `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods.
    *   **Dependency Decoupling:** The import of the `common` package was removed. Consequently, `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` now use hardcoded string literals for temporary migration paths (e.g., `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/" + dirName`) instead of relying on `common.MigrationDirPath`, suggesting a refactoring to reduce direct dependencies.
    *   **Enhanced Encryption Flow:** The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated with a `switch` statement for more explicit handling of different error types after `encryptTargetDir` attempts. On successful encryption and content restoration, it now explicitly attempts to remove the temporary migration directory. The `encryptTargetDir` function signature was also updated to accept the `tempDir` as a parameter.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The main development activity appears concentrated on 11/21/2025, with `common/directories.go` initialized, `integrity.go` core logic established, `main.go` introduced, and `fscrypt.go` first implemented. A notable refinement of the `fscrypt.go` logic, particularly around error handling and dependency management, occurred on 11/25/2025.

## 4:26:51 PM
The log details the development and refactoring of an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, which focuses on securing filesystem integrity through encryption.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defined essential directory paths as constants, including `/boot/integrity` for boot files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted Filesystem Encryption Master Key (FEMK), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration, recovery, and manifest data.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update to the package comment clarified its role as containing "common globals" rather than focusing on secure container specifics. The actual directory path constants remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This initial version of the file established core Integrity Handler logic. It includes functions to `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking prerequisites like root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command presence, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (setting up `fscrypt` and encrypting target directories), and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. The `getFsKey` function handles the secure decryption and storage of the FEMK in a `vault.SecureContainer`, ensuring the plaintext key is wiped from memory. Utility functions such as `ensureDirectoriesExist` (creating necessary directories with specific permissions) and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` were also defined.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**, **2:28:49 PM**, **2:40:35 PM**: No functional code changes were introduced at these timestamps; the file content remained identical to the earlier entry, likely indicating save operations without modifications.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file set up the application's entry point and `run` function. It defined custom `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) to align with standard systemd service return values. The `run` function orchestrates the application's flow, including version logging, environment verification, handling recovery warnings, enabling integrity, and unlocking directories. Robust error handling is implemented to return specific exit codes based on the nature of any encountered failure (e.g., `ExitIncompatible` for environment issues, `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations).

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: The initial implementation for `fscrypt` integration was provided here.

An `EncryptionResult` struct was introduced to track the status of encryption attempts, including different categories of success and failure. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function outlined the process of moving directory contents to a temporary location, creating an empty encrypted target directory, and eventually restoring the contents. The `encryptTargetDir` function contained specific logic for this relocation, directory recreation, encryption, and initial error-based recovery.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This timestamp marks a significant refactoring and enhancement. The `common` package import was removed, leading to the `migrationDirPath` being hardcoded within `fscrypt.go`. New specific error constants like `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore` were explicitly defined, while `ErrFailedToRecover` was removed. Consequently, the `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated to remove references to `FailedToRecover`. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was improved with a `switch` statement for more explicit error handling from `encryptTargetDir` and to ensure cleanup of temporary migration directories upon success. The `encryptTargetDir` function itself saw the removal of direct recovery logic (specifically the `migrateToRecoveryDir` call) and a modification to not return immediately on encryption failure.

    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially defined to hold constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` for core files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted filesystem encryption master key (FEMK), and dedicated paths under `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration data, recovery data, and integrity manifests.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor, non-functional update occurred to clarify the package-level comment, rephrasing it from a slightly malformed sentence to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This timestamp marks the introduction of the core logic for the Integrity Handler. It includes `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` to ensure the system meets requirements (root access, kernel >= 5.4, fscrypt support, TPM initialization). Functions like `enableIntegrity` orchestrate the encryption process, handling directory creation, FEMK resolution, and fscrypt setup. `unlockEncryptedDirs` manages decryption. `getFsKey` securely retrieves and manages the filesystem key using a `vault.SecureContainer`, including wiping the plain key from memory. `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates necessary paths with specific permissions, and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` checks for potential data loss scenarios.
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM, 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM, 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: No discernible functional changes were recorded for this file at these subsequent timestamps, suggesting minor edits or saves without code modifications.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**:

It configures logging, parses a `mount` command-line flag, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the overall flow: logging the application version, initializing application state, checking for recovery directory warnings, verifying the environment, and then calling `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes an `ExitCode` enum to provide specific return codes based on success, failure, incompatibility, or integrity compromise.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This initial version provided high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined several error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), implemented `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific fscrypt configuration, and introduced the `EncryptionResult` struct to track the success or failure of directory encryption stages. The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions managed the process of moving directory contents, encrypting the empty target, and then moving contents back. It used `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath` for temporary storage.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This update significantly refines the fscrypt wrapper logic, particularly in error handling and temporary directory management. New specific error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added, and the `EncryptionResult` struct was modified to track these new errors while removing a `FailedToRecover` field, indicating a revised recovery strategy. Notably, the `EncryptTargetDirs` function removed its `common` package import and began using a hardcoded path for the migration store (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`). It also introduced more detailed error handling with a `switch` statement after calling `encryptTargetDir` and added cleanup logic to remove temporary directories upon successful encryption. The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was adjusted to accept the temporary directory path directly, signifying a more explicit control over these paths.
