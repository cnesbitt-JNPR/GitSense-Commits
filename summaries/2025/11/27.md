# Activity Summary for 11/27/2025

## 12:26:56 AM
The log details development on Juniper Networks' Integrity Handler, a Go application focused on securing a system through filesystem encryption and integrity verification. The changes span three main files: `common/directories.go`, `integrity.go`, and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, along with the introduction of `main.go`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defines constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `BootDirPath` ("/boot/integrity"), `EncryptedKeyPath` ("/boot/integrity/femk.enc" for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key), `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`. The package comment indicates its role in holding secure keys and common variables.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update was made to the package comment, simplifying its description to "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined directory paths remained unchanged.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM**: This file contains the core logic of the Integrity Handler. Across these four entries, the code content remained identical, suggesting minor save operations without functional changes. Key functionalities include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Ensures the system meets requirements, checking for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`), and TPM/vTPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: An idempotent function responsible for ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving the FEMK, setting up `fscrypt` on the mount point, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking of encrypted directories, deeming failures as an "integrity compromised" state.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function to retrieve the filesystem key securely from a `vault.SecureContainer` after decrypting the FEMK, with explicit memory wiping of the plaintext key.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and manages the permissions for operational directories like migration, recovery, and manifest paths, utilizing constants from the `common` package.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks and logs warnings if the recovery directory contains data, indicating potential issues requiring manual intervention.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This log entry introduces the main application entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised). The `main` function parses command-line arguments (specifically a `mount` path), sets up logging, and orchestrates the application's flow by calling `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It maps errors from these functions to appropriate `ExitCode` values, prominently `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations. It also embeds the application version using `//go:embed`.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file introduces a package for high-level operations leveraging the `fscrypt` library. It defines various specific error types related to encryption (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`). An `EncryptionResult` struct is defined to track the detailed success/failure status of directory encryption, including `FailedToRecover`. The `SetupOnMount` function handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function orchestrates the encryption of multiple directories by relocating their contents, encrypting the empty directory, and then restoring the contents. It explicitly imported the `common` package to reference directory paths.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This is the most significant update in the log.
        *   **Removal of `common` import**: The `fscrypt` package no longer directly imports the `common` package. This leads to `MigrationDirPath` being replaced by a hardcoded path (`"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`) within `EncryptTargetDirs` for temporary directory management.
        *   **Enhanced Error Granularity**: New, explicit error variables `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore` were added, providing more specific failure indications.
        *   **Refactored `EncryptionResult`**: The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and related methods (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`), indicating a streamlined approach to recovery status tracking.
        *   **Improved Error Handling in `EncryptTargetDirs`**: The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to use a `switch` statement to handle the new explicit error types returned by `encryptTargetDir` and now includes cleanup for the temporary migration directory upon successful operations.
        *   **`encryptTargetDir` Signature Change**: The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was modified to accept `tempDir` as an argument, further decoupling it from the `common` package's directory constants. Recovery directory logic in this function appears to be simplified or removed from the provided snippet.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of shared directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial implementation of core Integrity Handler logic.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of the main application entry point and overall operational flow.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of the `fscrypt` wrapper package.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, indicating a design decision to remove direct `common` package dependency for path constants within the `fscrypt` logic, and to introduce more granular error handling.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright and Authorship**: All files consistently include a "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." header.
*   **Robust Logging**: Extensive use of a custom `log` package (e.g., `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Error`, `log.Warnf`) for detailed operational tracing, error reporting, and warnings.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Go's standard error handling patterns, including `fmt.Errorf` for wrapping errors with context, and `errors.Is`/`errors.As`/`errors.Join` for sophisticated error comparison and composition, are widely used. Specific custom error types are defined to categorize different failure scenarios.
*   **Secure Operations**: A strong emphasis on security and integrity, highlighted by the use of TPM initialization, a `vault.SecureContainer` for key management, and the `fscrypt` library for filesystem encryption. The concept of "integrity compromised" is a critical state explicitly handled.
*   **Idempotency**: Several functions, like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly designed to be idempotent to ensure consistent behavior on repeated execution.
*   **Standardized Directory Paths**: The application relies on a set of standardized directory paths (e.g., for boot, migration, recovery, manifests), initially defined in `common/directories.go`, though the `fscrypt` package later hardcoded one of these paths directly.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `afero.Fs` interface is used for filesystem operations, which typically facilitates testing and potentially supports different filesystem implementations.
*   **Future Work (`TODO` comments)**: Several `// TODO` comments indicate planned enhancements, such as better shredding for temporary data, more comprehensive path handling for upgrades, and manifest processing.

## 1:26:51 AM
The Integrity Handler application, written in Go, focuses on securing filesystems through encryption using the `fscrypt` library, with support for TPM/vTPM for key management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of constants for critical directory paths: `/boot/integrity` (boot directory), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (encrypted FEMK path), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (migration store), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (recovery directory), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (manifest files).
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor textual update to the package-level comment, changing it from a detailed description of the secure container to a more general "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM**: This file, implementing the core Integrity Handler logic, was logged multiple times with identical content. It includes functions for verifying environment requirements (root, kernel >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command, TPM initialization), enabling and unlocking integrity, managing the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK) using a secure vault, and ensuring necessary directories (defined in `common`) exist and are cleaned/checked. `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` specifically checks the recovery directory for unaddressed issues. No code changes were observed across these four timestamps for this file.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This new file was introduced as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for process termination status. The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path command-line argument, and orchestrates the integrity process by calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It maps any errors from these functions to the appropriate `ExitCode`. The file also uses `//go:embed` to include a version string.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**:
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined various error conditions specific to encryption, set a `protectorName` ("FEMK"), and provided `SetupOnMount` and `EncryptTargetDirs` functions. The `EncryptionResult` struct was introduced to track success and various failure modes (relocation, encryption, unlocking, restoration, recovery). The `encryptTargetDir` function detailed the steps: moving contents to a temporary location (using `common.MigrationDirPath`), recreating the target directory as empty, encrypting it, and then restoring contents.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This update represents a significant refactoring:
        *   The dependency on the `common` package was removed from this file.
        *   New, more specific error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was updated to remove `FailedToRecover`, and its `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were adjusted accordingly.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was modified: it now hardcodes the temporary migration path (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`) instead of using the `common.MigrationDirPath` constant. It also introduced a `switch` statement to handle different error types returned by `encryptTargetDir` more explicitly, and now explicitly removes the temporary migration directory upon successful encryption.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function was refactored to accept the `tempDir` as an argument and no longer directly manages a `recoveryDir`, simplifying its internal error handling regarding content migration.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of `main.go`, marking the application's top-level execution flow and error code definitions.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of `fscrypt.go`, establishing the core encryption and file migration logic.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A major refactor in `fscrypt.go`, removing a dependency on the `common` package, introducing more granular error types, and streamlining the error handling and temporary file management within the encryption process.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notices**: All files start with the Juniper Networks copyright for 2025.
*   **Consistent Logging**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is widely used across all files for structured debugging, informational, warning, and error messages.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: The codebase demonstrates a strong emphasis on detailed error handling, using `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.Join` to propagate and categorize errors. Specific exit codes are defined in `main.go` for various failure scenarios.
*   **Fscrypt Integration**: The core purpose revolves around integrating with `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, with explicit checks for kernel and filesystem support.
*   **Idempotency Requirement**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly documented as needing to be idempotent, ensuring they can be run multiple times without unintended side effects.
*   **Dedicated Directory Structure**: The application consistently relies on a set of well-defined directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, etc.) for its operations, emphasizing organized storage of keys, manifests, and temporary data.
