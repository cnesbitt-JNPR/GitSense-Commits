# Activity Summary for 11/28/2025

## 12:26:47 AM
The provided log details the evolution of a Go application named "Integrity Handler," primarily focused on ensuring filesystem integrity through encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially created, defining a set of essential directory paths as constants. These paths include `/boot/integrity` for handler files and the encrypted FEMK (`femk.enc`), as well as `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` for migration, recovery, and manifest data respectively.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update changed the package comment from "Package container common a secure container to hold our key at runtime..." to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The directory constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** (and subsequent entries at 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM): This file, the core of the Integrity Handler, was established. It includes functions for:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements such as root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt`'s `CheckSupport`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving the FEMK (File Encryption Master Key), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories. It is designed to be idempotent.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function to retrieve and securely store the filesystem key. It decrypts the FEMK and stores the plain key in a `vault.SecureContainer`, then safely wipes the original plain key.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and manages permissions for the application's various directories (migration, recovery, manifest, boot), including a cleanup step for the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for any contents in the recovery directory and logs warnings if manual intervention is needed.
    *   The entries between 2:27:15 PM and 2:40:35 PM show no functional changes in the code, suggesting minor saves or formatting changes not affecting logic.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file was introduced as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants for various application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible Environment, Integrity Compromised). The `main` function parses a `-mount` path argument, initializes logging, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates calls to `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, mapping returned errors to appropriate `ExitCode` values. It uses an embedded version string for tracking.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file was added to provide high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error types related to encryption failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`). Key components include:
        *   `protectorName` constant ("FEMK").
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Configures `fscrypt` globally and for the specific mount path.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: A detailed structure to track the success or failure of each step during directory encryption for multiple targets (e.g., `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, `FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRestore`, `FailedToRecover`). It also provides `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: An idempotent function that iterates through target directories, checks if they are already encrypted, and initiates the `encryptTargetDir` process.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: This function's logic involves relocating target directory contents to a temporary location, recreating the target directory as an empty (encrypted) directory, and then attempting to move the original contents back. It logs detailed errors and attempts to move contents to a recovery directory on specific failures.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This entry shows significant refactoring in the `fscrypt.go` file:
        *   New specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced to provide more granular error reporting.
        *   The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct, and related error building logic was also removed, indicating a change in how recovery failures are tracked or handled at this level.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function no longer imports the `common` package, and the `tempDir` path is now hardcoded instead of using `common.MigrationDirPath`.
        *   Error handling within `EncryptTargetDirs` was enhanced with a `switch` statement to categorize and log different types of encryption failures (`ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`). Upon successful encryption, the temporary migration directory is explicitly removed.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was changed to accept `tempDir` as a parameter and it no longer manages `recoveryDir` directly or contains the logic for moving contents to a recovery directory, suggesting this responsibility was shifted elsewhere. The logic for capturing original directory permissions was also simplified.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notices**: All files consistently include the copyright notice "// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved."
*   **Structured Error Handling**: The codebase heavily relies on Go's `errors` package, utilizing `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` for error wrapping, `errors.Is`, and `errors.As` for precise error classification and propagation. Custom error types are frequently defined.
*   **Logging**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is used consistently across all modules for debugging, informational, warning, and error messages.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used for filesystem operations, which aids in testability and abstracting the underlying OS filesystem.
*   **Security Focus**: The application demonstrates a strong emphasis on security by checking for root privileges, kernel versions, utilizing `fscrypt` for encryption, integrating with TPM (Trusted Platform Module) for key management, and securely handling the FEMK with `vault.SecureContainer` and memory wiping.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed and documented to be idempotent, ensuring consistent behavior even if called multiple times.
*   **Directory Management**: Common directory paths defined in `common/directories.go` are used throughout `integrity.go` and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` to manage application files, migration data, recovery data, and manifests.
*   **FEMK Centrality**: The File Encryption Master Key (FEMK) is a central component, with its encrypted path `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` and secure handling being a recurring theme.

## 1:26:51 AM
The logs detail changes across several Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focused on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM integration for key management.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially defined, establishing constant directory paths essential for the Integrity Handler's operations. These include `/boot/integrity` for core files and the encrypted key (`femk.enc`), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration data, recovery, and manifest files.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update occurred where the package comment was changed for clarity, from "Package container common a secure container..." to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constant paths remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 2:27:22 PM; 2:28:49 PM; 2:40:35 PM**: This file contains the core logic of the Integrity Handler. Throughout these timestamps, the content remained identical, suggesting minor saves or metadata updates rather than functional code changes. The code defines functions for:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements such as root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process by ensuring necessary directories exist, creating/resolving the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories, flagging failures as integrity compromises.
        *   `getFsKey`: Retrieves the filesystem key, decrypting the FEMK and storing it securely in a `vault.SecureContainer` before wiping the plain key from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and sets permissions for critical directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) and cleans the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if data is found in the recovery directory after a potential migration failure.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file serves as the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines custom `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for structured program termination. The `main` function parses a `mountPath` flag and calls the `run` function, which orchestrates the calls to `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It handles different error types to return appropriate exit codes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This version of the file implemented high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined various error types related to encryption failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`). It includes functions like `SetupOnMount` for `fscrypt` setup, and `EncryptTargetDirs` which iterates through targets, calling `encryptTargetDir` to handle the relocation of contents, recreation of directories, and actual encryption. The `EncryptionResult` struct was introduced to track the detailed outcome of encryption attempts. The `encryptTargetDir` function directly modified the `EncryptionResult` struct and called `migrateToRecoveryDir` on certain failures.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This is a significant update to the file.
        *   The import for the `common` package was removed.
        *   New specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced, and the `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its related methods (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`).
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was refactored to handle error outcomes from `encryptTargetDir` using a `switch` statement and now attempts to remove temporary migration directories on success.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was changed to accept `tempDir` as a parameter and now returns an `error` instead of modifying the `EncryptionResult` directly. A hardcoded path `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/` was introduced for `tempDir` within `EncryptTargetDirs` due to the removal of the `common` import.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial creation and definition of critical directory paths in `common/directories.go`.

        *   **Improved Error Granularity:** New, more specific error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced, providing clearer indications of failure points.
        *   **`EncryptionResult` Structure Update:** The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct, and its usage was consequently removed from the `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods, indicating a change in how recovery failures are tracked or handled within this package.
        *   **Refactored `EncryptTargetDirs`:** The logic within `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to utilize a `switch` statement for specific error handling after `encryptTargetDir` returns. Importantly, if encryption is successful, it now explicitly removes the temporary directory used for migration.
        *   **`encryptTargetDir` Parameterization:** The `tempDir` parameter was introduced for `encryptTargetDir`, removing its internal reliance on constants from the now-removed `common` package for constructing temporary paths. The explicit handling of `recoveryDir` and its associated content migration logic (previously implied within comments or partial code) was also affected, appearing to be removed from this code snippet.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notices:** All code files consistently begin with the `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` header, indicating a common origin and intellectual property.

*   **Idempotency:** Key functions related to system modification, such as `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly noted to be idempotent, ensuring consistent behavior on repeated calls.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used for abstracting filesystem operations, suggesting a design that allows for easier testing and potentially different underlying filesystem implementations.
*   **Directory Management:** There's a repeated pattern of creating necessary directories with specific permissions (`fs.MkdirAll`) and managing temporary directories for data migration and recovery, with efforts to clean them up.

## 3:26:46 AM
The provided log details changes across several Go source files related to an "Integrity Handler" application. The core purpose of this application appears to be managing filesystem encryption, likely for security and integrity of critical directories, leveraging `fscrypt` and TPM/vTPM.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM (initial state) and 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM (update).
    *   **Key Updates:** This file defines global constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key - FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files). The only change observed is a minor clarification in the package comment at 4:02:40 PM, updating it from a detailed description of secure container reliance to a simpler "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** This is a central file implementing the Integrity Handler's logic. It includes functions for:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: The main function to set up and enable integrity, which ensures necessary directories exist, resolves the FEMK, sets up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypts target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Lazy-loads the filesystem key into a secure container, wiping the plain key afterwards.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates all required application directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) with appropriate permissions, and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for existing contents in the recovery directory and logs warnings if found, indicating potential data loss or required manual intervention.
    *   **Pattern:** Notably, despite multiple timestamps spanning over an hour, the code content for this file appears functionally identical across all provided log entries.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM.
    *   **Key Updates:** This is the application's entry point.
        *   It defines `ExitCode` constants for different process return values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised), aligning with `systemd` service return codes.
        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path command-line argument, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It handles errors from these functions, mapping them to the defined `ExitCode` values.
        *   It uses `_ "embed"` to embed a version string.
        *   A `DefaultManifest()` function is called, indicating a placeholder for processing manifest files that define encryption targets.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM (initial state) and 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM (significant update).
    *   **Key Updates:** This file provides high-level Go wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines various specific error types related to encryption failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`).
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Configures `fscrypt` globally and on a specific mount path.
        *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct to report the status of encryption attempts for multiple target directories, categorizing successes and different failure types.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through target directories, encrypting them if not already encrypted, and migrating contents.
        *   **Significant Refactoring (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
            *   Several new error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added, and `ErrFailedToRecover` was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its error handling.
            *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated to reflect these changes in tracked failure types.
            *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function underwent substantial refactoring in its error handling logic. It now uses a `switch` statement to categorize and log different types of errors returned by `encryptTargetDir`. Upon successful encryption of a target directory, it explicitly removes the temporary migration directory.
            *   The `encryptTargetDir` function was modified to take `tempDir` as a parameter instead of constructing it internally using `common.MigrationDirPath`, implying a change in how temporary paths are managed or passed. The import of the `common` package was removed from this file, further supporting this. Recovery directory logic within this function was also simplified or removed.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright Notice:** All files consistently include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`.
*   **Logging:** Extensive use of `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warnf`, `log.Errorf` is present across all files for detailed operational feedback and error reporting.
*   **Error Handling:** A robust error handling pattern is evident, utilizing Go's `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, `errors.Join`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.As` for creating, wrapping, and inspecting errors. The `fscrypt.go` file specifically defines a comprehensive set of custom error types.
*   **Dependencies:** The project heavily relies on `github.com/spf13/afero` for abstract filesystem operations and `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption functionalities. `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` is the common logging library.
*   **Timestamps without Code Changes:** The `integrity.go` file shows multiple consecutive timestamps with identical code content, which could indicate frequent saves, build processes, or automated file updates that don't alter the functional code.
*   **Security Focus:** The codebase is clearly focused on security, specifically filesystem integrity and encryption, as indicated by references to FEMK, fscrypt, TPM, and secure containers. Directories related to "migration-recovery" and "integrity-compromised" errors highlight robustness and failure handling in a security context.

    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defines constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and the encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files). The package comment indicates it also holds elements for a secure key container.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated for clarity, stating it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The directory path constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This file contains the core logic of the Integrity Handler application. Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, which checks system requirements (root user, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support via `fscrypt`, TPM initialization); `enableIntegrity`, responsible for ensuring necessary directories exist, creating/resolving the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories; and `unlockEncryptedDirs` for decrypting and unlocking previously encrypted directories. It also defines `ensureDirectoriesExist` to set up directories with specific permissions and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to alert if recovery data exists.
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: No functional code changes were observed in these subsequent entries for `integrity.go`, suggesting these might be minor, non-functional edits or save operations.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants to indicate different application outcomes (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitCompromised`). The `main` function initializes logging, parses command-line arguments (specifically a `mountPath`), and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the application flow, invoking functions from `integrity.go` to verify the environment, enable integrity, and unlock directories, mapping any detected errors to appropriate `ExitCode` values, particularly `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines various error types related to encryption failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), a `protectorName` constant ("FEMK"), and the `SetupOnMount` function for `fscrypt` initialization. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the status of encryption attempts. `EncryptTargetDirs` iterates through specified directories, and `encryptTargetDir` performs the detailed steps for encrypting a single directory, including relocating its contents, recreating an empty target directory, encrypting it, and handling potential recovery.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This entry reflects significant refactoring of error handling and directory management within the `fscrypt` package.
        *   **Expanded Error Types**: New explicit error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced.
        *   **Simplified `EncryptionResult`**: The `EncryptionResult` struct was streamlined by removing the `FailedToRecover` field, and corresponding logic in `newEncryptionResult`, `Failed()`, and `BuildError()` was updated.
        *   **Refactored Encryption Flow**: The `EncryptTargetDirs` function no longer imports the `common` package (implying hardcoding or internal derivation of temporary paths), and its error handling for `encryptTargetDir` now uses a `switch` statement for specific error types. It also explicitly removes temporary migration directories upon successful encryption.
        *   **Altered `encryptTargetDir`**: The `recoveryDir` parameter was removed from `encryptTargetDir`, and the explicit `migrateToRecoveryDir` call and its associated logic for handling failures to create the empty target directory were removed. This indicates a shift in the failure recovery strategy, potentially centralizing it elsewhere or simplifying the immediate recovery step within this function.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Assertion**: All Go files begin with a consistent `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` notice.
*   **Integrity-Focused Application**: The entire codebase is dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily dealing with secure data storage via filesystem encryption, key management using a "FEMK" (File Encryption Master Key) and TPM, and maintaining system integrity.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Go's `errors` package, `fmt.Errorf` with wrapping (`%w`), and `errors.Is`/`errors.As` are frequently used for detailed error propagation and checking specific error conditions. The application defines an `errIntegrityCompromised` error and maps internal errors to distinct `ExitCode` values.
*   **System Directory Conventions**: Specific directory paths, often under `/boot` and `/opt/128technology/integrity/`, are consistently used for application files, encrypted keys, migration data, recovery data, and manifest files.
*   **Comprehensive Logging**: The use of `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warnf`, and `log.Errorf` throughout the code indicates a detailed logging strategy for operational transparency and debugging.
*   **Idempotent Operations**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be safely executed multiple times without adverse effects.
*   **External Library Dependencies**: The project heavily relies on external Go libraries for crucial functionalities, including `github.com/google/fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, `github.com/spf13/afero` for filesystem abstraction, and internal `vault` and `tpm` packages for secure key storage and Trusted Platform Module interactions.

    *   **No functional changes were observed in `integrity.go` across the four log entries on 11/21/2025, indicating repeated saves or minor, unlogged edits not reflected in the provided diffs.**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This log introduces the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application.
        *   It defines `ExitCode` constants for different process outcomes: `ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, and `ExitCompromised`.
        *   Uses `//go:embed` to include a version string.
        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path flag, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: logging the version, initializing application state, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity` (processing `DefaultManifest()` targets), and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It maps various error conditions to the defined `ExitCode` values.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial commit of the `fscrypt` wrapper package.
        *   Defines numerous error constants related to `fscrypt` operations (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`).
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup, checking for idempotency.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: Introduced to track the success and various failure modes of directory encryption (e.g., `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, `FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRestore`, `FailedToRecover`). Includes `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through target directories, encrypting them if not already encrypted by calling `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Contains the logic for vacating a target directory, recreating it empty with original permissions, encrypting it, and handling error scenarios by logging and potentially moving contents to a recovery directory. It used `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath` constants.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A significant update to the `fscrypt` package.
        *   **Removal of `common` import**: The `common` package import was removed, indicating a refactoring of how directory paths are handled, moving away from shared constants in this specific file.
        *   **New Error Constants**: Explicit error constants `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were added.
        *   **Refinement of `EncryptionResult`**: The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct, and corresponding logic in `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods was updated.
        *   **Changes in `EncryptTargetDirs`**: The logic for constructing `tempDir` was moved directly into the loop, hardcoding the base path `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`. A `switch` statement was added to handle different error types returned by `encryptTargetDir`, and successful encryption now includes a call to `fs.RemoveAll(tempDir)`.
        *   **Refinement of `encryptTargetDir`**: The function signature was updated to accept `tempDir` as an argument, reflecting the change in how temporary directory paths are managed, and the `recoveryDir` construction logic was no longer present in the provided snippet for this function.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial commit of the main `integrity.go` application logic.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of the `main.go` entry point, defining execution flow and exit codes.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial commit of the `fscrypt` wrapper, detailing encryption and error handling mechanisms.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A substantial refactoring of the `fscrypt` package, including removal of a dependency on the `common` package, explicit error definitions, and changes to the encryption and recovery flow, indicating a focused effort to improve robustness or clarify error handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security Focus**: The overall theme revolves around "Integrity Handler" for secure filesystem encryption, utilizing TPM and secure key containers, with specific directory paths for encrypted keys (`femk.enc`) and migration/recovery data.
*   **Error Handling and Robustness**: The code demonstrates a strong emphasis on detailed error handling, with custom error types, `errors.Is`/`errors.As` usage, and comprehensive logging, especially in `fscrypt.go` and `main.go`. The `EncryptionResult` struct is a prime example of tracking granular success and failure states.
*   **Idempotency**: The `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` functions are explicitly noted as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for reliable, repeatable operations.
*   **Directory Management**: There's a consistent pattern of creating, managing, and cleaning specific directories for migration, recovery, and manifest storage, ensuring proper permissions.
*   **Dependency Management**: The `fscrypt` package from Google is a key external dependency for encryption, along with `spf13/afero` for abstracting filesystem operations.
*   **Refactoring over time**: The change in `fscrypt.go` on 11/25/2025, particularly the removal of the `common` import and re-hardcoding paths, points to an ongoing development process where architectural decisions are being refined, potentially for better encapsulation or simplification within the `fscrypt` package itself.
