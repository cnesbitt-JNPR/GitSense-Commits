# Activity Summary for 11/29/2025

## 12:26:43 AM
The log details recent changes across several Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on secure filesystem encryption and key management using `fscrypt` and TPM. All changes occurred in November 2025, specifically between the 21st and 25th.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant directory paths crucial for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and the encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for failure recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files). The package comment initially referenced a "secure container to hold our key at runtime."
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated to a more general "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," but the defined constants remained unchanged.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler. Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support via `fscrypt`, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (which sets up required directories, creates/retrieves the FEMK, sets up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypts target directories), and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It also includes functions for securely handling the filesystem key (`getFsKey`) and ensuring necessary directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`). An `errIntegrityCompromised` error is defined.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**: No functional changes were observed; the code is identical to the previous entry.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM**: A minor refactoring occurred in the `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function. The explicit check `afero.Exists(afero.NewOsFs(), common.RecoveryDirPath)` and the subsequent `if !exists { return }` were removed. This suggests that `afero.ReadDir` is now solely relied upon to determine directory existence and handle errors.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: No functional changes were observed; the code is identical to the previous entry.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines custom `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for different application outcomes. The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path argument, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the main workflow: retrieving the handler version, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity for default targets, and then unlocking any already-encrypted directories. It handles different error conditions by returning appropriate `ExitCode` values.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file introduces high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error variables (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`) and a `protectorName` constant "FEMK". Key functions include `SetupOnMount` for configuring `fscrypt` globally and per mount point, and `EncryptTargetDirs` which attempts to encrypt target directories, move contents out, encrypt the empty directory, and then move contents back in. It uses an `EncryptionResult` struct to track success and various failure types. It imported `common` for directory paths.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Significant refactoring was performed:
        *   New specific error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added and existing error comments were enhanced.
        *   The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated functions (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`).
        *   The `common` package import was removed. Consequently, the `tempDir` path in `EncryptTargetDirs` was hardcoded to `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/" + dirName`, replacing the `common.MigrationDirPath` usage.
        *   The `recoveryDir` parameter and related logic were removed from the `encryptTargetDir` function signature and its call within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   Error handling within `EncryptTargetDirs` was enhanced with a `switch` statement to categorize and log different `encryptTargetDir` failures (`ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, etc.) and a `default` case to clean up `tempDir` on success.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice**: All files include the copyright `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Integrity Focus**: The overarching theme is the "Integrity Handler" application, designed for "Config Integrity" using filesystem encryption.
*   **Key Management**: Frequent references to "FEMK" (File Encryption Master Key) and the use of a "SecureContainer" (from the `vault` package) highlight a focus on secure key handling and storage.
*   **Filesystem Operations**: The `fscrypt` package is central to encryption, and the `afero` library is consistently used for abstracting filesystem operations.
*   **Directory Structure**: A consistent set of special directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are managed for the integrity process.
*   **Error Handling**: Go's error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)` and `errors.Is`) is used extensively for detailed error reporting.
*   **Timestamps**: While all changes are in November 2025, the multiple identical timestamps for `integrity.go` suggest either re-saving without changes or minor, unlogged metadata updates. The `fscrypt.go` update on 11/25 shows a more substantial functional refactoring.

## 1:26:48 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on filesystem encryption, key management, and directory operations.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** This file initially defines several constant directory paths critical for the Integrity Handler, including `BootDirPath`, `EncryptedKeyPath` (for `femk.enc`), `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`. It also includes a comment indicating the package's role in providing a secure container for runtime keys using mmap'ed and mlocked memory.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** The primary change here is a refinement of the package-level comment, simplifying its description to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined directory paths remain unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM:** The content of this file remained consistent across these four timestamps. It defines the core logic for the Integrity Handler application.
        *   It imports `context`, `errors`, `fmt`, `os`, `os/exec`, `path/filepath`, `fscrypt/metadata`, `fscrypt/util`, `afero`, `common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`, and `log`.
        *   It declares `errIntegrityCompromised`.
        *   Key functions include:
            *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements such as root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt/metadata.CheckSupport`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
            *   `enableIntegrity`: An idempotent function that ensures necessary directories exist, creates/retrieves the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), sets up `fscrypt` on the mount point, and initiates encryption of target directories.
            *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks previously encrypted directories using the filesystem key.
            *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function to retrieve the filesystem key, decrypting the FEMK and storing it in a `vault.SecureContainer`, then securely wiping the plaintext key.
            *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and cleans up application-specific directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) with appropriate permissions.
            *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if contents are found in the recovery directory, suggesting manual intervention.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** This file contains the main entry point and execution flow for the Integrity Handler.
        *   It defines custom `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with `systemd` service return codes.
        *   It embeds the application version using `//go:embed integrity-handler.version`.
        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` command-line flag, and orchestrates the application's lifecycle via the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function logs the application version, initializes an `appState`, calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings()`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment()`, `enableIntegrity()`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs()`. It handles errors by mapping them to the specific `ExitCode` values for incompatibility, integrity compromise, or general failure.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines numerous error constants, such as `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrDestinationNotEmpty`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, and `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`, indicating various failure conditions during encryption and relocation.
        *   The `protectorName` constant is set to "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount` handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup, ensuring idempotency.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct is introduced to track the success and various failure modes (e.g., `FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRestore`, `FailedToRecover`). It includes methods `Failed()` and `BuildError()` for status reporting.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` is the main encryption orchestrator, which checks if a directory is already encrypted and then calls `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` outlines the process of moving existing contents out of a target directory (to `common.MigrationDirPath`), recreating and encrypting the empty target, and includes TODOs for permission replication and recovery.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** This entry shows a significant refactoring and enhancement of error handling and directory management within the `fscrypt` package.
        *   The import for `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` is *removed*.
        *   New granular error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) are explicitly defined.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct is updated to *remove* the `FailedToRecover` field, indicating a change in how recovery failures are tracked or handled.
        *   In `EncryptTargetDirs`, the `tempDir` path is now hardcoded to `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/" + dirName`, replacing the usage of `common.MigrationDirPath` (which explains the import removal).
        *   Error handling after calling `encryptTargetDir` is enhanced with a `switch` statement for specific error types, and successful operations now explicitly remove the temporary migration directory.
        *   In `encryptTargetDir`, the logic for using and handling a separate `recoveryDir` and `migrateToRecoveryDir` function is removed, suggesting a revised recovery strategy or scope.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial definition of common directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** Introduction of the core `integrity.go` logic, establishing environment verification, encryption, and unlocking mechanisms. Subsequent timestamps for `integrity.go` (2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM) show no functional changes in the provided content.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** Introduction of `main.go`, defining the application's entry point, exit codes, and overall execution flow.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** A minor documentation update in `common/directories.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** Initial detailed implementation of `fscrypt` integration, including error types, setup, and the `EncryptionResult` mechanism.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** Major refactoring in `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, involving removal of the `common` dependency, introduction of more specific error types, changes to `EncryptionResult` (removal of `FailedToRecover`), hardcoding of the migration path, and significant changes to the error handling and recovery logic within `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir`. This is the latest and most substantial functional change observed.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright Notice:** All Go files consistently include the copyright `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Logging:** The `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) is used extensively across `integrity.go`, `main.go`, and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` for debugging, informational, warning, and error messages.
*   **Error Handling:** Go's standard error handling patterns (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Is`, `errors.As`, `errors.Join`) are consistently used throughout the codebase, with a trend towards more specific and composite error reporting (especially in `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`).
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used for filesystem operations, providing an abstraction layer over `os` package functionality.
*   **Security Focus:** The application's core purpose is "Integrity Handler" and frequently mentions "encryption," "secure container," "TPM," and "integrity compromised" errors, indicating a strong focus on data security and system integrity.
*   **Directory Management:** Constants for specific operational directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are central to the application's design, initially defined in `common/directories.go` and used throughout the application, though `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` hardcoded its migration path in the latest change.
*   **Idempotency:** Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be called multiple times without causing unintended side effects.
*   **FEMK (File Encryption Master Key):** The FEMK is a recurring concept, indicating a central key used for encryption, often involving TPM for its security.

## 2:26:42 AM
The code changes primarily revolve around a Go application called "Integrity Handler" developed by Juniper Networks, Inc. The application aims to secure directories using filesystem encryption (`fscrypt`) and TPM for key management (FEMK).

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial change (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file defines several constant paths crucial for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` for core files and the encrypted FEMK, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration, recovery, and manifest data. The initial package comment was verbose, mentioning secure containers for keys.
    *   **Later change (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** The package comment was simplified to "// Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler.", clarifying its purpose. No other code changes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Multiple updates (11/21/2025, from 2:27:15 PM to 2:40:35 PM):** This file consistently defines the core logic for the Integrity Handler. Key functions include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like running as root, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring directories exist, resolving the FEMK, setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories, flagging failures as integrity compromises.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function for the filesystem key, ensuring it's stored in a `SecureContainer` and the plain key is wiped.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and optionally cleans the application's working directories with specific file permissions.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for data in the recovery directory, suggesting manual intervention if found.
    *   Despite multiple timestamps, the actual code content for `integrity.go` remained unchanged across all entries on 11/21/2025, suggesting frequent saves during development.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Single change (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This is the application's entry point.
        *   It defines custom `ExitCode` constants for success, generic failure, incompatibility, and integrity compromise, aligning with `systemd` service return codes.
        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a mount path argument, and calls `run`.
        *   The `run` function coordinates the application's flow: logging version, initializing application state, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, calling `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes `TODO` comments for processing manifests and plumbing the `path` argument.
        *   It uses Go's `embed` feature to include `integrity-handler.version`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial change (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines various error types related to encryption failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`).
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Handles global and filesystem-specific fscrypt setup.
        *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct to track the outcome of encryption attempts (success, already encrypted, various failure types). It includes methods to check for failures and build composite error messages.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through target directories, ensuring idempotency, and calls `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: This core function outlines the encryption process: relocating existing contents, recreating an empty target directory, encrypting it, and handling errors. It had `TODO` comments about proper unwind steps and recovery.
    *   **Significant update (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
        *   **Refinement of Error Handling:** New explicit error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced to provide more granular error tracking.
        *   **Streamlined `EncryptionResult`:** The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and related methods (`Failed`, `BuildError`), indicating a change in how recovery failures are handled or reported.
        *   **Improved `EncryptTargetDirs` Logic:** The `EncryptTargetDirs` function now uses a `switch` statement with `errors.Is` to explicitly handle different types of errors returned by `encryptTargetDir`, allowing for more specific logging and potentially different recovery paths. Upon successful encryption, it now explicitly removes the temporary migration directory.
        *   **Refactored `encryptTargetDir`:** The function's signature was changed to return an `error` directly, and the `tempDir` is now passed as an argument. The internal logic related to `recoveryDir` and `migrateToRecoveryDir` was removed, suggesting a shift in responsibility for recovery management. The import of the `common` package was also removed from this file.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025:** Initial setup and development of core components (`directories.go`, `integrity.go`, `main.go`, `fscrypt.go`). The `integrity.go` file saw multiple saves without functional changes over a short period (2:27 PM to 2:40 PM). The `main.go` and initial `fscrypt.go` were committed around 4:00 PM and 4:11 PM respectively.
*   **11/25/2025:** A distinct and significant update to `fscrypt.go`, four days after the initial changes, indicating a focused iteration on error handling, result reporting, and potentially a refactoring of recovery mechanisms within the encryption process.
