# Activity Summary for 11/29/2025

## 12:26:43 AM
The log details recent changes across several Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on secure filesystem encryption and key management using `fscrypt` and TPM. All changes occurred in November 2025, specifically between the 21st and 25th.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant directory paths crucial for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and the encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for failure recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files). The package comment initially referenced a "secure container to hold our key at runtime."
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated to a more general "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," but the defined constants remained unchanged.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler. Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support via `fscrypt`, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (which sets up required directories, creates/retrieves the FEMK, sets up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypts target directories), and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It also includes functions for securely handling the filesystem key (`getFsKey`) and ensuring necessary directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`). An `errIntegrityCompromised` error is defined.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**: No functional changes were observed; the code is identical to the previous entry.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM**: A minor refactoring occurred in the `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function. The explicit check `afero.Exists(afero.NewOsFs(), common.RecoveryDirPath)` and the subsequent `if !exists { return }` were removed. This suggests that `afero.ReadDir` is now solely relied upon to determine directory existence and handle errors.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: No functional changes were observed; the code is identical to the previous entry.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines custom `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for different application outcomes. The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path argument, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the main workflow: retrieving the handler version, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity for default targets, and then unlocking any already-encrypted directories. It handles different error conditions by returning appropriate `ExitCode` values.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file introduces high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error variables (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`) and a `protectorName` constant "FEMK". Key functions include `SetupOnMount` for configuring `fscrypt` globally and per mount point, and `EncryptTargetDirs` which attempts to encrypt target directories, move contents out, encrypt the empty directory, and then move contents back in. It uses an `EncryptionResult` struct to track success and various failure types. It imported `common` for directory paths.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Significant refactoring was performed:
        *   New specific error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added and existing error comments were enhanced.
        *   The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated functions (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`).
        *   The `common` package import was removed. Consequently, the `tempDir` path in `EncryptTargetDirs` was hardcoded to `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/" + dirName`, replacing the `common.MigrationDirPath` usage.
        *   The `recoveryDir` parameter and related logic were removed from the `encryptTargetDir` function signature and its call within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   Error handling within `EncryptTargetDirs` was enhanced with a `switch` statement to categorize and log different `encryptTargetDir` failures (`ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, etc.) and a `default` case to clean up `tempDir` on success.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice**: All files include the copyright `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Integrity Focus**: The overarching theme is the "Integrity Handler" application, designed for "Config Integrity" using filesystem encryption.
*   **Key Management**: Frequent references to "FEMK" (File Encryption Master Key) and the use of a "SecureContainer" (from the `vault` package) highlight a focus on secure key handling and storage.
*   **Filesystem Operations**: The `fscrypt` package is central to encryption, and the `afero` library is consistently used for abstracting filesystem operations.
*   **Directory Structure**: A consistent set of special directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are managed for the integrity process.
*   **Error Handling**: Go's error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)` and `errors.Is`) is used extensively for detailed error reporting.
*   **Timestamps**: While all changes are in November 2025, the multiple identical timestamps for `integrity.go` suggest either re-saving without changes or minor, unlogged metadata updates. The `fscrypt.go` update on 11/25 shows a more substantial functional refactoring.

## 1:26:48 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on filesystem encryption, key management, and directory operations.

            *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if contents are found in the recovery directory, suggesting manual intervention.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** This file contains the main entry point and execution flow for the Integrity Handler.
        *   It defines custom `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with `systemd` service return codes.
        *   It embeds the application version using `//go:embed integrity-handler.version`.
        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` command-line flag, and orchestrates the application's lifecycle via the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function logs the application version, initializes an `appState`, calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings()`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment()`, `enableIntegrity()`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs()`. It handles errors by mapping them to the specific `ExitCode` values for incompatibility, integrity compromise, or general failure.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines numerous error constants, such as `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrDestinationNotEmpty`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, and `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`, indicating various failure conditions during encryption and relocation.
        *   The `protectorName` constant is set to "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount` handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup, ensuring idempotency.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct is introduced to track the success and various failure modes (e.g., `FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRestore`, `FailedToRecover`). It includes methods `Failed()` and `BuildError()` for status reporting.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` is the main encryption orchestrator, which checks if a directory is already encrypted and then calls `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` outlines the process of moving existing contents out of a target directory (to `common.MigrationDirPath`), recreating and encrypting the empty target, and includes TODOs for permission replication and recovery.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** This entry shows a significant refactoring and enhancement of error handling and directory management within the `fscrypt` package.
        *   The import for `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` is *removed*.
        *   New granular error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) are explicitly defined.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct is updated to *remove* the `FailedToRecover` field, indicating a change in how recovery failures are tracked or handled.
        *   In `EncryptTargetDirs`, the `tempDir` path is now hardcoded to `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/" + dirName`, replacing the usage of `common.MigrationDirPath` (which explains the import removal).
        *   Error handling after calling `encryptTargetDir` is enhanced with a `switch` statement for specific error types, and successful operations now explicitly remove the temporary migration directory.
        *   In `encryptTargetDir`, the logic for using and handling a separate `recoveryDir` and `migrateToRecoveryDir` function is removed, suggesting a revised recovery strategy or scope.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

This is the latest and most substantial functional change observed.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright Notice:** All Go files consistently include the copyright `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Logging:** The `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) is used extensively across `integrity.go`, `main.go`, and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` for debugging, informational, warning, and error messages.
*   **Error Handling:** Go's standard error handling patterns (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Is`, `errors.As`, `errors.Join`) are consistently used throughout the codebase, with a trend towards more specific and composite error reporting (especially in `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`).
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used for filesystem operations, providing an abstraction layer over `os` package functionality.
*   **Security Focus:** The application's core purpose is "Integrity Handler" and frequently mentions "encryption," "secure container," "TPM," and "integrity compromised" errors, indicating a strong focus on data security and system integrity.
*   **Directory Management:** Constants for specific operational directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are central to the application's design, initially defined in `common/directories.go` and used throughout the application, though `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` hardcoded its migration path in the latest change.
*   **Idempotency:** Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be called multiple times without causing unintended side effects.
*   **FEMK (File Encryption Master Key):** The FEMK is a recurring concept, indicating a central key used for encryption, often involving TPM for its security.

## 2:26:42 AM
The code changes primarily revolve around a Go application called "Integrity Handler" developed by Juniper Networks, Inc. The application aims to secure directories using filesystem encryption (`fscrypt`) and TPM for key management (FEMK).

**File-specific Updates:**

    *   **Initial change (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file defines several constant paths crucial for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` for core files and the encrypted FEMK, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration, recovery, and manifest data. The initial package comment was verbose, mentioning secure containers for keys.
    *   **Later change (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** The package comment was simplified to "// Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler.", clarifying its purpose. No other code changes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Multiple updates (11/21/2025, from 2:27:15 PM to 2:40:35 PM):** This file consistently defines the core logic for the Integrity Handler. Key functions include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like running as root, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring directories exist, resolving the FEMK, setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories, flagging failures as integrity compromises.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function for the filesystem key, ensuring it's stored in a `SecureContainer` and the plain key is wiped.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and optionally cleans the application's working directories with specific file permissions.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for data in the recovery directory, suggesting manual intervention if found.
    *   Despite multiple timestamps, the actual code content for `integrity.go` remained unchanged across all entries on 11/21/2025, suggesting frequent saves during development.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Single change (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This is the application's entry point.
        *   It defines custom `ExitCode` constants for success, generic failure, incompatibility, and integrity compromise, aligning with `systemd` service return codes.
        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a mount path argument, and calls `run`.
        *   The `run` function coordinates the application's flow: logging version, initializing application state, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, calling `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes `TODO` comments for processing manifests and plumbing the `path` argument.
        *   It uses Go's `embed` feature to include `integrity-handler.version`.

        *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct to track the outcome of encryption attempts (success, already encrypted, various failure types). It includes methods to check for failures and build composite error messages.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through target directories, ensuring idempotency, and calls `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: This core function outlines the encryption process: relocating existing contents, recreating an empty target directory, encrypting it, and handling errors. It had `TODO` comments about proper unwind steps and recovery.
    *   **Significant update (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
        *   **Refinement of Error Handling:** New explicit error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced to provide more granular error tracking.
        *   **Streamlined `EncryptionResult`:** The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and related methods (`Failed`, `BuildError`), indicating a change in how recovery failures are handled or reported.
        *   **Improved `EncryptTargetDirs` Logic:** The `EncryptTargetDirs` function now uses a `switch` statement with `errors.Is` to explicitly handle different types of errors returned by `encryptTargetDir`, allowing for more specific logging and potentially different recovery paths. Upon successful encryption, it now explicitly removes the temporary migration directory.
        *   **Refactored `encryptTargetDir`:** The function's signature was changed to return an `error` directly, and the `tempDir` is now passed as an argument. The internal logic related to `recoveryDir` and `migrateToRecoveryDir` was removed, suggesting a shift in responsibility for recovery management. The import of the `common` package was also removed from this file.

## 4:26:51 AM
The log captures development on an "Integrity Handler" Go application focused on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for key management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go**
    *   **Timestamp:** `11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM` (initial definition) and `11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM` (minor update).
    *   This file defines key directory paths as constants for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (for handler files), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted Filesystem Encryption Master Key), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` for migration, recovery, and manifest data respectively. The later timestamp reflects a minor change to the package-level comment.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple entries on `11/21/2025` at `2:27:15 PM`, `2:27:22 PM`, `2:28:49 PM`, `2:40:35 PM`. The content appears largely identical across these entries in the provided log, suggesting minor saves without functional code changes within the snippets.
    *   This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler. It implements functions to:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Check system requirements (root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command availability, TPM initialization).
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrate the encryption process, including ensuring directories exist, resolving/creating the FEMK (Filesystem Encryption Master Key), setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories. This function is designed to be idempotent.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlock previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Securely retrieve and manage the filesystem key using a `vault.SecureContainer`, explicitly wiping the key from memory after use.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Create required directories with specific permissions and clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Log warnings if data is found in the recovery directory.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go**
    *   **Timestamp:** `11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM`.
    *   This is the application's entry point, defining the `main` function. It sets up logging, parses command-line arguments (specifically a `mount` path), and orchestrates the primary execution flow by calling `run`.
    *   It defines custom `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) for standardized process return values.
    *   The `run` function handles version reporting, environment initialization, calls to `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, and robust error handling to return appropriate exit codes.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go**
    *   **Timestamp:** `11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM` (initial definition) and `11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM` (significant update).
    *   This package provides higher-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
    *   **Initial version (`11/21/2025`)**: Defined various error constants related to encryption processes, `protectorName` as "FEMK", and `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem `fscrypt` configuration. It introduced the `EncryptionResult` struct to track outcomes and `EncryptTargetDirs` to perform the core encryption logic (relocating data, encrypting empty directories, restoring data). It used directory constants from the `common` package.
    *   **Updated version (`11/25/2025`)**:
        *   Added new, more specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) to provide clearer error indications.
        *   Refined the `EncryptionResult` struct by removing `FailedToRecover`, indicating a change in how recovery-related failures are reported or handled. Corresponding changes were made to `newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, and `BuildError` methods.
        *   **Decoupled direct dependency on the `common` package for migration directory paths within `EncryptTargetDirs`** by removing the `common` import and hardcoding the `migration-store` path.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to include a `switch` statement for more granular error handling after calling `encryptTargetDir`, and now performs a cleanup (`fs.RemoveAll(tempDir)`) on successful encryption.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function signature was modified to accept `tempDir` directly, and the `recoveryDir` variable and related `migrateToRecoveryDir` logic were removed, implying a revised error recovery strategy in this function.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   `11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM`: Initial definition of common directory constants.
*   `11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM`: Initial definition of the core `integrity.go` application logic.

The provided code changes primarily revolve around an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity verification, likely for sensitive configuration data. The timestamps span November 21st and November 25th, 2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines essential constants for directory paths used by the Integrity Handler. These paths include `/boot/integrity` (for handler files), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key - FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for integrity manifest files). The initial package comment was slightly malformed.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was clarified to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined directory paths and their purposes remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** through **11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: Across these four timestamps, the content of this file remained identical. It serves as a central component of the Integrity Handler.
        *   It defines an `errIntegrityCompromised` error.
        *   The `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` function ensures the system meets requirements, such as being run as root, kernel version 5.4+, filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata.CheckSupport`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity` is a key function responsible for idempotently preparing the environment, resolving the FEMK, setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting specified target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs` handles unlocking already encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey` securely decrypts and stores the FEMK in a `vault.SecureContainer`, including a key-wiping step for security.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates the necessary migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with appropriate permissions, and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` logs warnings if data is found in the recovery directory, indicating potential issues requiring manual intervention.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the main entry point of the Integrity Handler application.
        *   It defines custom `ExitCode` values for different application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised).
        *   It embeds a version string using `//go:embed`.
        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path flag, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: logging the version, initializing application state, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It specifically uses `DefaultManifest()` as targets for encryption. Error handling maps various failures to the custom `ExitCode`s, notably `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines numerous custom error types related to fscrypt processes (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`).
        *   The `protectorName` is defined as "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount` performs global and filesystem-specific fscrypt setup.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the outcome of encryption attempts for multiple targets.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` iterates through targets, checking if they are already encrypted, and calls `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` implements the core encryption logic: moving contents out, recreating the target directory as empty, encrypting it, and then handling relocation and potential recovery steps. This version used `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath`.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This update introduces significant refactoring within the `fscrypt` package.
        *   **Removal of `common` import**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` package is no longer imported.
        *   **New specific error types**: `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were added, providing more granular error reporting.
        *   **Refactored `EncryptionResult`**: The `FailedToRecover []string` field was removed, indicating a change in how recovery failures are tracked or handled. This change propagates through `newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, and `BuildError` methods.
        *   **Hardcoded paths in `EncryptTargetDirs`**: The `tempDir` path is now hardcoded directly as `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/" + dirName`, replacing the usage of `common.MigrationDirPath`. The `recoveryDir` variable is also removed from this function, streamlining the handling of temporary directories within the `fscrypt` package itself.
        *   **Simplified `encryptTargetDir`**: The function signature changed to remove the `recoveryDir` parameter. Logic related to replicating original directory permissions was removed, and initial permissions for recreated directories are now consistently `0o0750`. Error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` now uses a `switch` statement for the newly defined specific error types.

## 8:26:50 AM
The provided log details code changes for an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity verification. Key updates, file-specific changes, and overall patterns are as follows:

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant directory paths crucial for the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` for handler files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), and dedicated paths under `/opt/128technology/integrity` for migration data, recovery data, and integrity manifest files.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor documentation update occurred, changing the package comment to "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." No functional code changes were introduced.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 2:27:22 PM; 2:28:49 PM; 2:40:35 PM**: This file, serving as the core logic for the Integrity Handler, remained functionally identical across these four timestamps. It implements:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements such as root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: An idempotent function that ensures necessary directories exist, resolves the FEMK, sets up `fscrypt` on the mount point, and initiates encryption of target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories, treating failures as integrity compromises.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading mechanism for the filesystem key, involving FEMK decryption and secure key storage in a `vault.SecureContainer`, followed by wiping the plaintext key.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and cleans the migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with specific permissions.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if data is found in the recovery directory, indicating potential issues requiring manual intervention.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants for various application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible Environment, Integrity Compromised). The `main` function parses a `--mount` path argument, sets up logging, and orchestrates the application's flow. It calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, handling errors and exiting with the appropriate `ExitCode`. It also embeds the application version using `//go:embed`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error types related to encryption failures, directory relocation, and `fscrypt` support. Key functions include `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` configuration, and `EncryptTargetDirs`. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function uses an `EncryptionResult` struct to track outcomes for multiple targets. The `encryptTargetDir` helper function implements the core encryption logic: relocating contents from the target directory to a temporary migration directory, recreating the target as an empty directory with original permissions, encrypting it, and handling errors by moving contents to a recovery directory if encryption fails.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This update introduces significant refactoring and explicit error handling:
        *   New explicit error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by removing the `FailedToRecover` field, and related logic in `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods was updated accordingly.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's error handling for individual target encryption was revamped, moving from direct `result` appending to a `switch` statement on the error returned by `encryptTargetDir`. On success, the temporary migration directory is now explicitly removed.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature changed to explicitly return an `error`, making it more modular. It no longer manages a `recoveryDir` parameter directly and no longer imports the `common` package as hardcoded paths are used for temporary directories.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025**: Multiple files were actively developed and committed. `directories.go` defined critical paths, `integrity.go` established core integrity logic, and `main.go` set up the application entry point. `fscrypt.go` introduced the initial `fscrypt` wrapper logic. The repeated identical timestamps for `integrity.go` suggest a period of active work or repeated saves without functional changes before `main.go` and `fscrypt.go` received their updates.
*   **11/25/2025**: A significant refactoring occurred in `fscrypt.go`, improving error handling, simplifying the `EncryptionResult` struct, and refining the `encryptTargetDir` function's interface and logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright & Ownership**: All files begin with `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`, indicating a common ownership and development environment.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Consistent use of `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.As` is prevalent throughout the codebase, reflecting a commitment to detailed and structured error management.
*   **Logging**: Extensive logging (`log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warnf`, `log.Errorf`) is used across all files to provide visibility into the application's execution flow and state.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `afero.Fs` interface is used for file system operations, allowing for more flexible and testable code by abstracting `os` package functions.
*   **Security Focus**: The application is deeply concerned with security, evident in its reliance on `fscrypt` for encryption, integration with TPM (`tpm.InitializeTPM`), use of `vault.SecureContainer` for key storage, and explicit key wiping (`plainKey[i] = 0`).
*   **Idempotency**: The `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` functions are explicitly designed to be idempotent, ensuring they can be safely re-executed without unintended side effects.
*   **Migration and Recovery**: A clear strategy for handling data during encryption is implemented, involving temporary migration directories (`.migration-store`) and recovery directories (`migration-recovery`) to mitigate data loss during failures.

## 9:26:50 AM
The provided log details changes across several Go source files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity verification.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file defines several constant paths crucial for the Integrity Handler, including `BootDirPath`, `EncryptedKeyPath` (for the FEMK - File Encryption Master Key), `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`. It initially includes a comment hinting at a secure container for keys using mmap'ed and mlocked memory.
    *   **Update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** A minor, non-functional change occurred where the package-level comment was updated from a detailed description of the secure container to a more general statement: "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial and subsequent updates (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM):** This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler. It imports `fscrypt`, `tpm`, and `vault` packages for cryptographic operations and secure key storage. Key functions include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements such as root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt.CheckSupport`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: An idempotent function that ensures necessary directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`), manages the FEMK, sets up `fscrypt` on the mount, and then encrypts target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Responsible for unlocking previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function that decrypts the FEMK and stores it in a `vault.SecureContainer`, ensuring the original plain key slice is wiped for security.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and sets permissions for several integrity-related directories, and attempts to clean the `MigrationDirPath`.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for contents in the `RecoveryDirPath` and logs warnings if items are found, indicating potential data loss requiring manual intervention.
    *   Notably, the multiple log entries for this file on `11/21/2025` with slightly different timestamps show identical code content, indicating no functional changes were made during those specific saves.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This is the entry point of the Integrity Handler application.
        *   It defines custom `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for process termination.
        *   Uses `//go:embed` to include a version string.
        *   The `main` function parses a `mount` path flag, sets up logging, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: logs the version, initializes application state, calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It maps errors from these functions to the appropriate `ExitCode` values, particularly `ExitIncompatible` for environment issues and `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations or failed unlocks.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines a set of `var` errors for various `fscrypt` failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`).
        *   `protectorName` is defined as "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount` handles global `fscrypt` configuration and filesystem-specific setup.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the outcome of encryption attempts for multiple targets, categorizing them into `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, and various failure types (`FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRestore`, `FailedToRecover`). It includes `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` orchestrates the encryption of multiple directories, skipping already encrypted ones and calling `encryptTargetDir` for each.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` involves relocating directory contents to a temporary location, recreating the target directory with original permissions, encrypting the empty target, and then managing content migration or recovery in case of failures.
    *   **Significant update (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
        *   New explicit `var` error definitions were added for `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore`, making error handling more explicit.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was modified to remove the `FailedToRecover` field and its related logic from `newEncryptionResult`, `Failed()`, and `BuildError()`.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was refactored: it removed the import of the `common` package and hardcoded the migration store path (`"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`). It also introduced a `switch` statement to handle different `encryptTargetDir` errors more granularly and includes cleanup logic to remove temporary directories on success.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function signature was updated to accept the `tempDir` as an argument, and the internal handling of recovery (specifically the call to `migrateToRecoveryDir`) was removed, suggesting a change in recovery strategy or deferral of that logic.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial implementation of common directory paths in `directories.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** Initial core logic for the Integrity Handler application in `integrity.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** Implementation of the main application entry point and orchestration in `main.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** Minor documentation update in `directories.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** Initial detailed implementation of `fscrypt` wrapper functions and encryption result tracking in `fscrypt.go`.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** A substantial refactoring of `fscrypt.go`, improving error handling specificity, modifying the `EncryptionResult` structure, and changing the approach to temporary directory management and recovery within the encryption process (e.g., hardcoding paths, removing `FailedToRecover` status).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice:** All files consistently include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`.
*   **Security Focus:** The codebase frequently refers to "Integrity Handler," "secure container," "FEMK" (File Encryption Master Key), TPM integration, and explicitly wipes sensitive key data from memory, indicating a strong emphasis on data security and system integrity.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** There is a pervasive pattern of detailed error management using `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.Join` to provide clear, chained, and specific error messages. Custom error types are defined for various failure scenarios.
*   **Idempotency:** The `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` functions are explicitly commented as needing to be idempotent, which is a critical design consideration for system-level operations to ensure consistent state after multiple executions.
*   **Filesystem Interaction:** The `afero` library is heavily used for abstracting filesystem operations, and the `fscrypt` library is central to the encryption logic, suggesting a core responsibility of managing and securing parts of the filesystem.
*   **Directory Structure:** A consistent set of specialized directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are managed and referenced across the `common`, `integrity`, and `fscrypt` packages.
*   **Logging:** The `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) is used extensively for debugging, informational, warning, and error messages throughout the application flow.

        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Retrieves the filesystem key, decrypting the FEMK and storing it in a `vault.SecureContainer` (with memory wiping for the plain key).
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and sets permissions for all required directories, including cleaning up the `MigrationDirPath`.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if data is found in the `RecoveryDirPath`.
    *   The content of this file remained consistent across the four timestamps on `11/21/2025`, suggesting saves or minor non-functional changes during development.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This file introduces the main entry point (`main` function) and the primary execution logic (`run` function) for the Integrity Handler.
        *   It defines custom `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) aligned with systemd service return values.
        *   The `main` function sets logging, parses a `mount` command-line flag, and calls `run`.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: logs version, initializes application state, calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes logic to handle different error types and return appropriate `ExitCode` values, explicitly checking for `errIntegrityCompromised`.
        *   A `TODO` comment highlights the need to process manifests from `manifest.d` and plumb the `path` argument through encryption/unlocking functions.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file introduces high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` internals.
        *   It defines numerous package-level error constants (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`).
        *   `protectorName` is set to "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Performs global `fscrypt` configuration and filesystem setup on a given mount path, ensuring idempotence.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: A critical component designed to track the detailed outcome of encryption attempts (Success, AlreadyEncrypted, FailedToRelocate, FailedToEncrypt, FailedToUnlock, FailedToRestore, FailedToRecover). Includes `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through target directories, checks if already encrypted, and calls `encryptTargetDir` for actual encryption.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Contains the detailed steps for encrypting a directory: moving its contents to a temporary location (`MigrationDirPath`), recreating the target as an empty directory, encrypting it, and handling recovery in case of failures during relocation or encryption.
    *   **Major refactoring (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):** This update represents a significant restructuring and refinement of the `fscrypt` package's error handling and control flow.
        *   **New Error Constants:** `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` are explicitly defined at the package level, making error reporting more granular.
        *   **`EncryptionResult` struct changes:** The `FailedToRecover` field was removed, and associated logic in `newEncryptionResult`, `Failed()`, and `BuildError()` was updated.
        *   **`EncryptTargetDirs` refactoring:** This function now directly receives and handles errors returned by `encryptTargetDir` using a `switch` statement for specific error types (Relocate, Encrypt, Unlock, Restore). It also introduces explicit cleanup (`fs.RemoveAll(tempDir)`) if encryption is successful. The `tempDir` path is hardcoded temporarily (with a `TODO` to use `common.MigrationDirPath`).
        *   **`encryptTargetDir` refactoring:** This function is simplified to return an `error` directly instead of modifying the `result` struct. The recovery directory logic (`recoveryDir`, `migrateToRecoveryDir`) and direct appending to `result.FailedToEncrypt` were removed, shifting error handling responsibility upstream to `EncryptTargetDirs`.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial definition of common directory paths in `common/directories.go`.

## 11:26:49 AM
The provided log details the development of a Go application named "Integrity Handler" by Juniper Networks, focused on ensuring system integrity through filesystem encryption.

**File-specific updates and timestamps:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially created, defining critical constant paths used by the Integrity Handler. These include `BootDirPath` (`/boot/integrity`), `EncryptedKeyPath` (`/boot/integrity/femk.enc`), `MigrationDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`), `RecoveryDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`), and `ManifestDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`). The package comment indicates its role in holding secure keys and common variables.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update to the package-level comment, generalizing its description from "secure container... and common variables" to "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined directory paths remain unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM**: Multiple log entries for this file within a short timeframe (2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM) show no functional code changes across these versions. This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler. Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking prerequisites like root user, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support via `fscrypt/metadata`, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (orchestrates directory creation, FEMK resolution, `fscrypt` setup, and directory encryption), `unlockEncryptedDirs` (for accessing encrypted content), `getFsKey` (securely loading and wiping the filesystem key), `ensureDirectoriesExist` (creating and cleaning the specified common directories), and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` (logging issues in recovery directories).

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file was introduced, providing the main entry point for the application. It defines standard `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) aligning with `systemd` conventions. The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mountPath` flag, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the application's flow, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs` from `integrity.go`. It handles various error conditions by returning appropriate `ExitCode` values.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file was initially created, providing high-level Go wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error constants for various encryption-related failures. Key functions include `SetupOnMount` (for global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup) and `EncryptTargetDirs`. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the status of encryption attempts across multiple targets. The `encryptTargetDir` function outlines the process: relocating contents to a temporary directory (`common.MigrationDirPath`), recreating the target directory, encrypting it, and handling relocation failures.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A significant update several days later. The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` import was removed. Consequently, the temporary directory path within `EncryptTargetDirs` was hardcoded to `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`. New explicit error constants like `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were added. The `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were refactored to remove the `FailedToRecover` field. The `encryptTargetDir` function was updated to accept the `tempDir` as a parameter and removed the `recoveryDir` related logic, indicating a streamlined approach to temporary file management and error recovery within this package.

## 12:26:49 PM
The log details the evolution of a Go application named "Integrity Handler," primarily focused on filesystem encryption and integrity verification.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** This file defines essential constants for directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key), and paths for migration, recovery, and manifest storage within `/opt/128technology/integrity`. The initial package comment noted its role in holding secure keys using mmap'ed and mlocked memory.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** A minor change occurred, updating the package comment to a more general "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," removing the specific mention of secure containers and mmap'ed memory, though the directory constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** This entry introduces the core logic of the Integrity Handler. It includes functions for `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking prerequisites like root user, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` tool presence, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (which sets up directories, resolves/decrypts the FEMK, configures `fscrypt` for the mount point, and encrypts target directories), `unlockEncryptedDirs`, and `getFsKey` (for securely loading and managing the FEMK). Helper functions like `ensureDirectoriesExist` and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` are also defined here.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM:** These timestamps show no functional or content changes to the file. They represent identical snapshots of the code.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** This file provides the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines custom `ExitCode` constants (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with systemd service return codes. The `main` function sets up logging, parses a `--mount` flag, and delegates execution to the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the application flow by calling the `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs` functions, returning an appropriate `ExitCode` based on the outcome, including specific codes for environmental incompatibility or integrity compromise.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** This is the initial version of the fscrypt wrapper package. It defines various error types related to encryption operations. Key functionalities include `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific fscrypt configuration, and `EncryptTargetDirs`. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function, through its helper `encryptTargetDir`, implements a multi-step process: moving existing directory contents to a temporary location, recreating the target directory, encrypting the empty target, and then moving the original contents back. It tracks the results (successes and various failures like relocation, encryption, and recovery issues) in an `EncryptionResult` struct. Error recovery often involved moving data to recovery directories.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** This timestamp marks a significant refactoring in error handling and path management. The import of the `common` package is removed, leading to `TODO` comments indicating that migration paths need to be explicitly passed into functions (currently using a hardcoded path). Several new distinct error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) are introduced. The `EncryptionResult` struct is simplified by removing `FailedToRecover`. The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature changes to accept `tempDir`, and its internal logic for handling and returning errors is updated; it now returns errors directly, which are then handled by a `switch` statement in `EncryptTargetDirs`. The specific logic for creating and using recovery directories within `encryptTargetDir` is removed, suggesting a shift in recovery strategy to a higher level or a different mechanism.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Copyright:** All files include the "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." notice.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code consistently uses Go's `errors` package, employing `fmt.Errorf` for error wrapping and `errors.Is`/`errors.As` for precise error type checking, indicating a focus on clear and actionable error reporting.
*   **Detailed Logging:** Extensive use of a custom `log` package (e.g., `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warn`, `log.Errorf`) provides granular insights into the application's execution flow and potential issues.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** `github.com/spf13/afero` is used for abstracting filesystem operations, making the code potentially more testable and flexible.
*   **Security as a Core Concern:** Mentions of "secure container," TPM initialization, and `fscrypt` for encryption throughout the codebase highlight security and data integrity as primary objectives.
*   **Directory Path Management:** Directory paths are consistently managed via named constants defined in `common/directories.go`, promoting maintainability, although the `fscrypt` package temporarily moved away from direct `common` import in its latest change, with `TODO`s suggesting re-integration or alternative path management.
*   **Idempotency:** Key operations like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be safely run multiple times without unintended side effects.
*   **Ongoing Development:** Numerous `TODO` comments indicate areas for future work, particularly around refining error recovery mechanisms and externalizing configuration like migration paths.

## 1:26:47 PM
The provided logs detail changes across several Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focused on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM for key management.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**

These include `/boot/integrity` for handler files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted FEMK, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration, recovery, and manifest directories.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update was made to the package-level comment, clarifying its purpose from "Package container common a secure container to hold our key at runtime..." to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM**: This file, implementing the core logic of the Integrity Handler, shows multiple timestamps with largely identical content in the provided snippets. This suggests either frequent saves without functional changes or very subtle modifications not captured by the diff.
    *   The file defines core functions:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements like root user, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`), presence of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Ensures necessary directories exist, creates and resolves the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), sets up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypts target directories. It's explicitly noted as needing to be idempotent.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Decrypts the FEMK and stores it in a secure container, then securely wipes the plaintext key from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and sets permissions for critical directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks and logs warnings if any contents are found in the recovery directory.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point.
    *   It defines custom `ExitCode` values (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with systemd service return codes.
    *   Embeds the application version using `//go:embed integrity-handler.version`.
    *   The `main` function parses a `mount` path, sets the log level, calls the `run` function, and exits with the appropriate `ExitCode`.
    *   The `run` function orchestrates the initialization (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), directory integrity checks (`handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`), and the core encryption/unlock process (`enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`). It includes specific error handling to distinguish between environmental incompatibility, integrity compromise, and generic failures.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
    *   Defines numerous error constants for various failure scenarios during encryption, relocation, and restoration.
    *   `SetupOnMount`: Handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup.
    *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct to track the success and different categories of failures (e.g., `FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRecover`). It provides `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: The main function to encrypt directories, iterating through targets and calling `encryptTargetDir`. It's explicitly marked as needing to be idempotent.
    *   `encryptTargetDir`: Contains logic to temporarily move directory contents, recreate the target directory, encrypt it, and handle potential recovery. The snippet ends mid-function, indicating more logic existed.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This timestamp marks a significant refactoring:
        *   **Removal of import**: The import `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` was removed, implying `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath` are no longer directly used within this file.
        *   **New Error Definitions**: Explicit error variables `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were added, formalizing error types previously categorized within `EncryptionResult`.
        *   **`EncryptionResult` Changes**: The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and associated methods (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`), indicating a change in how recovery failures are tracked or handled.
        *   **`EncryptTargetDirs` Refactoring**: The function was updated to pass `tempDir` as an argument to `encryptTargetDir` and includes a `switch` statement for specific error handling and logging after `encryptTargetDir` returns. It also attempts to `RemoveAll(tempDir)` on success. The temporary directory path (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`) is now hardcoded or a placeholder within this function instead of relying on the `common` package constant.
        *   **`encryptTargetDir` Signature Change**: The function now accepts `tempDir string` as an argument.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright**: All files are consistently copyrighted "Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025."
*   **Security Focus**: The codebase heavily emphasizes security, involving `fscrypt` for encryption, TPM for key management, secure container usage for keys, and explicit key wiping (`plainKey[i] = 0`).
*   **Path Management**: Extensive use of `/boot/integrity` and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` paths for operational and state persistence, including encrypted keys, migration, and recovery data.
*   **Error Handling**: Consistent and detailed error handling using Go's `errors` package, including `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.Join` for robust error propagation and classification.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly documented as needing to be idempotent, crucial for reliable system operations.
*   **Dependencies**: Strong reliance on `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption, `github.com/spf13/afero` for filesystem abstractions, and internal Juniper-SSN packages for logging (`log`) and secure key handling (`vault`, `tpm`).
*   **Timestamps**: The changes are concentrated on 11/21/2025, with a significant refactoring occurring a few days later on 11/25/2025, indicating focused development efforts within a short period.

## 2:26:49 PM
The `common/directories.go` file, first seen at 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM, defines several constant paths crucial for the Integrity Handler application, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted FEMK), and directories under `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration data, recovery, and manifests. On 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM, its package comment was updated for clarity.

The `integrity.go` file saw multiple updates on 11/21/2025 (2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM). The initial detailed entry (2:27:15 PM) established the core logic of the Integrity Handler. This includes `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` to check for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt/metadata`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization. Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` handle the encryption and decryption processes, utilizing a `vault.SecureContainer` for key management and ensuring necessary directories are created and cleaned. Subsequent timestamps for this file on the same day show no functional code changes, suggesting minor non-code alterations or repeated saves.

The `main.go` file, first logged on 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM, serves as the application's entry point. It sets up logging, parses command-line arguments (specifically a `-mount` path), and orchestrates the application's lifecycle via the `run` function. It defines specific `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) to signal various outcomes, including environmental incompatibility or detected integrity violations. The application version is embedded using `//go:embed`.

The `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` file underwent significant changes. Its initial state on 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM, introduced functions like `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem fscrypt configuration, and `EncryptTargetDirs` to manage the encryption of specified directories. This initial implementation included detailed error types and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track success and various failure modes (e.g., `FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRestore`, `FailedToRecover`). The `encryptTargetDir` function handled the relocation of contents, recreation of empty target directories, and their encryption. A major refactoring occurred on 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM. This update removed the direct import of the `common` package, added more explicit error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`), and simplified the `EncryptionResult` struct by removing `FailedToRecover`. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to use a `switch` statement for better structured error handling and to remove temporary directories upon success. The `encryptTargetDir` function was also refactored to remove internal `recoveryDir` logic, suggesting a shift in how recovery scenarios are managed within the Integrity Handler.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All files consistently include a `Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` header.
*   **Integrity Handler Core**: The code is entirely focused on a "Integrity Handler" application, emphasizing filesystem encryption, secure key management (FEMK, TPM integration), and robust directory handling.
*   **Go Language & Ecosystem**: The codebase is written in Go, making extensive use of standard library packages (e.g., `context`, `errors`, `os`) and external libraries like `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption, `github.com/spf13/afero` for filesystem operations, and a custom `log` package.
*   **Structured Error Handling**: There's a strong pattern of defining custom error types and using `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.As` for clear, composable, and traceable error management.
*   **Directory Path Constants**: The `common/directories.go` file centralizes important filesystem paths, promoting maintainability and consistency across the application. These paths include locations for boot files, encrypted keys, migration data, recovery data, and manifest files.
*   **Idempotency Requirement**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly noted as needing to be idempotent, ensuring they can be run multiple times without unintended side effects.
*   **Security Focus**: The mention of a "secure container" for keys and wiping sensitive key data (`plainKey[i] = 0`) highlights a strong emphasis on security.
*   **Development Timeline**: All recorded changes fall within November 2025, indicating an active development period for this project.

## 3:26:51 PM
The provided log details changes across three Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on filesystem encryption and security.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defined core constant directory paths for the Integrity Handler. These included `/boot/integrity` for boot-related integrity files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), and paths under `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration data, recovery data, and integrity manifests. The package comment described its role in holding secure keys.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor, non-functional change updated the package comment to a more general description: "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constant directory paths remained the same.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM**: This file contains the main logic for verifying the system environment, enabling, and unlocking filesystem integrity. It ensures the application runs as root, checks for a minimum kernel version (5.4), verifies filesystem encryption support via `fscrypt`, and initializes the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) for key encryption. Functions like `enableIntegrity` manage directory creation, key resolution (FEMK), fscrypt setup, and encryption of target directories. `unlockEncryptedDirs` handles unlocking. `getFsKey` securely decrypts and stores the filesystem key. `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates necessary directories with specific permissions and cleans the migration store. `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` checks for lingering data in the recovery directory. No functional changes were observed across these timestamps.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point. It defines custom `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for different program outcomes. The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mountPath` flag, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the integrity process by logging the application version, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs` on a set of default targets, handling errors and returning specific exit codes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file implements high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines several error types related to encryption failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`). It includes `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem fscrypt setup and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track the success or failure of various steps in the encryption process for multiple target directories. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function outlines a multi-step process: moving contents out of the target, recreating the target directory, encrypting it, and then moving the original contents back. Initial error handling included attempting to recover contents to a designated recovery directory.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This update significantly refactored error handling and path management.
        *   **Error Handling Refinement:** New comments were added to existing error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) for improved clarity. The `FailedToRecover` field and related logic were removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its methods, simplifying how recovery failures are tracked at this level.
        *   **Decoupling from `common`:** The import for the `common` package was removed from this file. Consequently, paths like `MigrationDirPath` are no longer directly referenced through `common` but are either hardcoded (e.g., `tempDir` set to `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/" + dirName`) or managed differently.
        *   **Enhanced Error Flow:** The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated with a `switch` statement to explicitly handle and log different error types returned by the `encryptTargetDir` function (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore). Successful encryption now includes an explicit step to remove the temporary migration directory.
        *   **Recovery Logic Shift:** All direct references to a `recoveryDir` and the `migrateToRecoveryDir` function within `encryptTargetDir` were removed, suggesting that the responsibility for handling specific recovery scenarios for encryption failures has been moved or altered.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **November 21, 2025, between 2:26:50 PM and 4:11:30 PM**: Initial comprehensive development phase where the core structure, directory definitions, environmental checks, main application flow, and the initial fscrypt integration were established.
*   **November 25, 2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A focused refactoring effort on the `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` file, streamlining error reporting, removing direct `common` package dependency for paths, and adjusting the recovery logic.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright Notices:** All code files consistently begin with a "Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025" copyright notice.
*   **Integrity Handler Core:** The entire codebase revolves around an "Integrity Handler" application designed to secure system files through encryption, reflecting a clear product focus.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** There is a consistent pattern of comprehensive error handling using Go's `errors` package, `fmt.Errorf` for wrapping errors, and custom error types, with specific refinements seen in the `fscrypt.go` changes.
*   **Directory-Based Operations:** Frequent creation, cleanup, and interaction with specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are central to the application's functionality.
*   **External Dependencies:** Heavy reliance on `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption and `github.com/spf13/afero` for abstract filesystem operations is a recurring pattern, indicating a robust and testable approach to filesystem security.
*   **Security Focus:** Concepts like FEMK, TPM initialization, secure containers for keys (using mmap/mlock), and explicit key-wiping after use highlight a strong emphasis on security best practices.
*   **Idempotency:** Explicit mentions that key functions (`enableIntegrity`, `EncryptTargetDirs`) "must be idempotent" indicate a design goal for robust operation even if called multiple times or after partial failures.

## 4:26:50 PM
The provided logs detail changes across several Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, developed by Juniper Networks. The core purpose of this application appears to be enforcing filesystem integrity through encryption, using `fscrypt` and TPM for key management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** This file was initially defined, establishing constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` for handler files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), and directories under `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration data, recovery data, and integrity manifest files (`.migration-store`, `migration-recovery`, `manifest.d`).
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** A minor comment update occurred in the package declaration, clarifying its purpose as containing "common globals" rather than details about secure containers. The constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** This entry represents the initial implementation of the core Integrity Handler logic. It defines functions to:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Check system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrate the encryption process, including creating necessary directories, resolving/decrypting the FEMK, setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlock encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Securely retrieve and store the decrypted FEMK.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Create required application directories with specific permissions and clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Log warnings if contents are found in the recovery directory.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM:** No functional changes were observed; the code content remained identical to the previous entry.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM:** A minor change was introduced in `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, removing an explicit `afero.Exists` check. The function now directly attempts to read the recovery directory, logging warnings if it encounters issues or finds contents.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM:** No functional changes were observed; the code content remained identical to the previous entry.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** This file was introduced as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes (success, generic failure, incompatible environment, integrity compromised). The `main` function parses a `-mount` flag, calls `run`, and handles exit codes. The `run` function orchestrates the application's main flow: logging version, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity for default targets, and then unlocking any already encrypted directories.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** This file was initially defined, providing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It included:
        *   Numerous error constants for various failure scenarios during encryption.
        *   `SetupOnMount` function for idempotent fscrypt setup on a given mount path.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct to track the success or failure of encrypting multiple target directories, categorizing different types of failures (relocation, encryption, unlocking, restoring).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` function, which iterates targets and calls `encryptTargetDir` for individual encryption. `encryptTargetDir` involves moving contents to a temporary directory, recreating the target directory, encrypting it, and handling potential recovery to a specific directory if creation fails.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** A significant refactoring occurred:
        *   The import of `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` was removed.
        *   New specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced, replacing or formalizing existing error conditions.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and associated methods (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`) were updated to remove tracking for `FailedToRecover`.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was modified to explicitly handle the `error` returned by `encryptTargetDir` using a `switch` statement and to perform cleanup of the temporary directory on success. The `tempDir` path was hardcoded within `EncryptTargetDirs` instead of relying on the `common` package.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` now accepts `tempDir` as a parameter and removed the logic for moving contents to a `recoveryDir` directly within the function, implying this recovery handling might be externalized or re-evaluated.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, ~2:27 PM - 2:40 PM:** Initial setup and minor refinements of the core `IntegrityHandler` logic in `integrity.go`, including directory management and environment checks.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** Introduction of the `main.go` file, establishing the application's command-line interface and overall execution flow.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** Initial implementation of the `fscrypt` wrapper logic, detailing the encryption process for target directories.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** A significant refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, focusing on improved error handling, a more explicit error return from the core encryption function, and changes in how temporary and recovery paths are managed, indicating a push towards greater robustness and clearer error reporting in the encryption subsystem.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright & Ownership:** All files include a "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." header, indicating consistent ownership and licensing.
*   **Go Modules & Imports:** The code heavily relies on Go's module system, importing standard libraries (`context`, `errors`, `fmt`, `os`, `path/filepath`, `os/exec`) and third-party libraries (`github.com/google/fscrypt`, `github.com/spf13/afero`). It also uses internal packages (`common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`, `log`).
*   **Integrity and Security Focus:** The application's name "Integrity Handler" and its functions (TPM initialization, FEMK encryption, secure key storage in `vault.SecureContainer`, kernel/filesystem checks for encryption support) consistently highlight a strong focus on system integrity and data security.
*   **Idempotency:** Specific functions, like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly designed and commented to be idempotent, ensuring repeated calls have the same effect as a single call.
*   **Error Handling:** A robust error handling pattern is evident, utilizing `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` for wrapping errors, and `errors.Is`/`errors.As` for checking specific error types. There's a clear effort to categorize and report different failure scenarios.
*   **Directory Management & Cleanup:** The application consistently manages specific directories for its operations (migration, recovery, manifests) and includes logic for their creation, permission setting, and cleanup.
*   **Future-Dating:** All timestamps are in late 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date. This might indicate planned development or a synthetic log.

## 5:26:52 PM
The provided log details changes across several Go source files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity management.

### File-specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** This file was initially defined, establishing constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler. These paths include `/boot/integrity` (for boot files and the encrypted FEMK), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` (for migration, recovery, and manifest storage). The package comment highlighted its role in holding secure keys at runtime.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** A minor update occurred, changing the package comment to a more generic description of containing "common globals" throughout the Integrity Handler, without altering the constants themselves.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM (and subsequent identical entries until 2:40:35 PM):** This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler. It includes functions for:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, including ensuring necessary directories exist, creating/decrypting the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Manages the secure loading of the filesystem key using a `vault.SecureContainer` and safely wiping the key data afterwards.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and cleans various operational directories like migration, recovery, and manifest paths.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for data in the recovery directory and logs warnings if manual intervention is needed.
    *   This file remained functionally unchanged across the multiple identical timestamps on 11/21/2025.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** This file introduces the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants that align with systemd service return values, enabling granular reporting of success, generic failure, incompatibility, or integrity compromise. The `main` function parses a mount path, sets up logging, and invokes the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates calls to `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, translating internal errors into the appropriate `ExitCode` for process termination.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** This file implemented high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` functionality. It defined a set of specific error types for various failure conditions during encryption (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), a `SetupOnMount` function for `fscrypt` configuration, and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track the success or failure status of multiple directory encryption attempts. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function iterated through targets, checking their encryption status and calling `encryptTargetDir` to handle the relocation, encryption, and potential recovery of contents.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** This entry shows a significant refactoring:
        *   The import for `common` package was removed.
        *   New specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by removing the `FailedToRecover` field.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's logic was revised to handle errors from `encryptTargetDir` using a `switch` statement for more precise failure categorization. It also gained logic to explicitly remove temporary migration directories upon successful encryption. A `TODO` comment was added to address the hardcoding of migration paths due to the `common` package removal.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function was modified to return a single `error` instead of modifying the `EncryptionResult` directly. Its parameters were updated, removing `result *EncryptionResult` and adding `tempDir string`, indicating a shift in error aggregation and recovery responsibility to the caller.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial creation of `directories.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** Initial core logic for Integrity Handler defined in `integrity.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** Introduction of the `main.go` application entry point and system exit code handling.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** Initial implementation of `fscrypt` wrapper functions.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** A major refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, impacting error handling, recovery logic, and dependency management (removal of `common` package import). This represents the latest and most significant set of changes in the provided log.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright & Ownership:** All files consistently include the copyright `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Logging:** The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is widely used across all files for debugging, informational, warning, and error messages, providing consistent application observability.
*   **Error Handling:** There's a strong emphasis on detailed error handling using Go's `errors` package features (e.g., `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, `errors.Is`, `errors.Join`) to distinguish between different failure types and propagate context. Specific application exit codes are tied to these error types.
*   **Filesystem Interaction:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is frequently used for abstracting filesystem operations, suggesting a design choice for improved testability and flexibility.
*   **Security Focus:** Recurring themes involve the use of `vault.SecureContainer` for key management, TPM integration for FEMK encryption, and explicit handling of integrity compromises. Secure directory permissions (`0o750`, `0o700`) are also consistently applied.
*   **Idempotency:** Several key functions, such as `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly designed or commented as needing to be idempotent, ensuring they can be run multiple times without unintended side effects.
*   **Directory Management:** Specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are repeatedly referenced and managed for the secure operation of the Integrity Handler.
*   **`TODO` Comments:** The codebase frequently uses `TODO` comments to mark areas for future improvement, such as implementing best-effort shredding, refining context plumbing, processing manifests, and addressing the hardcoded migration path.
