# Activity Summary for 11/30/2025

## 12:26:49 AM
The provided code changes detail the development and refinement of an Integrity Handler application, primarily focusing on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and secure key management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially defined, establishing constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler. These paths include `/boot/integrity` for handler files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), and dedicated directories under `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration data, recovery data, and integrity manifest files.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update occurred, changing the package comment from describing a "secure container" to a more general "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined directory paths and their values remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This log captures the initial detailed implementation of the Integrity Handler's core logic. It imports several internal packages (`common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`) and external libraries (`fscrypt`, `afero`, `log`). Key functions include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process by ensuring directories exist, resolving the FEMK, setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Manages the unlocking of encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Securely loads the filesystem key into a `vault.SecureContainer` and wipes the plaintext key.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and cleans essential directories.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if data is found in the recovery directory.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**, **2:28:49 PM**, **2:40:35 PM**: The content of this file remained identical across these three timestamps in the provided log. This indicates multiple save operations without functional code changes within this period.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This new file was introduced, providing the entry point (`main` function) for the Integrity Handler. It defines custom `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes (success, failure, incompatible environment, compromised integrity). The `run` function coordinates the application's lifecycle, including version logging, environment verification, directory warning handling, enabling integrity, and unlocking directories, mapping various failures to appropriate exit codes. It also demonstrates embedding version information using `//go:embed`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This log entry provides the initial structure for the `fscrypt` wrapper package. It defines a suite of specific error types related to fscrypt operations (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`). It includes `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific fscrypt configuration, and the `EncryptionResult` struct to track detailed outcomes of encryption attempts. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function outlines the process of relocating data, creating empty directories, encrypting them, and managing success or various failure states, with a focus on idempotency. The `encryptTargetDir` function is introduced to perform the core encryption logic for a single directory. This version imports `common`.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This update brings significant refactoring to the `fscrypt` package:
        *   The import of `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` is removed, suggesting internal path management changes within this package or externalization of path definitions.
        *   New specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) are explicitly defined for clearer error handling.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its related methods (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`) are updated to remove tracking for `FailedToRecover`, streamlining the result reporting.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function is refactored to explicitly pass `tempDir` to `encryptTargetDir` and introduces a `switch` statement to handle distinct error types returned by `encryptTargetDir`. Successful encryption now explicitly triggers the removal of temporary migration directories.
        *   The snippet of `encryptTargetDir` shows the removal of `recoveryDir` calculation and its usage within the function, reflecting the changes in error recovery strategy.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directory paths (`directories.go`).
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial detailed implementation of the Integrity Handler's core logic (`integrity.go`).

*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of the `fscrypt` wrapper package, including error types and encryption workflow.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, involving removal of `common` import, introduction of more granular error types, and significant changes to the `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions, particularly regarding temporary and recovery directory handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All files consistently include the copyright `(c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`.
*   **Integrity Handler Application**: The core purpose across all files is the "Integrity Handler" application, focused on ensuring system integrity, especially through filesystem encryption.
*   **`fscrypt` Integration**: There is heavy reliance on the `github.com/google/fscrypt` library for underlying encryption functionalities.
*   **Secure Key Management**: Concepts like FEMK (File Encryption Master Key) and `vault.SecureContainer` are central, indicating a strong focus on secure handling and storage of encryption keys. Functions like `getFsKey` demonstrate wiping plaintext keys after use.
*   **Directory Management**: A consistent pattern of defining and managing specific directories for application files, encrypted keys, migration, recovery, and manifests (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/...`) is observed.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Go's `errors` package, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.As` are extensively used for detailed and structured error reporting. The `EncryptionResult` struct exemplifies a pattern for reporting granular outcomes of multi-target operations.
*   **Idempotency Principle**: Comments explicitly state that key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are designed to be idempotent, ensuring they can be run multiple times without unintended side effects.
*   **Logging**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is used consistently for debugging, informational, warning, and error messages throughout the application.

## 1:26:47 AM
The log details development activity for an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity management. The changes span several files, all within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler` directory, occurring over a short period in November 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file defines constant string paths used throughout the Integrity Handler application, such as `BootDirPath`, `EncryptedKeyPath` (the path to the encrypted File Encryption Master Key - FEMK), `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`. These paths specify locations for various operational data and files related to the integrity system.
    *   **Minor update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** The package-level comment was updated from describing the package as containing a "secure container" to stating it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," refining its documentation. The defined paths remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Multiple timestamps (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 2:27:22 PM; 2:28:49 PM; 2:40:35 PM):** This file consistently defines the core logic for the Integrity Handler. No functional code changes are observed across these entries, indicating stability in this component during this period. Key functions include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`), and TPM/vTPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: An idempotent function to ensure necessary directories exist, resolve the FEMK, set up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypt target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking encrypted directories, considering failures as integrity violations.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function for retrieving the filesystem key from a secure container.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and cleans application-specific directories like migration, recovery, and manifest paths with appropriate permissions.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for contents in the recovery directory, logging warnings if data is found, suggesting manual intervention.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Update (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This is the application's entry point. It initializes logging, parses a `mountPath` flag, and defines `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes (success, generic failure, incompatible environment, integrity compromised). The `run` function orchestrates the main flow, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes a placeholder `DefaultManifest()` for target directories and robust error handling to return specific `ExitCode`s. The version is embedded from `integrity-handler.version`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file provides high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error constants (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem setup, and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track the success and various failure modes of encryption operations, including `FailedToRecover`. The `encryptTargetDir` function outlines the process of relocating contents, recreating the target directory, encrypting it, and handling recovery in case of failures. It imports `common` for directory paths.
    *   **Significant update (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):** This version introduces several refinements to error handling and the encryption process:
        *   **New Error Types:** Added specific error constants `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`.
        *   **`EncryptionResult` Refinement:** The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct, and consequently from its `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods. The `BuildError()` method was updated to account for the newly introduced specific failure types.
        *   **Import Change:** The import of the `common` package was removed. This is a notable change, as it implies `fscrypt.go` will no longer directly reference paths like `common.MigrationDirPath` from that package.
        *   **`EncryptTargetDirs` Refactor:** The logic within `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to explicitly handle specific `encryptTargetDir` return errors using a `switch` statement, logging different debug messages for each. It also introduces a hardcoded `tempDir` path (`"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/" + dirName`), replacing the previous reliance on `common.MigrationDirPath`. On success, it now explicitly removes the temporary directory.
        *   **`encryptTargetDir` Adaptation:** While the provided snippet is truncated, the signature of `encryptTargetDir` was updated to accept `tempDir` as an argument, reflecting the refactoring to handle temporary paths more directly within `fscrypt.go`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** Initial commit/state of `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, detailing `fscrypt` integration.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** A significant update to `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, indicating a refactoring of error handling, removal of `common` package dependency, and more explicit management of temporary directories within its functions. This is the most recent and substantial functional change.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Go Language and Juniper Copyright:** All files are Go source code, prefixed with a "Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025" copyright notice.
*   **Integrity and Encryption Focus:** The overarching theme is the "Integrity Handler" responsible for secure filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and leveraging TPM/vTPM for key management (evident through imports of `tpm` and `vault` packages).
*   **Robust Error Handling:** There is a strong emphasis on defining specific error types (e.g., `errIntegrityCompromised`, `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`), using `errors.Is` and `errors.Join` for detailed error propagation, and handling different failure scenarios with distinct `ExitCode`s. The `fscrypt.go` changes show an evolution towards even more granular error tracking.
*   **Logging:** The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is extensively used across all files for debugging, informational messages, warnings, and errors.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is consistently used for filesystem operations, providing an abstraction layer.
*   **Directory Management:** Repeated patterns of creating, cleaning, and managing specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) for various stages of the integrity process.
*   **Idempotency:** Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent.
*   **Context Propagation:** `context.Context` is passed through many functions, indicating support for cancellation and timeouts.
*   **Refactoring in `fscrypt.go`:** The change in `fscrypt.go` to remove the `common` import and hardcode paths suggests a move towards making the `fscrypt` package more self-contained or to resolve potential architectural dependencies.

## 2:26:48 AM
The log details changes across the `IntegrityHandler` application, focusing on its core components: directory definitions, main application logic, and filesystem encryption utilities. The changes span from November 21, 2025, to November 25, 2025.

The package comment indicates its purpose is to provide a secure container for keys and common variables.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor, non-functional change was made to the package-level comment for improved clarity, updating it to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined constants remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This file outlines the main logic of the `IntegrityHandler`. It includes functions for verifying the environment (checking root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization). It defines `enableIntegrity` to create necessary directories, resolve the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), set up `fscrypt`, and encrypt target directories. It also includes functions for unlocking encrypted directories (`unlockEncryptedDirs`) and securely retrieving the filesystem key (`getFsKey`). A function `ensureDirectoriesExist` is responsible for creating and cleaning specific paths, and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` logs issues if recovery data is found.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**: No functional changes were observed. This appears to be a metadata update without code modification.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM**: A minor refactoring occurred in the `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function. The explicit `afero.Exists` check for the `RecoveryDirPath` was removed, causing `afero.ReadDir` to be attempted directly, simplifying the flow.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: No functional changes were observed. This also appears to be a metadata update without code modification.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file was introduced, establishing the application's entry point. It sets up logging, parses command-line arguments (specifically a `mount` path), defines specific `ExitCode` values for success, generic failure, incompatible environments, and integrity compromises. The `run` function orchestrates the application flow, including logging the version, handling recovery warnings, initializing the environment, calling `enableIntegrity`, and subsequently `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It leverages an embedded version string and directs application execution based on results, returning appropriate exit codes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error types for various failure conditions during encryption and relocation. It includes `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` configuration. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the outcome of encryption attempts for multiple targets, including success, already encrypted, and various failure categories like relocation, encryption, unlocking, restoring, and recovering. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function iterates to encrypt targets, utilizing `encryptTargetDir` which involves relocating contents, recreating the target directory, encrypting it, and handling recovery in case of failures.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Significant refactoring was applied:
        *   The import of the `common` package was removed. As a result, directory paths like `common.MigrationDirPath` were replaced by hardcoded strings (e.g., `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`).
        *   New specific error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were explicitly defined, providing more granular error identification.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by removing the `FailedToRecover` field, and corresponding logic in `newEncryptionResult`, `Failed()`, and `BuildError()` was updated.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function now includes a `switch` statement for more structured error handling after calling `encryptTargetDir`, and successfully processed temporary migration directories are removed.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function signature changed, removing the `recoveryDir` parameter and adding `tempDir`, implying a shift in how recovery paths are managed or passed to this function.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright & Ownership:** All files consistently include a Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025.
*   **Structured Logging:** The application extensively uses a custom `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) for debugging, informational, warning, and error messages, providing clear operational feedback.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** A strong emphasis on comprehensive error handling is evident through the use of `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` for error wrapping, `errors.Is` for type checking, and `errors.Join` for aggregating multiple errors. Custom error types are progressively introduced.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is widely used for filesystem operations, which promotes testability and flexibility by abstracting file system interactions.
*   **Security Context:** The "Integrity Handler" application heavily deals with secure operations, including references to TPM/vTPM, FEMK (File Encryption Master Key) encryption, and secure memory handling (`vault.SecureContainer`), highlighting a security-critical domain.
*   **Idempotency:** Specific functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly documented as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for resilience and repeatability of operations.
*   **Version Control & Development Flow:** The timestamps for `integrity.go` on November 21st suggest a period of active development with frequent saves or commits, while the later, more distinct timestamp on November 25th for `fscrypt.go` indicates a focused refactoring effort.

        *   `SetupOnMount`: An idempotent function to set up `fscrypt` globally and on a specific mount path.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: Tracks the outcome of encryption attempts for multiple target directories, categorizing them into `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, and various failure modes (`FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRestore`, `FailedToRecover`). It also provides methods to check for failures and build a composite error.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through a list of target directories, checking if they are already encrypted before calling `encryptTargetDir` for actual encryption.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Contains the detailed logic for encrypting a single directory, which involves moving its contents to a temporary location, recreating the directory, encrypting it, and then moving the contents back. It imports `common` for directory paths and `vault` for secure key handling.
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM
        *   **Significant Refinement**: This update introduces explicit package-level error variables `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore`.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated to remove the `FailedToRecover` field and its corresponding error handling.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's logic was modified:
            *   The import for the `common` package was removed.
            *   The `tempDir` path is now hardcoded within `EncryptTargetDirs` (e.g., `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`) instead of using `common.MigrationDirPath`.
            *   `encryptTargetDir`'s signature was changed to accept `tempDir` directly, reflecting the removal of the `common` import.
            *   New error handling `switch` statement was added in `EncryptTargetDirs` to process errors from `encryptTargetDir` and clean up the temporary migration directory on success.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directory paths in `directories.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial commit of the core `integrity.go` logic, including environment verification, encryption enablement, and directory management.

*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial commit of `fscrypt.go`, providing the fscrypt-specific encryption and setup wrappers.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A notable refactor in `fscrypt.go`, introducing explicit error variables, removing the `FailedToRecover` tracking, and critically, decoupling `fscrypt.go` from the `common` package by hardcoding paths for temporary directories.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyrights**: All Go files include the same Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025 copyright notice.
*   **Structured Logging**: The application consistently uses a custom `log` package (from `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) for various debug, info, warning, and error messages, providing clear operational feedback.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Go's error handling patterns are extensively used, including `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` for wrapping errors, and custom error types for specific failure scenarios. The `IntegrityHandler` defines custom exit codes based on error types.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `afero` library is used for filesystem operations, likely to allow for easier testing or adaptation to different storage backends.
*   **Security Focus**: Concepts like `SecureContainer` for key management, explicit wiping of plain keys from memory, and reliance on TPM for FEMK encryption highlight a strong focus on security.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are designed and commented to be idempotent, ensuring repeated calls don't lead to unintended side effects.
*   **Directory Management**: There's a clear emphasis on managing specific directories for integrity functions, migration data, recovery data, and manifest files, defined centrally in `common/directories.go` and used throughout the application.
*   **Dependency Management**: The `fscrypt.go` change on 11/25/2025 shows a refactoring to reduce direct dependencies within specific packages, opting for internal constants or parameters instead of importing shared `common` package values for certain paths.

## 4:26:47 AM
The provided code changes pertain to the "Integrity Handler" application, primarily written in Go, which focuses on ensuring system integrity through filesystem encryption. The changes span three main files: `common/directories.go`, `integrity.go`, `main.go`, and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp (First Entry):** 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM
    *   This file defines global constants for key directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `/boot/integrity` (BootDirPath), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (EncryptedKeyPath), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (MigrationDirPath), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (RecoveryDirPath), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (ManifestDirPath). These paths are crucial for the application's operation, especially regarding key storage and data migration/recovery.
    *   **Timestamp (Second Entry):** 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM
    *   A minor update occurred where the package comment was changed from describing the package as containing a "secure container to hold our key" to simply "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined constants remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM
    *   This is a central file implementing the core logic of the Integrity Handler. It includes functions for:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks crucial system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`'s `CheckSupport`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: An idempotent function that ensures necessary directories exist, creates/resolves the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), sets up `fscrypt` on the target mount, and encrypts specified directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks previously encrypted directories. This function handles `errIntegrityCompromised` errors if unlocking fails.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading mechanism to retrieve the filesystem key from a `vault.SecureContainer` after decrypting the FEMK. The original plain key is securely wiped after use.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates all required application directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) with appropriate permissions, and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if data is found in the recovery directory, indicating potential manual intervention is needed.
    *   Despite being logged four times, the content of this file remained identical across all entries on 11/21/2025. This suggests multiple saves without functional changes during a specific development period.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM
    *   This is the application's entry point. It defines custom `ExitCode` constants (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with systemd service return codes.
    *   It embeds the application version using `//go:embed integrity-handler.version`.
    *   The `main` function parses a `mountPath` argument, sets up logging, and orchestrates the integrity process by calling `run()`.
    *   The `run` function coordinates the `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs` steps, ensuring appropriate error handling and exit codes based on the outcome. It also indicates a `TODO` for processing manifests.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp (First Entry):** 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM
    *   This package provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous specific error types for various `fscrypt`-related failures.
    *   It contains `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` configuration.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the status of encryption attempts for multiple target directories (success, already encrypted, failed to relocate, failed to encrypt, failed to unlock, failed to restore, failed to recover).
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` orchestrates the encryption of multiple directories, first relocating contents, then recreating and encrypting the directory, and finally restoring the contents. The `encryptTargetDir` function implements this process, using `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath`.
    *   **Timestamp (Second Entry):** 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM
    *   This update introduces significant refactoring to the `fscrypt` logic:
        *   The `common` package import was removed, indicating a move towards decoupling. Consequently, paths like `common.MigrationDirPath` are replaced by a hardcoded `tempDir` path within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   New explicit error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated methods (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`) were simplified by removing the `FailedToRecover` field and its corresponding logic.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function gained a `switch` statement to handle specific error types returned by `encryptTargetDir`, allowing for more granular error logging.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function itself was modified to accept `tempDir` as a parameter and removed the internal handling and calculation of a `recoveryDir`, simplifying its internal recovery mechanism and shifting responsibility for broader recovery orchestration to the calling `EncryptTargetDirs` function. This suggests a more centralized or revised recovery strategy.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial definition of common directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM:** Active development and saving of the core `integrity.go` logic without functional changes.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** Introduction of the `main.go` entry point, defining the application's overall workflow and error handling.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** A minor update to a package comment in `common/directories.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** Initial implementation of the `fscrypt` wrapper logic, including directory encryption and content migration.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** A substantial refactoring of the `fscrypt` package, streamlining error handling, simplifying the `EncryptionResult` structure, and modifying the recovery strategy within the encryption process. This represents a significant evolution in the `fscrypt` integration.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright Notice:** All Go files consistently include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Error Handling:** A strong pattern of explicit error handling is present, with custom error types and detailed error messages, often using `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...) ` for error wrapping. The `fscrypt.go` file shows an evolution towards more specific error constants and structured error handling.
*   **Logging:** The `log` package (presumably `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) is extensively used for debug, info, warn, and error messages throughout the application, indicating a robust logging strategy.
*   **Filesystem Operations:** The `afero` library (`github.com/spf13/afero`) is used for abstracting filesystem operations, allowing for easier testing and potentially different backend storage.
*   **Security Focus:** The codebase frequently mentions security aspects, such as using a "secure container" for keys, "mlocked" memory, TPM initialization for FEMK encryption, and explicitly wiping sensitive key data. The concept of "integrity compromised" is a central error state.
*   **Idempotence:** The `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` functions are explicitly stated to be idempotent, which is a crucial design principle for reliable system operations.
*   **Directory Management:** Specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are consistently defined and managed for the application's internal data, migration staging, and recovery purposes.

## 5:26:51 AM
The provided log details changes across the `IntegrityHandler` Go application, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity verification.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially defined, establishing key constant paths for the Integrity Handler. These include `BootDirPath`, `EncryptedKeyPath`, `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`. The package comment at this time mentioned a secure container for keys using mmap'ed and mlocked memory.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update to the package comment changed it from a detailed description of secure key handling to a more general statement: "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constant definitions themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM**: The content of this file remained identical across these multiple timestamps, suggesting no functional code changes were introduced in these specific commits.
    *   This file represents the core logic of the Integrity Handler. It includes functions for:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements such as root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: The main function to enable integrity, which ensures necessary directories exist, creates/resolves the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), sets up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypts target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Responsible for unlocking previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function to retrieve the filesystem key, decrypting the FEMK and storing it in a `vault.SecureContainer`, ensuring the plain key is wiped afterward for security.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and optionally cleans up various integrity-related directories with specific permissions.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if data is found in recovery directories, indicating a need for manual intervention.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file was introduced as the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application.
    *   It defines custom `ExitCode` values that align with `systemd` service return codes for success, generic failure, incompatible environment, and integrity compromise.
    *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mountPath` command-line flag, and calls the `run` function.
    *   The `run` function orchestrates the application's flow, including version logging, handling recovery warnings, environment verification, enabling integrity, and unlocking directories, with detailed error handling to return appropriate `ExitCode`s.
    *   It also uses `//go:embed` to embed version information.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation providing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines numerous error constants related to fscrypt operations (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrDestinationNotEmpty`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`).
        *   Includes `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific fscrypt configuration.
        *   Introduces the `EncryptionResult` struct to track the detailed outcomes of encryption attempts, including `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, and various failure types like `FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRestore`, and `FailedToRecover`.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions implement the core encryption logic, involving relocating files, recreating directories, encrypting, and restoring contents. This version explicitly imported and used constants from the `common` package (`common.MigrationDirPath`, `common.RecoveryDirPath`).
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This update introduced significant refactoring:
        *   The import of `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` was **removed**.
        *   New explicit error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added, providing more specific error messages.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was modified by **removing** the `FailedToRecover` field, and corresponding logic in `newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, and `BuildError` functions was updated.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's internal logic was updated: it no longer passed `recoveryDir` to `encryptTargetDir`. The `tempDir` path was hardcoded within `EncryptTargetDirs` instead of relying on the `common` package. Error handling for `encryptTargetDir` became a `switch` statement for specific error types, and successful encryption now explicitly removes the temporary migration directory.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature changed to accept `tempDir` as a parameter and now **returns an `error`** instead of directly appending to the `EncryptionResult` struct. The logic for managing recovery directories (`migrateToRecoveryDir` calls) was also removed from this function.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice**: All Go source files consistently include `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Internal Package Structure**: Consistent use of `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/` as a base for internal imports (e.g., `common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`).
*   **Error Handling Paradigm**: Extensive use of Go's `errors` package (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`, `errors.Is`) for creating, wrapping, and checking errors across the application. Many custom error constants are defined for specific failure conditions.
*   **Logging**: The application uniformly uses `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` for reporting debug, informational, warning, and error messages, aiding in operational visibility.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used for filesystem operations, providing a consistent and testable interface.
*   **Security Emphasis**: Recurring themes include the secure handling of encryption keys (FEMK), TPM integration for key protection, and mentions of secure containers and mlocked memory, underscoring a focus on robust security.
*   **Idempotency**: Several critical functions, such as `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly designed and commented as idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.
*   **Directory Management**: A common pattern is the creation, management, and cleanup of specific directories for integrity operations (e.g., `/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`).
*   **Refactoring Trend**: The most notable pattern of change is the refactoring in `fscrypt.go` at the later timestamp, moving away from relying on global constants from the `common` package for paths and streamlining error handling and recovery logic, indicating an evolution towards more encapsulated and self-contained module behavior.

## 6:26:51 AM
This log details code changes for an Integrity Handler application, written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption and system integrity.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially created to define common directory paths used by the Integrity Handler. Key paths include `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and the encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for failure recovery), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files).
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update occurred, changing the package-level comment from describing the secure container for keys to a more general statement that it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined constants remain unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This file introduced the core application logic. It includes functions to `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` by checking for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support, and TPM initialization. It defines `enableIntegrity` to set up required directories, manage the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK) using a `vault.SecureContainer`, configure `fscrypt`, and encrypt target directories. `unlockEncryptedDirs` handles unlocking, and `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates the necessary directory structure with specific permissions. A `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was included to log issues if recovery data is found.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**, **2:28:49 PM**, **2:40:35 PM**: These timestamps show no material code changes to the file; the content is identical to the initial 2:27:15 PM entry.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point. It sets up logging, defines custom `ExitCode` constants (aligning with systemd values for success, failure, incompatibility, and compromise), and parses a `mount` path argument. The `run` function orchestrates the main workflow: logging the version, handling recovery warnings, initializing the environment, enabling integrity, and unlocking encrypted directories. It includes robust error handling to return specific exit codes based on the type of failure.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file implemented high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined various specific error types related to encryption failures. Key functions include `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup, and `EncryptTargetDirs`. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function, using the `encryptTargetDir` helper, handles the process of encrypting individual directories: relocating their contents to a temporary directory (using `common.MigrationDirPath`), recreating and encrypting the original target, and then moving the contents back. It tracks the status of each target (success, already encrypted, or various failure types) within an `EncryptionResult` struct, and includes recovery mechanisms to move contents to a `recoveryDir` in case of certain failures.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A significant refactoring occurred:
        *   The dependency on the `common` package was removed (`import "github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common"`).
        *   Consequently, references to `common.MigrationDirPath` were replaced with a hardcoded path (`"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`).
        *   New dedicated error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were explicitly defined.
        *   The `FailedToRecover` field and its associated logic were removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its methods, simplifying failure tracking.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions were updated to reflect these changes, including a modified `encryptTargetDir` signature (adding a `tempDir` parameter) and streamlined error handling using a `switch` statement for specific failure types. The previous recovery logic within `encryptTargetDir` was also removed or adjusted.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directory paths in `directories.go`.

*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of `fscrypt` wrappers and detailed encryption logic in `fscrypt.go`.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, decoupling it from the `common` package for directory paths, refining error handling, and simplifying recovery logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Copyright**: All Go files include the copyright `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Security and Integrity Focus**: The codebase is consistently centered around ensuring system integrity, using filesystem encryption (`fscrypt`), a Trusted Platform Module (`tpm`), and secure key management (`vault.SecureContainer`).
*   **Robust Error Handling**: Errors are handled systematically using Go's `errors` package, including wrapping errors with `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, checking with `errors.Is`, and joining errors with `errors.Join`. Specific custom error types are defined for various failure conditions.
*   **Detailed Logging**: `log` package is used extensively at various levels (Debug, Info, Warnf, Errorf) for tracing execution flow, reporting status, and identifying issues.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `afero` library is utilized for filesystem operations, indicating a design choice for flexibility and testability.
*   **Environmental Prerequisites**: The application consistently checks for root privileges and a minimum kernel version (5.4) as essential requirements for its operation.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects.
*   **Migration and Recovery**: A consistent pattern involves temporary relocation of data to migration directories during encryption and provision for recovery directories in case of failures, though the specific implementation details for recovery were refactored in `fscrypt.go`.

## 7:26:48 AM
The initial log entry at **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM** for `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go` defines key constant paths for the Integrity Handler application. These include `BootDirPath` (`/boot/integrity`), `EncryptedKeyPath` (`/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key), `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath` all within `/opt/128technology/integrity/`.

Shortly after, at **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**, the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go` was introduced. This extensive file implements the core logic for the Integrity Handler. Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, which checks system requirements like running as root, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, and TPM initialization. The `enableIntegrity` function handles ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving/decrypting the FEMK, setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories. A `getFsKey` function is responsible for lazy-loading the filesystem key into a `vault.SecureContainer` after decryption and securely wiping the plaintext key. Directory management, including creating and cleaning migration/recovery paths, is handled by `ensureDirectoriesExist`, while `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` logs issues if recovery data is found. Subsequent log entries for `integrity.go` at **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**, **2:28:49 PM**, and **2:40:35 PM** show identical code content, indicating no functional changes were made to this file during these specific timestamps.

At **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go` was updated, establishing the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants for various application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) and handles argument parsing for the mount path. The `run` function orchestrates the Integrity Handler's lifecycle, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, and mapping errors to appropriate exit codes.

A minor update occurred at **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM** in `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`. The package comment was clarified from a detailed description of key container mechanisms to a simpler "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constant directory paths remained unchanged.

The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go` received its initial logged content at **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**. This file implements high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` functionalities. It defines numerous error types related to encryption and directory operations, a `protectorName` constant set to "FEMK", and the `SetupOnMount` function for global and filesystem `fscrypt` setup. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the status of encryption attempts, including various success and failure categories. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function orchestrates the encryption of target directories, using `encryptTargetDir` to move contents out, create an empty encrypted directory, and then move contents back.

A significant update to `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go` followed at **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**. This change involved adding new specific error constants like `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore`. The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by removing the `FailedToRecover` field, and corresponding methods (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`) were updated. Crucially, the `EncryptTargetDirs` function was refactored to remove its direct import of the `common` package. Instead, temporary and recovery directory paths are now managed as local variables or parameters, and error handling for the `encryptTargetDir` call was streamlined using a `switch` statement, which also includes logic to clean up temporary directories on success. The `encryptTargetDir` function was also modified to align with these changes, no longer directly referencing `common` package paths for temporary directories and removing the `migrateToRecoveryDir` logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice:** All files consistently include `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` at the top.
*   **Integrity Handler Focus:** The entire codebase revolves around an "Integrity Handler" application, emphasizing filesystem encryption via `fscrypt`, TPM integration, and secure key management using a `vault` package.
*   **Detailed Error Handling:** There is a consistent pattern of comprehensive error handling using standard Go practices (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`, `errors.Is`) to provide specific and actionable error messages, particularly in `integrity.go` and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`.
*   **Directory Management:** A recurring theme is the programmatic creation, cleaning, and management of specific application-related directories within `/boot` and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` using `afero.Fs` for abstract filesystem operations.
*   **Idempotency:** Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be called multiple times without causing different results beyond the first execution.
*   **Secure Key Handling Abstraction:** The code references a `vault.SecureContainer` for key management and processes like decrypting a "FEMK" (File Encryption Master Key) and wiping plaintext keys from memory, demonstrating a focus on security by design without exposing sensitive key content.
*   **Timestamp Pattern for `integrity.go`:** Multiple entries for `integrity.go` on `11/21/2025` with identical code suggest repeated saves or non-functional updates in the commit history.

## 8:26:47 AM
The provided log details changes across several Go source files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focusing on filesystem encryption, TPM integration, and secure directory management.

**File-specific updates:**

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was introduced to define constant paths for various directories crucial to the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` (for handler files), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted FEMK path), and directories for migration data, recovery, and integrity manifests under `/opt/128technology/integrity/`.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update occurred, changing the package-level comment to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler" from a more detailed description about a secure container. The defined directory paths remained unchanged.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** (with subsequent identical timestamps at 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM): This file contains the core logic of the Integrity Handler. Key functions include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Performs system checks, ensuring the application runs as root, on a compatible kernel version (>= 5.4), with filesystem encryption support, and that `fscrypt` is installed and TPM is initialized.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Manages the process of ensuring necessary directories exist, handling the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount point, and initiating the encryption of target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Facilitates unlocking directories that have been encrypted.
        *   `getFsKey`: Responsible for securely loading the filesystem key from the decrypted FEMK and securely wiping the original key.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates all required directories with appropriate permissions and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for and logs warnings if contents are found in the recovery directory, indicating a need for manual intervention.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file serves as the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines specific `ExitCode` constants (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) to provide granular exit statuses. The `main` function initializes logging, parses a mount path, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the overall flow, including version reporting, environment verification, directory recovery warnings, enabling integrity, and unlocking encrypted directories, with comprehensive error handling to return specific exit codes.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file introduced the `fscrypt` specific wrapper functions. It defines various error types related to `fscrypt` operations (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`) and sets a `protectorName` constant to "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Handles the global and filesystem-specific setup of `fscrypt`.
        *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct to detail the outcome of encryption attempts, categorizing successes, already encrypted directories, and different types of failures.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Orchestrates the encryption of multiple target directories, leveraging `encryptTargetDir` for individual directory processing.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Implements the steps to encrypt a single directory: relocating its contents to a temporary migration directory (using `common.MigrationDirPath`), recreating the target directory as empty, encrypting it, and noted steps for restoring content or moving to a recovery directory (using `common.RecoveryDirPath`).
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This entry shows a significant refactoring:
        *   The import of the `common` package was removed from this file.
        *   New, more specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was updated, specifically removing the `FailedToRecover` field and adjusting its related `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods.
        *   In `EncryptTargetDirs`, the `tempDir` path now uses a hardcoded string `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"` instead of the `common.MigrationDirPath` constant, directly reflecting the removal of the `common` import. Error handling after `encryptTargetDir` was improved with a `switch` statement to categorize failures, and a successful encryption now explicitly triggers cleanup of the temporary directory.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function no longer explicitly manages a `recoveryDir` variable or calls a `migrateToRecoveryDir` function in the visible snippet, implying a change or relocation of that specific recovery logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notices**: All files consistently include the "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." header.
*   **Logging**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is extensively used across all files for debugging, informational messages, warnings, and error reporting.
*   **Error Handling**: Go's standard error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`) and error type checking (`errors.Is`) are frequently employed for robust error management.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used for filesystem operations, suggesting an architectural choice for easier testing and mocking of file system interactions.
*   **Focus on Integrity and Encryption**: The code base is centered around ensuring system integrity through filesystem encryption, utilizing `fscrypt` and TPM functionality, with detailed mechanisms for setup, key management, and recovery.
*   **Idempotency**: Explicit comments highlight the intent for functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` to be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without unintended side effects.
