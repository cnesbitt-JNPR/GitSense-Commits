# Activity Summary for 12/1/2025

## 12:26:49 AM
The changes log details the development of a Go application named "Integrity Handler," primarily focused on filesystem encryption and integrity management.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** This file was initially introduced, defining key constant paths for the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` for core files and the encrypted key (`femk.enc`), and `/opt/128technology/integrity` for migration data (`.migration-store`), recovery (`migration-recovery`), and manifest files (`manifest.d`).
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** A minor update occurred, changing the package comment from a detailed description of key storage to a general statement about common globals, with no functional code changes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** The core logic of the Integrity Handler was implemented. This includes functions for:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt/metadata`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process by ensuring directories exist, resolving a Front-End Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Securely loads the filesystem key from an encrypted FEMK.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates necessary directories with specific permissions (e.g., `0o750`, `0o700` for `/boot/integrity`) and cleans the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if contents are found in the recovery directory.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM:** Multiple entries for this file show no functional code changes but indicate re-saves or minor non-code modifications over a short period.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** This file was introduced as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`), embeds a version string, parses a `--mount` flag, and orchestrates the call to `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes logic to handle specific error conditions and return appropriate exit codes, notably `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** This file was introduced, implementing wrappers around `fscrypt` operations. It defines various error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), a `protectorName` ("FEMK"), and functions like `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem `fscrypt` configuration. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks detailed outcomes of encryption operations. The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions implement the core logic for encrypting directories, involving temporary relocation of contents, recreation of empty directories, encryption, and restoration. It relies on constants from the `common` package.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** A significant refactoring was applied. Key changes include:
        *   **Removal of `common` package import:** This led to hardcoding the `tempDir` path within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   **Introduction of specific error types:** `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were explicitly defined, enhancing error granularity.
        *   **Simplification of `EncryptionResult`:** The `FailedToRecover` field was removed, and related logic in `Failed()` and `BuildError()` was updated.
        *   **Refined error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs`:** A `switch` statement was added to explicitly handle different types of failures from `encryptTargetDir` and log messages, along with cleaning up the temporary migration directory on success.
        *   **Modified `encryptTargetDir` signature and internal logic:** The `recoveryDir` parameter was removed, and associated recovery logic within the function was adjusted.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial creation of `common/directories.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** Initial implementation of the main integrity logic in `integrity.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** Introduction of `main.go`, establishing the application's entry point and overall flow.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** Initial implementation of the `fscrypt` wrapper logic in `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** Major refactoring of `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, significantly impacting its error handling, dependency management (removal of `common` import), and recovery mechanisms. This occurred several days after the initial development burst.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright Header:** All Go files consistently include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`.
*   **Integrity Handler Focus:** The entire codebase revolves around an "Integrity Handler" application designed to secure the system, primarily through filesystem encryption managed by `fscrypt` and key management with TPM/vault.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code uses `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, and `errors.Join` extensively to create explicit, chained, and comprehensive error messages. Specific `ExitCode` values are defined for different failure scenarios.
*   **`afero` Filesystem Abstraction:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used across `integrity.go` and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` for abstracting filesystem operations, suggesting a design that allows for easier testing or different storage backends.
*   **`fscrypt` Integration:** Deep integration with `github.com/google/fscrypt` is central, involving environment checks, setup, and directory encryption/unlocking.
*   **Key Management:** The concept of a "FEMK" (Filesystem Encryption Master Key) and its secure handling via `tpm` and `vault` packages (e.g., `vault.SecureContainer`) is a recurring theme, emphasizing security.
*   **Directory Structure:** A consistent set of specialized directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `migration-recovery`, `manifest.d`) is used for the application's operations, including temporary data, recovery, and configuration.
*   **Idempotency Requirement:** Both `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly marked as needing to be idempotent, which is crucial for reliability in system management applications.
*   **`log` package usage:** A custom `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is used throughout for consistent logging.
*   **TODO Comments:** The presence of `TODO` comments indicates ongoing development and areas for future enhancement, such as "best effort shred," manifest processing, and `path` plumbing for upgrades.

## 1:26:46 AM
The provided code logs detail the development of an "Integrity Handler" Go application, primarily focused on secure filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM/vTPM integration. The changes span several core files, revealing updates to directory management, environmental checks, and the encryption process itself.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**
        This file initializes constant strings for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and the encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data post-migration failure), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for integrity manifests). The package comment mentions using a secure container based on mmap'ed and mlocked memory for keys.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**
        A minor documentation update occurred in this commit. The package comment was simplified from detailing the secure container to a more general `Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler.`. The directory constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM**
        Across these timestamps, the content of `integrity.go` appears to be identical. This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler application. It defines an `errIntegrityCompromised` error and several key functions:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like being run as root, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata`), the presence of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM/vTPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process by ensuring necessary directories exist, creating/resolving the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and initiating the encryption of target directories. It is designed to be idempotent.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories, flagging integrity compromises on failure.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function that decrypts the FEMK from disk, stores the plaintext key in a `vault.SecureContainer` (a secure memory container), and then wipes the original plaintext key from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates all required Integrity Handler directories with specific permissions and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if data is found in the recovery directory, suggesting manual intervention is needed.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**
        This file serves as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants to standardize process return values (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`). It embeds the application version and parses a `mount` path argument. The `run` function orchestrates the application's lifecycle: logging, initializing application state, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity for default targets, and finally unlocking any already encrypted directories. Error handling is structured to return specific exit codes based on the type of failure.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**
        This file provides high-level Go wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous specific error constants for various fscrypt-related failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`). The `SetupOnMount` function performs global and filesystem-specific fscrypt setup. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the outcome of encrypting multiple directories, including successes, already encrypted paths, and various failure types. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function iterates through target directories, initiating the `encryptTargetDir` process, which involves moving contents out, recreating the directory, encrypting it, and then moving contents back. Error handling includes relocating failed items to a recovery directory.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**
        This timestamp introduces significant refactoring within the `fscrypt.go` file:
        *   **Error Management Refinement**: New dedicated error constants `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore` were added, replacing more generic failure handling. Concurrently, the `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its related methods (`Failed()`, `BuildError()`). This indicates a shift in how specific recovery-related failures are tracked or reported.
        *   **Decoupling from `common`**: The import of the `common` package was removed. This means directory paths like `common.MigrationDirPath` are no longer directly referenced from within `fscrypt.go`. Instead, the `tempDir` path within `EncryptTargetDirs` is now hardcoded.
        *   **Revised Encryption Workflow**: The `encryptTargetDir` function no longer handles the creation of a `recoveryDir` or the migration of contents to it directly. Instead, `encryptTargetDir` now returns an error to its caller (`EncryptTargetDirs`). The `EncryptTargetDirs` function now uses a `switch` statement to categorize and log these returned errors more precisely. If `encryptTargetDir` is successful, `EncryptTargetDirs` explicitly removes the temporary migration directory.
        *   **Permission Handling Simplification**: The `encryptTargetDir` function was simplified by no longer attempting to `fs.Stat(target)` to capture existing directory permissions before recreation. It now defaults to a fixed `os.FileMode(0o0750)`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright (2025):** All files consistently feature the `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` notice.
*   **Integrity Handler Focus:** The application's purpose, "Integrity Handler," is prominent across file comments and functionality.
*   **Secure Key Management:** There is a clear emphasis on managing a File Encryption Master Key (FEMK) securely, utilizing a `vault.SecureContainer` and TPM/vTPM.
*   **Filesystem Encryption (fscrypt):** The `github.com/google/fscrypt` library is central to the encryption logic, along with extensive error handling for various fscrypt-related operations.
*   **Structured Error Handling:** The codebase makes heavy use of Go's `errors` package, including `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf` with wrapping (`%w`), `errors.Is`, and `errors.Join`, for comprehensive error reporting and classification.
*   **Abstracted Filesystem Operations:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used to abstract filesystem interactions, enabling easier testing and potentially different underlying filesystem implementations.
*   **Logging:** Consistent use of a `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) with different severity levels (Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Errorf).
*   **Directory Standardization:** A set of specific directory paths for boot, encryption keys, migration, recovery, and manifests are defined and consistently used.
*   **Idempotency Requirement:** Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed and documented to be idempotent.
*   **System Environment Requirements:** The application enforces strict environmental checks, including requiring root privileges and a minimum kernel version, along with filesystem encryption support.
