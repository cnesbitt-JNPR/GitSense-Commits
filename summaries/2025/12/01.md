# Activity Summary for 12/1/2025

## 12:26:49 AM
The changes log details the development of a Go application named "Integrity Handler," primarily focused on filesystem encryption and integrity management.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** This file was initially introduced, defining key constant paths for the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` for core files and the encrypted key (`femk.enc`), and `/opt/128technology/integrity` for migration data (`.migration-store`), recovery (`migration-recovery`), and manifest files (`manifest.d`).
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** A minor update occurred, changing the package comment from a detailed description of key storage to a general statement about common globals, with no functional code changes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** The core logic of the Integrity Handler was implemented. This includes functions for:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt/metadata`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process by ensuring directories exist, resolving a Front-End Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Securely loads the filesystem key from an encrypted FEMK.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates necessary directories with specific permissions (e.g., `0o750`, `0o700` for `/boot/integrity`) and cleans the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if contents are found in the recovery directory.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM:** Multiple entries for this file show no functional code changes but indicate re-saves or minor non-code modifications over a short period.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** This file was introduced as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`), embeds a version string, parses a `--mount` flag, and orchestrates the call to `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes logic to handle specific error conditions and return appropriate exit codes, notably `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** This file was introduced, implementing wrappers around `fscrypt` operations. It defines various error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), a `protectorName` ("FEMK"), and functions like `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem `fscrypt` configuration. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks detailed outcomes of encryption operations. The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions implement the core logic for encrypting directories, involving temporary relocation of contents, recreation of empty directories, encryption, and restoration. It relies on constants from the `common` package.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** A significant refactoring was applied. Key changes include:
        *   **Removal of `common` package import:** This led to hardcoding the `tempDir` path within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   **Introduction of specific error types:** `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were explicitly defined, enhancing error granularity.
        *   **Simplification of `EncryptionResult`:** The `FailedToRecover` field was removed, and related logic in `Failed()` and `BuildError()` was updated.
        *   **Refined error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs`:** A `switch` statement was added to explicitly handle different types of failures from `encryptTargetDir` and log messages, along with cleaning up the temporary migration directory on success.
        *   **Modified `encryptTargetDir` signature and internal logic:** The `recoveryDir` parameter was removed, and associated recovery logic within the function was adjusted.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial creation of `common/directories.go`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright Header:** All Go files consistently include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`.
*   **Integrity Handler Focus:** The entire codebase revolves around an "Integrity Handler" application designed to secure the system, primarily through filesystem encryption managed by `fscrypt` and key management with TPM/vault.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code uses `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, and `errors.Join` extensively to create explicit, chained, and comprehensive error messages. Specific `ExitCode` values are defined for different failure scenarios.
*   **`afero` Filesystem Abstraction:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used across `integrity.go` and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` for abstracting filesystem operations, suggesting a design that allows for easier testing or different storage backends.
*   **`fscrypt` Integration:** Deep integration with `github.com/google/fscrypt` is central, involving environment checks, setup, and directory encryption/unlocking.
*   **Key Management:** The concept of a "FEMK" (Filesystem Encryption Master Key) and its secure handling via `tpm` and `vault` packages (e.g., `vault.SecureContainer`) is a recurring theme, emphasizing security.
*   **Directory Structure:** A consistent set of specialized directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `migration-recovery`, `manifest.d`) is used for the application's operations, including temporary data, recovery, and configuration.
*   **Idempotency Requirement:** Both `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly marked as needing to be idempotent, which is crucial for reliability in system management applications.
*   **`log` package usage:** A custom `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is used throughout for consistent logging.
*   **TODO Comments:** The presence of `TODO` comments indicates ongoing development and areas for future enhancement, such as "best effort shred," manifest processing, and `path` plumbing for upgrades.

## 1:26:46 AM
The provided code logs detail the development of an "Integrity Handler" Go application, primarily focused on secure filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM/vTPM integration. The changes span several core files, revealing updates to directory management, environmental checks, and the encryption process itself.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**
        This file initializes constant strings for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and the encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data post-migration failure), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for integrity manifests). The package comment mentions using a secure container based on mmap'ed and mlocked memory for keys.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**
        A minor documentation update occurred in this commit. The package comment was simplified from detailing the secure container to a more general `Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler.`. The directory constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM**
        Across these timestamps, the content of `integrity.go` appears to be identical. This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler application. It defines an `errIntegrityCompromised` error and several key functions:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like being run as root, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata`), the presence of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM/vTPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process by ensuring necessary directories exist, creating/resolving the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and initiating the encryption of target directories. It is designed to be idempotent.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories, flagging integrity compromises on failure.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function that decrypts the FEMK from disk, stores the plaintext key in a `vault.SecureContainer` (a secure memory container), and then wipes the original plaintext key from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates all required Integrity Handler directories with specific permissions and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if data is found in the recovery directory, suggesting manual intervention is needed.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**
        This file serves as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants to standardize process return values (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`). It embeds the application version and parses a `mount` path argument. The `run` function orchestrates the application's lifecycle: logging, initializing application state, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity for default targets, and finally unlocking any already encrypted directories. Error handling is structured to return specific exit codes based on the type of failure.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**
        This file provides high-level Go wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous specific error constants for various fscrypt-related failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`). The `SetupOnMount` function performs global and filesystem-specific fscrypt setup. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the outcome of encrypting multiple directories, including successes, already encrypted paths, and various failure types. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function iterates through target directories, initiating the `encryptTargetDir` process, which involves moving contents out, recreating the directory, encrypting it, and then moving contents back. Error handling includes relocating failed items to a recovery directory.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**
        This timestamp introduces significant refactoring within the `fscrypt.go` file:
        *   **Error Management Refinement**: New dedicated error constants `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore` were added, replacing more generic failure handling. Concurrently, the `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its related methods (`Failed()`, `BuildError()`). This indicates a shift in how specific recovery-related failures are tracked or reported.
        *   **Decoupling from `common`**: The import of the `common` package was removed. This means directory paths like `common.MigrationDirPath` are no longer directly referenced from within `fscrypt.go`. Instead, the `tempDir` path within `EncryptTargetDirs` is now hardcoded.
        *   **Revised Encryption Workflow**: The `encryptTargetDir` function no longer handles the creation of a `recoveryDir` or the migration of contents to it directly. Instead, `encryptTargetDir` now returns an error to its caller (`EncryptTargetDirs`). The `EncryptTargetDirs` function now uses a `switch` statement to categorize and log these returned errors more precisely. If `encryptTargetDir` is successful, `EncryptTargetDirs` explicitly removes the temporary migration directory.
        *   **Permission Handling Simplification**: The `encryptTargetDir` function was simplified by no longer attempting to `fs.Stat(target)` to capture existing directory permissions before recreation. It now defaults to a fixed `os.FileMode(0o0750)`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright (2025):** All files consistently feature the `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` notice.
*   **Integrity Handler Focus:** The application's purpose, "Integrity Handler," is prominent across file comments and functionality.
*   **Secure Key Management:** There is a clear emphasis on managing a File Encryption Master Key (FEMK) securely, utilizing a `vault.SecureContainer` and TPM/vTPM.
*   **Filesystem Encryption (fscrypt):** The `github.com/google/fscrypt` library is central to the encryption logic, along with extensive error handling for various fscrypt-related operations.
*   **Structured Error Handling:** The codebase makes heavy use of Go's `errors` package, including `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf` with wrapping (`%w`), `errors.Is`, and `errors.Join`, for comprehensive error reporting and classification.
*   **Abstracted Filesystem Operations:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used to abstract filesystem interactions, enabling easier testing and potentially different underlying filesystem implementations.
*   **Logging:** Consistent use of a `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) with different severity levels (Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Errorf).
*   **Directory Standardization:** A set of specific directory paths for boot, encryption keys, migration, recovery, and manifests are defined and consistently used.
*   **Idempotency Requirement:** Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed and documented to be idempotent.
*   **System Environment Requirements:** The application enforces strict environmental checks, including requiring root privileges and a minimum kernel version, along with filesystem encryption support.

## 2:26:55 AM
The provided log details code changes for an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption, secure key management, and system integrity. The changes span two key dates: November 21, 2025, for initial setup and main logic, and November 25, 2025, for a significant refactor in the `fscrypt` module.

    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This substantial file, representing the core logic of the Integrity Handler, was initially committed. It includes:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: A function to check system prerequisites such as root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: The main function to set up and enable integrity, involving directory creation, File Encryption Master Key (FEMK) handling, `fscrypt` setup, and encrypting target directories. It's explicitly noted as needing to be idempotent.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: A function to unlock encrypted directories, treating most failures as integrity violations.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading mechanism for the filesystem key, stored in a `vault.SecureContainer`.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: A utility function to create and clean the various directories defined in `common/directories.go`.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: A function to log warnings if any contents are found in the recovery directory.
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: Multiple subsequent entries for this file on the same day show no visible code changes in the provided log snippets, suggesting these were likely minor formatting adjustments, comment updates not captured in the diff, or repeated log entries.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point. Key features include:
        *   Definition of `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with systemd service return codes.
        *   Integration of `go:embed` for versioning.
        *   A `main` function that parses command-line arguments (specifically a `mountPath`), sets logging, and calls the primary `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the initialization, environment verification, integrity enabling, and directory unlocking processes, mapping any errors to appropriate `ExitCode`s. It contains `TODO`s regarding manifest processing.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file initially provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines specific error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), a `protectorName` constant ("FEMK"), and the `SetupOnMount` function for global `fscrypt` configuration. It introduces the `EncryptionResult` struct to track encryption outcomes and the `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions for the core encryption logic, including relocating files and encrypting directories. At this stage, `encryptTargetDir` explicitly uses `common.MigrationDirPath`.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A significant refactoring was applied.
        *   The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` import was removed, indicating a move towards greater encapsulation within the `fscrypt` package.
        *   New, more specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced for clearer error reporting.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by removing the `FailedToRecover` field.
        *   Path handling for temporary directories (`tempDir`) was hardcoded to `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/" + dirName`, replacing the reliance on the removed `common` import.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was refactored to use a `switch` statement for detailed error handling from `encryptTargetDir` and now explicitly attempts to remove temporary directories upon successful encryption. The full internal changes to `encryptTargetDir` are not shown, but the updated call signature and error handling imply a substantial internal rework to return these more granular error types.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Security and Integrity Focus**: The entire codebase is dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" that leverages filesystem encryption (`fscrypt`), Trusted Platform Module (TPM) integration, and secure containers (`vault`) for robust system and data protection.
*   **Go Language Conventions**: Consistent use of Go's error handling patterns (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Is`, `errors.Join`), package structure, and standard library components, alongside external libraries like `afero` for filesystem abstraction.
*   **Copyright**: Every file includes the same copyright notice: "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved."
*   **Directory Management**: A recurring theme is the creation, management, and cleaning of specific directories related to integrity, migration, and recovery, often using `os.FileMode` for permissions.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed or commented to be idempotent, ensuring reliable operation even if executed multiple times.
*   **Timestamps**: Initial development and core logic setup predominantly occurred on 11/21/2025, followed by a substantial functional refactoring in the `fscrypt` module on 11/25/2025, indicating active and iterative development.

## 3:26:50 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go source files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, with timestamps spanning from November 21st to November 25th, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** This file was initially defined, establishing constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler.

    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** A minor change occurred, updating the package-level comment from a more detailed description of a secure container to a simpler "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** The core logic of the Integrity Handler application was introduced. This includes functions for:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt`), the presence of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process by ensuring directories exist, creating/retrieving the FEMK (via `createFEMK` and `getFsKey`), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and initiating directory encryption.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories, treating failures as integrity compromises.
        *   `getFsKey`: Securely loads the filesystem key into a `vault.SecureContainer` after decryption and wipes the plaintext key.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates all necessary application directories with specific permissions (e.g., `0o750` for migration, `0o700` for boot paths) and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if residual content is found in the recovery directory.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**, **11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM**, **11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM:** Multiple entries for this file at these timestamps show no functional changes in the code. These appear to be incidental saves or minor, non-functional edits.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** This file defines the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application. Key aspects include:
        *   Definition of custom `ExitCode` values (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with systemd service return codes.
        *   Use of `go:embed` to include a version string.
        *   Command-line argument parsing for a `mount` path (defaulting to `/`).
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: logging the version, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, calling `enableIntegrity`, and then `unlockEncryptedDirs` for already encrypted paths. It manages error handling and returns appropriate exit codes based on the outcome, specifically returning `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** The initial implementation of the `fscrypt` package was added. This package provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations and includes:
        *   Definitions for various error types related to encryption and filesystem operations.
        *   `SetupOnMount`: A function to perform global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: A detailed structure to track the outcome of encryption attempts, categorizing successes, already encrypted targets, and different types of failures (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, recover).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: The primary function to encrypt target directories, which internally calls `encryptTargetDir` for individual targets.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: This function outlines a complex multi-step process involving moving contents out of a target directory to a temporary location, recreating the target as an empty encrypted directory, and then moving contents back in. It also included logic for moving contents to a recovery directory in case of certain failures.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** A significant refactoring occurred in this file:
        *   The direct import of the `common` package was removed. As a consequence, paths like `MigrationDirPath` are now hardcoded within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   New explicit `var` error definitions (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced, replacing their implicit tracking within `EncryptionResult`. The `FailedToRecover` category was removed from `EncryptionResult` and related error handling.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated with a `switch` statement to handle different error outcomes from `encryptTargetDir` and now explicitly removes temporary migration directories upon success.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function signature changed to accept `tempDir` as an argument, and the internal logic for creating and utilizing a `recoveryDir` during certain failure paths was removed, indicating a shift in recovery strategy to a higher-level handler.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright:** All files consistently include the copyright notice "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved."
*   **Security Focus:** The codebase is fundamentally about system integrity and encryption, utilizing TPM, fscrypt, and secure key containers (`vault`).
*   **Directory Structure:** A consistent set of specific directories under `/boot/integrity` and `/opt/128technology/integrity` is used for application files, encrypted keys, migration, and recovery data.
*   **Idempotency:** Core functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed or intended to be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unintended effects.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** The application demonstrates robust error handling, with custom error types, `errors.Join` for aggregating multiple errors, and specific exit codes (`ExitCode` enum) for `main.go` to provide detailed status information.
*   **Logging:** The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is extensively used throughout, providing debug, info, warning, and error logging capabilities.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The use of `github.com/spf13/afero` indicates a design choice to abstract filesystem operations, making the code potentially more testable or adaptable to different filesystem implementations.

## 4:26:49 AM
**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
*   **Timestamp**: Initial definition at 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM, with a minor update at 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM.
*   **Updates**: This file defines essential constants for directory paths critical to the Integrity Handler. These paths include `/boot/integrity` (for handler files), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for failure recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for integrity manifests). The later update was a minor change to the package comment, clarifying its purpose as containing "common globals."

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
*   **Timestamp**: First observed at 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, with subsequent identical versions until 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM.
*   **Updates**: This file introduces the core functional logic of the Integrity Handler. Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, which performs system checks such as ensuring root privileges, a minimum kernel version (5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`), the presence of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization. It also defines `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, which are central to managing encryption and decryption of target directories. Helper functions like `getFsKey` handle the secure loading and wiping of the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK) using a `vault.SecureContainer`. `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates and manages the various integrity-related directories with specific permissions, including cleaning the migration store. `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` checks for and logs warnings if data is found in the recovery directory, indicating potential issues.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
*   **Timestamp**: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM.
*   **Updates**: This file establishes the main entry point and execution flow of the Integrity Handler application. It defines an `ExitCode` enum with distinct values for success, generic failure, environmental incompatibility, and integrity compromise. The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mountPath` command-line argument, and orchestrates the integrity process via the `run` function. The `run` function performs environment verification, handles recovery directory warnings, calls `enableIntegrity` to encrypt and set up targets, and `unlockEncryptedDirs` for subsequent unlocking. Error handling is structured to return specific exit codes based on the nature of any failures, particularly `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
*   **Timestamp**: Significant changes occurred at 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM, followed by a major refactoring at 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM.
*   **Updates**:
    *   **Initial (11/21)**: Introduced high-level Go wrappers for interacting with the `fscrypt` library. It defined numerous custom error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`) to detail various stages of encryption failures. The `SetupOnMount` function was added to idempotently configure `fscrypt` globally and on a specific mount path. The `EncryptionResult` struct was implemented to track the outcome of encrypting multiple target directories (success, already encrypted, relocation failures, encryption failures, etc.). The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions detailed a multi-step encryption process involving migrating existing directory contents to a temporary location, recreating the target directory as empty, encrypting it, and then restoring the contents. Initial logic for recovery on encryption failure was present.
    *   **Refactoring (11/25)**: This update streamlined the `fscrypt` package. It removed the direct import of the `common` package, instead hardcoding the migration store path (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`). It refined error reporting by adding more specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) and removed the `FailedToRecover` field from the `EncryptionResult` struct, simplifying its structure and the `BuildError` method. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to use a `switch` statement for handling specific `encryptTargetDir` errors and now includes explicit cleanup of the temporary migration directory (`tempDir`) upon successful encryption. The `encryptTargetDir` function was also simplified, removing explicit parameters and calls related to a recovery directory during the encryption process itself.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:
*   **Integrity and Security**: The codebase consistently focuses on data integrity and security, utilizing `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, TPM for key management, and a `SecureContainer` for handling sensitive keys in memory.
*   **Structured Error Handling**: There's a strong pattern of defining custom error types (`errors.New`) and using `errors.Is` and `errors.Join` for detailed, composite error reporting. The `EncryptionResult` struct is a specific example of collecting and summarizing multiple potential failure conditions.
*   **Idempotent Operations**: Functions critical to setup and enablement (`SetupOnMount`, `enableIntegrity`) are designed to be idempotent, allowing them to be safely re-run without causing issues.
*   **Explicit Directory Management**: The code frequently creates, manipulates, and checks specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/...`) with explicit file permissions (e.g., `0o750`, `0o700`), underscoring the importance of controlled file system access.
*   **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All Go files include the `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` header, indicating corporate ownership.
*   **Comprehensive Logging**: Extensive use of `log` package functions (`Debug`, `Info`, `Warnf`, `Errorf`) provides detailed operational tracing and error reporting throughout the application.

## 5:26:48 AM
The logs detail the development and refinement of an Integrity Handler application written in Go, focusing on file encryption and system integrity.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially created, defining critical constant paths for the Integrity Handler. These include `BootDirPath` (`/boot/integrity`), `EncryptedKeyPath` (`/boot/integrity/femk.enc`), `MigrationDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`), `RecoveryDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`), and `ManifestDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`). The package comment highlighted its role in providing common variables and a secure container for keys at runtime.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update occurred, changing the package comment to a more general description: "// Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined directory paths remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** (and subsequent entries at 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM): This file, representing the core logic of the Integrity Handler, was consistently updated or logged without functional changes in the provided snippets. It imports several internal packages (`common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`) and external libraries (`fscrypt`, `afero`, `log`). Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (handling FEMK creation, key retrieval, fscrypt setup, and directory encryption), `unlockEncryptedDirs` (for unlocking encrypted directories), `getFsKey` (for lazy-loading the filesystem key into a secure container), and `ensureDirectoriesExist` (to create necessary migration, recovery, and manifest directories with specific permissions). It also includes `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to check the recovery directory for abandoned items. The `common` package is used extensively here for directory paths.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This new file serves as the entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised), indicating systemd service return code conventions. The `main` function parses a `--mount` path argument, sets up logging, and defers to the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: logging the version, initializing `appState`, handling recovery directory warnings, verifying the environment, and then calling `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` based on a `DefaultManifest`. It includes error handling to distinguish between generic failures, integrity compromises, and environmental incompatibilities.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This initial version provided high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined several error constants related to encryption processes (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), a `protectorName` constant ("FEMK"), and a `SetupOnMount` function for fscrypt initialization. It introduced an `EncryptionResult` struct to detail the outcomes of encryption attempts (success, already encrypted, failed to relocate, failed to encrypt, failed to unlock, failed to restore, failed to recover). The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions implement the core encryption logic, moving files, creating encrypted directories, and restoring contents. This version explicitly imported and used paths from the `common` package (`common.MigrationDirPath`, `common.RecoveryDirPath`).
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A significant refactor was introduced in this update.
        *   The `common` package import was *removed*, indicating a move towards self-containment for directory path definitions within the `fscrypt` package. The `MigrationDirPath` was replaced by a hardcoded string (`"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`) directly within the `EncryptTargetDirs` function.
        *   New, more specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added, providing clearer error descriptions.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by *removing* the `FailedToRecover` field, streamlining the failure tracking. Consequently, the `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated to reflect this change.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function now passes the dynamically created `tempDir` to `encryptTargetDir` and includes a more structured `switch` statement for handling various error types returned by `encryptTargetDir`, including post-success cleanup of the temporary migration directory.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function signature was updated to accept `tempDir`, and the internal logic for handling recovery (specifically `recoveryDir` and `migrateToRecoveryDir` calls) appears to have been refactored or removed from this specific function's scope, aligning with the removal of `FailedToRecover` from `EncryptionResult`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directory paths in `directories.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial core logic of the Integrity Handler in `integrity.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of the `main.go` application entry point.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of `fscrypt` wrapper functions.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, specifically removing direct dependency on the `common` package for paths, refining error handling, and simplifying the `EncryptionResult` struct.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All files consistently include the "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." header.
*   **Focus on System Integrity and Encryption**: The entire codebase revolves around securing directories through `fscrypt` encryption, managing keys (FEMK), and performing environment checks for robust security.
*   **Go Language Conventions**: Adherence to Go's package structure, error handling with `fmt.Errorf` and `errors.Join`, and use of `context.Context` for cancellation/timeout.
*   **Dependency on `afero`**: The `afero` filesystem abstraction library is consistently used for file system operations, allowing for easier testing and potentially different underlying file systems.
*   **TPM Integration**: The `tpm.InitializeTPM` call indicates integration with Trusted Platform Modules for secure key management.
*   **Idempotency Requirement**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent, ensuring consistent behavior even if called multiple times.
*   **Detailed Error Reporting**: The use of custom error types and the `EncryptionResult` struct highlights a strong emphasis on providing detailed feedback on the status of operations, particularly regarding which targets succeeded, were already encrypted, or failed and why.
*   **Directory-based Workflow**: Operations frequently involve managing temporary "migration-store" and "migration-recovery" directories, suggesting a phased approach to encryption where data is moved out, the directory encrypted, and then data moved back in.
*   **Evolution of Dependencies**: A notable pattern is the `fscrypt.go` file moving away from a direct import of `common` for paths, suggesting an architectural decision to localize path definitions or reduce inter-package dependencies.

## 6:26:53 AM
The code changes detail the development of an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focused on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM integration. All changes are under a Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025 copyright.

        *   Introduced `EncryptionResult` to track the detailed outcome of encryption attempts, including `FailedToRecover`.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` iterated through targets, using `encryptTargetDir` for individual directory encryption.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` contained the core logic: relocating contents, recreating the target directory as empty, encrypting it, and conditionally moving contents to a recovery directory upon failure. It utilized `common.MigrationDirPath` for temporary storage.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A significant update occurred several days later.
        *   **Error Handling Refinement**: Explicit error variables `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore` were added, formalizing error types.
        *   **`EncryptionResult` Simplification**: The `FailedToRecover` field and its related logic were removed from `EncryptionResult`, `newEncryptionResult`, `Failed()`, and `BuildError()`, indicating a change in how recovery failures are tracked or reported within this component.
        *   **`EncryptTargetDirs` Refactor**: The function was refactored to use a `switch` statement for more granular handling of different error types returned by `encryptTargetDir`. Upon successful encryption, the temporary migration directory is now explicitly removed.
        *   **Path Hardcoding**: The calculation for `tempDir` within `EncryptTargetDirs` was changed from using `common.MigrationDirPath` to a hardcoded string `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`.
        *   **Recovery Logic Removal**: The `recoveryDir` parameter was removed from `encryptTargetDir`'s signature, and the associated logic for moving contents to a recovery directory (e.g., `migrateToRecoveryDir` calls) was removed, though a comment about recovery handling remained.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Integrity and Security Focus**: The entire codebase revolves around an "Integrity Handler" application designed to ensure data integrity, primarily through filesystem encryption and TPM integration.
*   **Structured Error Handling**: Go's standard error handling mechanisms (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Is`, `errors.As`, `errors.Join`) are used consistently across all files to provide robust and detailed error reporting.
*   **Idempotent Operations**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed and commented as idempotent, suggesting a requirement for reliable and repeatable execution.
*   **Dedicated Directory Structure**: A specific set of directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are consistently used for various operational purposes, including key storage paths, migration, and recovery.
*   **External Library Usage**: The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used for filesystem abstraction, and `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` is used for application logging, indicating a consistent approach to common utilities.
*   **Active Development**: The changes in `fscrypt.go` between November 21st and November 25th, particularly the streamlining of `EncryptionResult` and the refactoring of error handling, suggest an active and iterative development process focused on refining functionality and robustness. The temporary hardcoding of a path indicates ongoing work.

The content of this file remained consistent across its logged entries.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`** (Last significant timestamp: `11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM`): This file contains the core logic of the Integrity Handler. Key functionalities include:
    *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites such as root user, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`'s `CheckSupport`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
    *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, creating/resolving the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the target mount, and encrypting specified directories.
    *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories.
    *   `getFsKey`: Manages the secure retrieval and temporary storage of the filesystem key, ensuring the plain key is wiped after use.
    *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates and sets permissions for operational directories.
    *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if the recovery directory contains unexpected items.
    The content of this file was identical across all four logged timestamps, indicating no functional changes within this specific log sequence.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`** (Timestamp: `11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM`): This is the application's entry point.
    *   It defines `ExitCode` constants to standardize process return values for success, generic failure, environmental incompatibility, and integrity compromise.
    *   It uses `//go:embed` to include a version string.
    *   The `main` function parses command-line arguments (specifically a `mount` path) and calls the `run` function.
    *   The `run` function orchestrates the application's flow, including logging, initializing application state, calling integrity checks, enabling/unlocking encryption, and mapping outcomes to the defined `ExitCode` values.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**:
    *   **Initial state** (`11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM`): This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous custom error constants related to encryption failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), the `protectorName` ("FEMK"), and a `SetupOnMount` function for `fscrypt` initialization. It introduced the `EncryptionResult` struct to track detailed outcomes of encryption attempts. The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions implement the core logic for moving data, creating encrypted directories, and restoring data. At this point, it imported the `common` package.
    *   **Later state** (`11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM`): This entry shows a significant refactoring of the `fscrypt` package.
        *   The import of the `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` package was **removed**.

*   **Modular Architecture:** The code is organized into distinct packages (`common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`, `log`) for clear separation of concerns.

## 8:26:48 AM
The provided log details changes across several Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on filesystem encryption, secure key management, and directory organization.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file defined constant directory paths crucial for the Integrity Handler. These included `/boot/integrity` for handler files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted FEMK (File Encryption Master Key), and paths under `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration data, recovery, and manifest files (`.migration-store`, `migration-recovery`, `manifest.d`). The package comment initially described its role in holding secure keys and common variables.
    *   **Later update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** A minor, cosmetic change occurred where the package comment was refined to a more general "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Multiple updates (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 2:27:22 PM; 2:28:49 PM; 2:40:35 PM):** This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler. Across these entries, the content remained functionally identical. Key aspects include:
        *   **Environment Verification:** The `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` function checks for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
        *   **Encryption and Decryption:** Functions like `enableIntegrity` orchestrate the encryption process (ensuring directories exist, handling FEMK, setting up fscrypt, and encrypting targets) and `unlockEncryptedDirs` handles unlocking.
        *   **Key Management:** `getFsKey` is responsible for lazy-loading and securely handling the filesystem key using a `vault.SecureContainer`, including wiping the plain key after use.
        *   **Directory Management:** `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates all necessary directories defined in `common/directories.go` with specific permissions and includes logic to clean the migration directory. `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` logs warnings if contents are found in the recovery directory.
        *   Error handling defines `errIntegrityCompromised` for integrity violations.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Initial implementation (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This file serves as the main entry point for the application. It defines standard `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) that align with systemd service return codes. The `main` function parses a `mountPath` command-line argument and calls the `run` function, which orchestrates the entire integrity process: handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity (encryption), and unlocking directories. It logs errors and exits with the appropriate status code.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial implementation (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** Introduced high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` operations. It defined various error constants related to encryption and relocation failures, and established `protectorName` as "FEMK". The `SetupOnMount` function handled global and filesystem-specific fscrypt setup. A detailed `EncryptionResult` struct was introduced to track the status (success, already encrypted, various failure modes) of encrypting target directories. The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions outlined the multi-step process: relocating contents to a temporary directory, recreating the target directory as empty, encrypting it, and then restoring contents.
    *   **Significant update (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
        *   **Refactoring and Enhanced Error Handling:** New, more granular error constants were added for `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore`.
        *   **`EncryptionResult` Simplification:** The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its related methods (`Failed`, `BuildError`).
        *   **Dependency Change and Path Handling:** The `common` package import was removed. Consequently, `tempDir` within `EncryptTargetDirs` was hardcoded to `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/" + dirName`, replacing the previous reliance on `common.MigrationDirPath`. The `encryptTargetDir` function signature was updated to directly accept `tempDir`.
        *   **Cleanup and Detailed Error Reporting:** `EncryptTargetDirs` was modified to explicitly remove the temporary `tempDir` upon successful encryption. A `switch` statement was added to `EncryptTargetDirs` to log debug messages for specific types of encryption failures.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial definition of common directory paths in `directories.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** First recorded version of the core `integrity.go` logic, establishing environment verification, encryption/decryption flows, and directory management.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** Introduction of the `main.go` application entry point, including exit codes, command-line parsing, and overall orchestration.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright Notice:** All files consistently include the copyright notice "// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." at the beginning.
*   **"Integrity Handler" Application:** All code snippets belong to an application named "Integrity Handler", focused on ensuring system integrity, primarily through filesystem encryption.
*   **`fscrypt` Integration:** The application heavily relies on `fscrypt` for encryption, evidenced by imports from `github.com/google/fscrypt` and the dedicated `fscrypt` package.
*   **Error Handling:** A strong pattern of detailed error handling is present, using `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, `errors.Join`, and `errors.As` to provide context-rich error messages and allow for specific error type checking.
*   **Directory Management:** There's a recurring need to create, manage, and clean specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, etc.) with defined permissions, especially for temporary data during encryption or for recovery.
*   **Idempotency:** Comments explicitly state the requirement for functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` to be idempotent, indicating robustness in repeated execution.
*   **Secure Key Handling:** While specific key content is not logged, the architecture mentions `vault.SecureContainer` and the wiping of `plainKey` slices, highlighting a focus on secure handling of encryption keys.
*   **Dependency Management:** The change in `fscrypt.go` on 11/25/2025 shows a shift in dependency, where the `common` package was unimported, and a path was hardcoded. This could imply a restructuring of how shared constants are accessed or a temporary oversight.

## 9:26:50 AM
The log details development of an "Integrity Handler" application in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity checks.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go**:
    *   Initially defined a set of constants representing critical directory paths for the Integrity Handler, such as `/boot/integrity` for boot-related files, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` for migration data, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` for recovery data. The `EncryptedKeyPath` constant points to `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`.
    *   A minor update on **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM** changed the package comment from describing a secure container to simply stating it "contains common globals."

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go**:
    *   This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler. Its content remained stable across multiple timestamps on **11/21/2025** (2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM), indicating no functional changes were committed during this period.
    *   Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` which checks system requirements (root user, kernel version, fscrypt support, TPM initialization).
    *   `enableIntegrity` orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving a "FEMK" (Filesystem Encryption Master Key), setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories.
    *   `unlockEncryptedDirs` handles unlocking previously encrypted directories.
    *   `getFsKey` securely retrieves and stores the filesystem key.
    *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` creates and, if needed, cleans the various working directories.
    *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` checks for pending recovery data.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go**:
    *   Added on **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**, this file serves as the application's entry point.
    *   It defines custom `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) to align with systemd service return codes.
    *   The `main` function parses a `mount` path argument, sets logging, and calls the `run` function.
    *   The `run` function coordinates the entire process: initializes the application state, handles recovery warnings, verifies the environment, and then proceeds to `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It manages error handling and returns specific exit codes based on the outcome, including an `ExitCompromised` code for integrity violations.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go**:
    *   **Initial version (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM)**: Introduced high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` operations. It defined several error constants for various failure conditions (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`). It included a `SetupOnMount` function for global and filesystem `fscrypt` setup and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track the status of encryption operations. The `encryptTargetDir` function contained logic for relocating files, recreating directories, encrypting, and handling recovery.
    *   **Significant update (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM)**: This version introduced substantial refactoring in error handling and recovery logic.
        *   New explicit error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by removing `FailedToRecover`, and the `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated accordingly.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was revised to centralize error handling using a `switch` statement on the error returned by `encryptTargetDir`, and it now explicitly handles the removal of temporary migration directories on success.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function itself was streamlined, removing its direct handling of `recoveryDir` and pushing error reporting and specific recovery actions up to its caller (`EncryptTargetDirs`). It also showed a change in how `tempDir` was constructed, hardcoding part of the path instead of using the `common.MigrationDirPath` constant directly within its loop.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of core directory paths (`directories.go`).
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial implementation of the `integrity.go` application logic.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of the `main.go` application entry point.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of `fscrypt` wrapper functions.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A major refactoring of the `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` file, specifically improving error handling, simplifying recovery logic, and modifying the `EncryptionResult` structure.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright**: All files are consistently copyrighted "Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025".
*   **Integrity Focus**: The entire codebase revolves around "Config Integrity" using `fscrypt` for encryption, likely managed by a FEMK and secured by TPM/vTPM.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: There's a strong emphasis on detailed error reporting, using Go's `errors` package, `fmt.Errorf` with wrapping (`%w`), and custom error types to distinguish various failure modes. The refactoring in `fscrypt.go` further highlights this commitment to precise error management.
*   **Directory Management**: The code consistently creates, cleans, and monitors specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) with carefully set permissions.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed or intended to be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects.
*   **Logging**: A custom `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) is extensively used for debug, info, warning, and error messages throughout the application.
*   **Third-Party Libraries**: `github.com/google/fscrypt` and `github.com/spf13/afero` are key dependencies, providing the core encryption capabilities and an abstracted filesystem interface, respectively.
*   **Stability vs. Refactoring**: The `integrity.go` file showed stability across multiple save operations, while `fscrypt.go` underwent a significant refactoring pass after its initial implementation, indicating an iterative process of development and improvement, especially in critical areas like security and error recovery.

## 10:26:44 AM
The codebase primarily focuses on an "Integrity Handler" application in Go, designed to manage encrypted directories using `fscrypt` and TPM/vTPM. Key information revolves around directory paths, environmental setup, encryption/decryption processes, and error handling.

**File-Specific Updates and Timestamps:**

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines essential constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and the encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files).
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated. It changed from a detailed description of common secure container reliance on mmap'ed memory to a simpler `Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler.` The defined directory constants remained unchanged.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** through **11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler. Across multiple timestamps, the content remains identical, indicating a period of stable code or minor, untracked changes during this interval.
    *   Key functions include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt/metadata`), and TPM/vTPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Securely decrypts the FEMK and stores it in a `vault.SecureContainer`, explicitly wiping the plaintext key afterwards.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates all required `common` directories with specific permissions (e.g., `0o750` for migration/recovery/manifest, `0o700` for boot), and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if contents are found in the recovery directory, suggesting manual intervention.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point.
    *   It defines standard `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised), aligning with systemd service return codes.
    *   The `main` function sets up logging, parses a `mount` path command-line argument, and calls the `run` function.
    *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: logging version, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity, and unlocking directories. It maps specific errors (like `errIntegrityCompromised`) to appropriate `ExitCode` values.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
    *   It defines numerous `Err` constants for various encryption-related failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`).
    *   `SetupOnMount` performs global and filesystem-specific fscrypt setup.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the status of encryption attempts for multiple targets (success, already encrypted, various failure types).
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` iterates through target directories, relocating their contents to a temporary directory, recreating them as empty encrypted directories, and then moving the contents back. Error handling includes moving contents to a recovery directory on failure.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This entry shows significant refactoring:
        *   The `common` package import was removed, indicating a move towards more localized path management within `fscrypt.go` or explicit passing of paths.
        *   New error constants `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were explicitly added to the package.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by removing the `FailedToRecover []string` field and its related logic from `newEncryptionResult`, `Failed()`, and `BuildError()`. This suggests a change in how recovery-related failures are tracked or reported.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's error handling logic was revamped, replacing a generic `if result.Failed()` check with a `switch` statement that explicitly handles different `encryptTargetDir` errors.
        *   A `tempDir` variable within `EncryptTargetDirs` was introduced, hardcoding the migration store path (`"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`) instead of using the `common` package constant, consistent with the import removal.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was changed to accept `tempDir` as a parameter. The detailed internal logic for recovery directory handling, which previously used `common.RecoveryDirPath`, appears to have been altered or moved out of the provided snippet. Successful encryption now explicitly removes the temporary migration directory.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice**: All files include the `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` notice.
*   **Security Focus**: The overall theme is system integrity, specifically focusing on disk encryption (`fscrypt`), secure key management (`vault`, `TPM`), and recovery mechanisms.
*   **Error Handling**: Go's idiomatic error handling (returning `error` types, `errors.Is`, `errors.As`, `errors.Join`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`) is heavily used throughout the codebase. Custom error types are defined for specific failure conditions.
*   **Directory Management**: The application frequently interacts with the filesystem, creating, cleaning, and moving directories, often using the `afero` library for filesystem abstraction and `filepath` for path manipulation. Specific directories are designated for migration, recovery, and manifests.
*   **Modularity**: The code is structured into distinct packages (`common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`) under `IntegrityHandler`, suggesting a modular design.
*   **Idempotency**: The `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` functions are explicitly noted as needing to be idempotent, which is crucial for robust system operations where these functions might be called multiple times.
*   **Logging**: The `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) is consistently used for debugging, informational messages, warnings, and errors.
*   **Future Work (`TODO` comments)**: Several `TODO` comments highlight areas for future improvements, such as "best effort shred" for directory cleaning, processing manifests, incorporating a `path` parameter for upgrade use cases, and ensuring idempotency in specific flows.

## 11:26:49 AM
The provided logs detail changes across several Go source files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focusing on filesystem encryption, secure key management, and directory operations.

### File-Specific Updates and Timestamps:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of key constant paths for the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` for handler files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), and various directories under `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration data, recovery, and manifest files.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update to the package-level comment, clarifying its purpose as holding "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler" instead of referring to a secure container for keys directly in this file's description. The constant values themselves remained unchanged.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** (and subsequent timestamps at 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM): This file, central to the Integrity Handler's logic, remained stable across these timestamps without functional changes in the provided snippets. It implements core functionalities:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like root user privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt/metadata`), availability of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving/creating the FEMK, setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories. This function is noted as needing to be idempotent.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories, flagging failures as integrity compromises.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function for retrieving the filesystem key, involving decrypting the FEMK and storing it securely in a `vault.SecureContainer` before wiping the plain key.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates all required directories with specific permissions and includes logic to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if data is found in the recovery directory, suggesting manual intervention.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point.
        *   It defines `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes (success, generic failure, incompatible environment, integrity compromised).
        *   The `main` function sets logging, parses a `mount` path flag, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application's flow: logging its version, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, and then calling `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes detailed error handling to return appropriate `ExitCode`s based on the type of failure (e.g., `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations).

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of `fscrypt` wrappers.
        *   Defines various `Err` constants for specific encryption-related failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`).
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Configures `fscrypt` globally and on a specific mount path.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: A detailed structure to report the outcomes of encryption attempts, categorizing successes and different types of failures (relocation, encryption, unlocking, restore, recovery).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through target directories, checking for existing encryption before calling `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Contains the core logic for encrypting a single directory, including relocating contents to a temporary directory (`common.MigrationDirPath`), recreating the target directory as empty, encrypting it, and handling potential recovery to `common.RecoveryDirPath` in case of failures.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A significant refactor of the `fscrypt` package.
        *   New dedicated error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by removing the `FailedToRecover` category.
        *   The import of the `common` package was removed. Consequently, paths like `common.MigrationDirPath` were replaced with a hardcoded string `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"` for temporary directories within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was updated to receive the `tempDir` as an argument, and internal logic for `recoveryDir` and `migrateToRecoveryDir` was removed, indicating a shift in how recovery data is managed or reported, potentially moving this responsibility to a higher level or simplifying the recovery process.
        *   The error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` was refined to leverage the newly defined specific error types using `errors.Is`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright Notice**: All Go files consistently include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`.
*   **Integrity and Security Focus**: The entire codebase revolves around ensuring "Config Integrity" using filesystem encryption (`fscrypt`), secure key handling (FEMK, `vault.SecureContainer`, key wiping), and TPM integration, indicating a strong emphasis on system security.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: There's a recurring pattern of defining specific error types (`errors.New`, `errors.Is`, `errors.Join`) for various failure scenarios and providing detailed logging for debugging and operational visibility (`log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warn`, `log.Error`). The `EncryptionResult` struct is a prime example of structured error reporting.
*   **Directory Management**: Frequent creation, cleanup, and status checks of specific, well-defined directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are integral to the application's operation.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly noted as needing to be idempotent, implying that they should be safely executable multiple times without causing inconsistencies or errors.
*   **Dependency on `fscrypt`**: The application heavily relies on the `fscrypt` tool and its Go bindings (`github.com/google/fscrypt/`).
*   **Use of `afero`**: The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used for abstracting filesystem operations, which can be beneficial for testing and mock file systems.

## 1:26:45 PM
The `common/directories.go` file, at 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM, defined constants for critical Integrity Handler paths, including a `/boot/integrity` directory for its files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), and dedicated paths under `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration data, recovery data, and manifest files. By 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM, the comment for the `common` package was clarified to state it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," but the defined directory constants themselves remained unchanged.

The `integrity.go` file saw multiple log entries between 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM and 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM. Across these timestamps, the provided code snippet for this file remained identical. It outlines the core logic of the Integrity Handler application. Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, which checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization. The `enableIntegrity` function is responsible for setting up necessary directories, resolving and managing the FEMK (using a `vault.SecureContainer`), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories. The `unlockEncryptedDirs` function handles unlocking previously encrypted directories. An `errIntegrityCompromised` error is defined for integrity violations. Directory creation logic (`ensureDirectoriesExist`) ensures specific permissions (0o750 or 0o700) and attempts to clean the migration directory. A `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function checks and logs warnings if data is found in the recovery directory.

The `main.go` file, introduced at 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM, defines the entry point for the Integrity Handler. It establishes `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes, including `ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, and `ExitCompromised`. The `main` function parses a `--mount` flag, sets up logging, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the application flow, invoking `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes error handling to return specific exit codes based on the nature of failures, particularly distinguishing between environmental incompatibilities and integrity compromises.

The `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` file underwent significant changes between 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM and 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM.
Initially (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM), it provided high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` operations, defining several error types, a `protectorName` constant ("FEMK"), and a `SetupOnMount` function for fscrypt initialization. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracked various success and failure states, including `FailedToRecover`. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function managed the encryption process by relocating directory contents, recreating the target, encrypting it, and moving contents back, with a recovery mechanism if directory creation failed.
By 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM, several key updates were made:
- The import of `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` was removed, suggesting direct reliance on the `common` package for paths was replaced with internal or passed-in values.
- New explicit error constants `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore` were added.
- The `EncryptionResult` struct was streamlined by removing the `FailedToRecover` field, and corresponding logic in `newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, and `BuildError` functions was updated.
- The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's logic was refactored. It now constructs the temporary migration directory path using a hardcoded string rather than referencing a constant from the `common` package. It also introduces a `switch` statement to handle specific errors returned by `encryptTargetDir` and explicitly removes temporary migration directories upon success.
- The `encryptTargetDir` function itself was modified, removing the `recoveryDir` variable and the internal logic for migrating contents to a recovery directory, indicating a shift in how recovery failures are managed or reported.

**Recurring Patterns:**
- **Copyright Notices:** All files include the same copyright notice "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved."
- **Path Definitions:** Critical paths are consistently defined as constants, specifically for boot, encryption keys, migration, and recovery, located under `/boot` and `/opt/128technology/integrity`.
- **Logging:** Extensive use of `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warnf`, and `log.Errorf` from `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` for detailed operational reporting and error diagnostics.
- **Error Handling:** A strong emphasis on robust error handling, including custom error types, wrapping errors with `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, and using `errors.Join` for aggregating multiple errors.
- **Filesystem Abstraction:** `github.com/spf13/afero` is consistently used for abstracting filesystem operations.
- **Fscrypt Integration:** Deep integration with `github.com/google/fscrypt` for filesystem encryption capabilities.
- **TPM/Vault Usage:** The system relies on TPM for key initialization and a `vault.SecureContainer` for runtime key management, emphasizing security.
- **Idempotency:** The code explicitly states the requirement for idempotency in key operations like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`.

## 2:26:49 PM
The code changes primarily revolve around the `IntegrityHandler` application, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity management using `fscrypt` and TPM/vTPM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**
        This file defines constant paths for various Integrity Handler components, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`. The initial package comment described its role in containing a secure container for keys and common variables.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**
        The package comment for `common` was updated from describing its role in handling secure key containers to a more general description of containing "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined directory paths themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**
        These entries show the core logic for the Integrity Handler. Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checks system requirements like root user, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, fscrypt command, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (ensures necessary directories exist, obtains a filesystem key, sets up fscrypt, and encrypts target directories), `unlockEncryptedDirs` (unlocks previously encrypted directories), `getFsKey` (a lazy-loading function for the filesystem key that includes a security measure to wipe the plain key), and `ensureDirectoriesExist` (creates and cleans migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with specified permissions). A `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function checks and logs warnings for contents in the recovery directory. The code content for these four timestamps is identical, suggesting no functional changes were made to this file during this period.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**
        This is a newly introduced file that serves as the entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines custom `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised). The `main` function parses a `mount` path argument and calls the `run` function, which orchestrates the application's lifecycle: getting the version, handling recovery warnings, verifying the environment, enabling integrity, and unlocking directories. It handles errors from these steps, returning appropriate exit codes, especially for integrity compromises or incompatible environments. The application version is embedded from an `integrity-handler.version` file.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**
        This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error types related to encryption, relocation, and restoration processes. It introduces `protectorName` as "FEMK". The `SetupOnMount` function handles global and filesystem-specific fscrypt setup. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the success and various failure states during directory encryption. `EncryptTargetDirs` orchestrates the encryption of multiple directories, using `encryptTargetDir` for individual targets. The `encryptTargetDir` function outlines steps like relocating contents, recreating an empty directory, encrypting it, and handling recovery on failure, making use of paths defined in the `common` package.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**
        Significant refactoring occurred in this file:
        *   The import for the `common` package was removed. Consequently, paths like `MigrationDirPath` are now hardcoded within this file (e.g., `tempDir := "/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/" + dirName`).
        *   New distinct `var` error definitions were introduced for `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore`.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by removing the `FailedToRecover []string` field, and the `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated accordingly.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function now includes a `switch` statement for more explicit error handling of different failure types returned by `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function was updated to accept `tempDir` as an explicit argument, and references to a `recoveryDir` and related `migrateToRecoveryDir` calls were removed from the visible snippet, implying a change in recovery flow.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Copyright and Structure:** All Go files consistently include the "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." header and adhere to standard Go package and file naming conventions.
*   **Logging:** The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is universally imported and used for logging messages at various debug, info, warning, and error levels.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is frequently used for filesystem operations (`afero.NewOsFs()`, `afero.ReadDir`, `afero.Exists`), indicating a design choice for abstracted filesystem access.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The codebase extensively uses `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`, and `errors.Is` for detailed error creation, wrapping, and type checking, ensuring comprehensive error reporting and handling.
*   **Focus on Integrity and Encryption:** The overall project goal is "Config Integrity," involving `fscrypt` for encryption, TPM/vTPM for key management, and explicit checks for environment compatibility and integrity compromises.
*   **Idempotency Goal:** Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly commented as needing to be idempotent, which is crucial for reliability in system management applications.
*   **Future Development Markers:** Numerous `// TODO:` comments highlight areas for future improvements, such as enhanced shredding, processing manifests, better context plumbing, and robust unwind steps for failure scenarios.

## 3:26:53 PM
The provided log details the development and refinement of a Go application named "Integrity Handler," primarily focused on securing system directories through filesystem encryption, leveraging `fscrypt` and TPM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file defines several constant directory paths crucial for the Integrity Handler's operation, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`. The package comment mentions its role in holding secure keys and common variables.
    *   **Later change (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** The package comment was updated to a more concise `Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler.`, while the directory constants remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM):** This file implements core logic for the Integrity Handler. It imports `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`, and `common` packages. Key functions include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt`), availability of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates directory creation, FEMK resolution, `fscrypt` setup, and encryption of target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Retrieves the filesystem key from a secure vault after decryption.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates the various directories defined in `common/directories.go` with specific file permissions (0o750 or 0o700) and attempts to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for contents in the recovery directory.
    *   **Minor change (11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM):** The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was subtly altered. The explicit `afero.Exists` check for the `RecoveryDirPath` was removed, causing the function to directly attempt `afero.ReadDir`. If the directory doesn't exist, `ReadDir` will now return an error, which is then logged as a warning. The logic within the loop also has a potential flaw where it checks the `ReadDir` error again for each item.
    *   **No change (11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM and 2:40:35 PM):** Two entries show identical content to the preceding entry, indicating no functional changes at these specific timestamps for this file.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Introduction (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This file introduces the application's entry point (`main` function) and top-level execution logic.
        *   It defines a custom `ExitCode` enum for various process return statuses (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitCompromised`).
        *   The `main` function sets the log level, parses command-line arguments (specifically a `mount` path), and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function coordinates the application flow, including logging the version, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes comprehensive error handling to return specific `ExitCode` values based on detected issues, such as environment incompatibility or integrity compromises.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial introduction (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file defines high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` functionalities.
        *   It declares several `Err` constants for various failure scenarios during encryption/decryption.
        *   The `protectorName` is defined as "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Configures global `fscrypt` settings and sets up `fscrypt` on a given mount path.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: A detailed structure to track the outcome of encryption operations, categorizing directories into `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, `FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRestore`, and `FailedToRecover`.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through target directories, encrypting them if not already encrypted by calling `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Implements the core encryption logic: relocating contents, recreating the target directory as empty, encrypting it, and handling recovery on failure (the provided log truncates this function).
    *   **Significant Refinement (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
        *   The import of `"github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common"` was removed, indicating a refactoring to reduce direct dependency on `common` for directory paths within this package.
        *   New specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was updated, removing `FailedToRecover []string`. The `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were adjusted accordingly.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's error handling for individual targets was changed from direct appending to the `result` struct to a `switch` statement on the error returned by `encryptTargetDir`, allowing for more specific logging. It also added a cleanup step to remove the temporary migration directory on successful encryption.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was changed to accept the `tempDir` path as an argument, further reflecting the removal of the `common` import for path construction.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial definition of common directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** First commit of the core `integrity.go` logic.

*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** A significant refactoring and enhancement of the `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` package, including import removal, new error types, and updated error handling/cleanup logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice:** All files consistently include `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`, indicating a common ownership and future-dated development.
*   **Security Focus:** The application's purpose, "Integrity Handler," coupled with references to `fscrypt` (filesystem encryption), `tpm` (Trusted Platform Module), `vault.SecureContainer`, and `errIntegrityCompromised`, strongly emphasizes data integrity and security.
*   **Idempotency:** Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be called multiple times without producing different results beyond the first successful execution.
*   **Directory Management:** The application heavily relies on specific directory structures (e.g., `/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/`) for storing keys, migration data, recovery data, and manifests.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** There is a consistent and detailed approach to error management, using Go's `errors` package features (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`, `errors.Is`) alongside a custom `log` package (`log.Debug`, `log.Infof`, `log.Errorf`, `log.Warnf`) for comprehensive debugging and operational insights.
*   **Dependency on `fscrypt`:** The `github.com/google/fscrypt` library is a central dependency, forming the backbone of the filesystem encryption capabilities.
*   **Structured Application Flow:** The `main.go` introduces a well-defined `run` function that orchestrates environment verification, integrity enablement, and directory unlocking, with clear exit codes for different outcomes.

## 4:26:49 PM
The provided code log details changes across several Go files pertaining to an "Integrity Handler" application by Juniper Networks, focused on file system encryption and integrity management.

### File-Specific Updates and Timestamps:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defined common constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`. The package comment was "Package container common a secure container to hold our key at runtime, which relies on anonymous mmap'ed memory that is mlocked. As well as common variables for Integrity Handler."
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated for clarity to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined constant paths remained unchanged.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: All four log entries for this file show identical code content. No functional changes were introduced across these timestamps in the provided snippets. The file implements the core logic of the Integrity Handler. Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking system requirements like root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, fscrypt tool presence, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (which sets up required directories, manages the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), and encrypts target directories), and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It also includes functions to safely store the FEMK in a `vault.SecureContainer` and manage integrity-related directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`). An `errIntegrityCompromised` error is defined for integrity violations.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file serves as the application's entry point. It handles command-line argument parsing (specifically a `-mount` path), sets up logging, and orchestrates the integrity checks and encryption processes. It defines specific `ExitCode` values (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with systemd service return codes. The `run` function calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, handling errors to return appropriate exit codes. It also uses `go:embed` for versioning.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines several error constants related to encryption processes (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`). It includes a `SetupOnMount` function for global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup, intended to be idempotent. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the status of encryption attempts for multiple targets, including various failure modes (`FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRestore`, `FailedToRecover`). The `EncryptTargetDirs` function orchestrates the encryption of directories, involving relocating contents, creating an empty encrypted directory, and then restoring contents. It uses the `common` package for migration directory paths.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This update introduced several changes:
        *   **New Error Constants**: `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore` were explicitly added as global error variables for clearer error identification.
        *   **`EncryptionResult` Streamlining**: The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and related methods (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`), indicating a refinement or simplification of the recovery status tracking.
        *   **Migration Directory Path Handling**: In `EncryptTargetDirs`, the `tempDir` path was hardcoded as `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/" + dirName`, replacing the previous usage of `common.MigrationDirPath`. The `encryptTargetDir` function signature was also updated to explicitly accept this `tempDir`.
        *   **Improved Error Handling**: `EncryptTargetDirs` now includes a `switch` statement to handle specific error types returned from `encryptTargetDir`, allowing for more granular logging and processing of relocation, encryption, unlocking, and restoration failures.
        *   **Cleanup on Success**: A call to `fs.RemoveAll(tempDir)` was added within `EncryptTargetDirs` for successful encryption scenarios to clean up the temporary migration directory.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright**: All files consistently include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Logging**: The custom `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is widely used across all files for debugging, informational, warning, and error messages.
*   **Error Handling**: Standard Go error handling practices are prevalent, including using `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` for error wrapping, and `errors.Is` for type-checking errors. Many functions return errors.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used for filesystem operations, which suggests a design for testability or portability.
*   **`fscrypt` Integration**: There is a strong dependency on the `github.com/google/fscrypt` library and its sub-packages for managing filesystem encryption, which is central to the "Integrity Handler" functionality.
*   **Secure Key Management**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/vault` package and `vault.SecureContainer` are used for handling the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK) securely, often involving memory wiping of plain keys.
*   **TPM (Trusted Platform Module) Integration**: The `tpm.InitializeTPM` function in `integrity.go` indicates interaction with TPM/vTPM for secure key management.
*   **Directory Structure**: A consistent set of directory paths (e.g., `/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are used across the application, defined in `common/directories.go`.
*   **Idempotency**: Explicit comments highlight the importance of idempotency for functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, ensuring that repeated calls have the same effect as a single call.

## 5:26:51 PM
The provided code changes chronicle the development and refinement of an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily written in Go, which focuses on filesystem encryption and integrity using `fscrypt` and TPM-backed key management. The changes span two main files: `common/directories.go`, `integrity.go`, `main.go`, and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`. All files consistently bear a Juniper Networks copyright notice from 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defined core directory paths as constants for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` for boot files and encrypted keys, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` for migration data, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` for recovery data, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` for manifest files. Its package comment described the purpose of a secure container for keys.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated to a more general description, "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," but the defined constants remained unchanged. This suggests a clarification of the package's overall scope without altering its directory path definitions.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM)**: The file contained the core logic for the Integrity Handler. Key functions included `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (handling FEMK creation/decryption, `fscrypt` setup, and directory encryption), and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It used `getFsKey` for lazy-loading keys into a secure container. A function `ensureDirectoriesExist` was responsible for creating necessary directories and cleaning the migration path. `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` logged warnings about data in the recovery directory.
    *   **Significant Refactor (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM)**: This timestamp marks a major refactor:
        *   The `os` import was removed, indicating a shift in how file permissions (e.g., `os.FileMode`) were handled.
        *   Error logging for `fscrypt` command not found in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` changed from an immediate failure (`return fmt.Errorf`) to logging an error (`log.Errorf`) and continuing.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was simplified: it no longer directly handled directory cleaning or `RecoveryDirPath`. Instead, it now uses permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) from the `common` package, implying these constants were introduced there (though not visible in the provided `common/directories.go` logs). A `TODO` comment was added, suggesting these directories should be created during installation.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
        *   A new function `checkMigrationDirectory` was introduced. This function actively checks the `MigrationDirPath` for existing contents and returns an error if any are found, preventing overwrites of potential recovery data.
    *   **Minor Fixes (12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM)**: Subsequent timestamps show minor, largely cosmetic or stylistic changes, such as modifying `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)` in `checkMigrationDirectory`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file serves as the entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines standard `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for process termination. The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path argument, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the main flow, including version logging, handling recovery directory warnings, environment verification, enabling integrity, and unlocking directories, with detailed error mapping to the defined `ExitCode`s.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM)**: This file provided high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined numerous error types (`ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, etc.) for various encryption failures. The `SetupOnMount` function handled `fscrypt` initialization. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracked the status of encryption attempts across multiple directories. `EncryptTargetDirs` iterated through targets, calling `encryptTargetDir` to move contents, recreate, encrypt, and manage recovery, though the logic for moving contents back was incomplete.
    *   **Refactor/Bug fix (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM)**:
        *   The import for `common` was removed, which led to hardcoded paths like `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"` replacing `common.MigrationDirPath`, indicating a temporary architectural inconsistency.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by removing `FailedToRecover` tracking, suggesting a change in how recovery failures were managed.
        *   Error handling within `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to use a `switch` statement based on the error returned by `encryptTargetDir`.
    *   **Major Rework (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM)**:
        *   The `common` import was restored, resolving the hardcoded path issue and allowing the use of `common.MigrationDirPath` again.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant was restored (though not explicitly added back to `EncryptionResult` struct in the provided snippet, which could be an oversight or further refinement).
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function was significantly reworked to use a `switch` statement, allowing for distinct handling of global setup (for mount paths "" or "/") versus filesystem-specific setup (for other mount paths), with a specific note about upgrade scenarios.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's call to `encryptTargetDir` changed its return signature, now expecting `tempDir, err`. The error handling `switch` statement was further refined to deal with partial successes during relocation and to use `recoveryErr` (which implies more detailed recovery logic outside the snippet).
    *   **Minor Fixes (12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM)**: Multiple subsequent timestamps show identical content, indicating no further functional changes in this short period.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security Focus**: The codebase consistently demonstrates a strong focus on security, evident through the use of `fscrypt` for encryption, TPM for key protection, a `SecureContainer` for keys, and careful handling of directory permissions (moving towards `common` constants for consistency). The "Integrity Handler" name itself reinforces this.
*   **Idempotency Requirement**: Several functions, notably `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly marked as needing to be idempotent, critical for robust system operations where commands might be re-run.
*   **Detailed Error Handling**: A common pattern is the definition of specific error types (`ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrIntegrityCompromised`, etc.) and the use of `errors.Join` and `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` for wrapping errors, allowing for detailed error introspection. The `EncryptionResult` struct provides a comprehensive way to track the outcome of multiple encryption operations.
*   **Directory Path Management**: A significant theme is the management of specific directories for migration, recovery, and manifest files, with an evolution in how their existence, permissions, and contents are handled (e.g., moving cleanup logic from `ensureDirectoriesExist` to a dedicated `checkMigrationDirectory`).
*   **Modularity**: The application is structured into logical packages (`common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`, `log`), promoting code organization and reusability.
*   **Continuous Refinement**: The logs for `integrity.go` and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` show an iterative process of refinement, particularly in error handling, directory management, and the `fscrypt` setup logic, addressing potential edge cases or improving robustness.

## 6:26:57 PM
The log details changes across three Go files: `common/directories.go`, `integrity.go`, and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, along with the introduction of a new `main.go` file. The primary purpose of this code appears to be an "Integrity Handler" application responsible for filesystem encryption, likely using `fscrypt` and a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for key management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial creation, defining constants for critical directory paths like `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** A minor update to clarify the package-level comment from a slightly malformed description to a more concise `// Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler.`. No changes to the defined constants occurred.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** Initial version of the core `integrity` package, implementing functions for environment verification (e.g., root user, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, TPM initialization), enabling and unlocking encrypted directories, and managing directory creation (`ensureDirectoriesExist`). The initial `ensureDirectoriesExist` function included logic for cleaning a migration directory and creating a recovery directory.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM to 2:40:35 PM:** Several identical entries, indicating no functional changes in this period.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM:** A significant refactoring occurred:
        *   The `os` package import was removed.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was overhauled: it no longer defined `os.FileMode` internally, removed the logic for cleaning the migration directory, and removed the creation of `common.RecoveryDirPath`. Instead, it began relying on directory permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) presumably defined in the `common` package.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed entirely.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced. This function validates that the `common.MigrationDirPath` is empty to prevent overwriting existing recovery data from a prior failed migration attempt.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM to 4:41:11 PM:** Multiple identical entries, showing no functional changes.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM:** A minor syntax update in `checkMigrationDirectory`, changing `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)`.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** This file was introduced as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants, embeds a version string, parses command-line arguments (specifically a `--mount` path), and orchestrates the primary execution flow by calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** Initial version, providing high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` operations. It defined numerous error types related to encryption and migration failures, including `ErrFailedToRecover`. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracked various success and failure states, and the `encryptTargetDir` function handled the relocation, encryption, and restoration of directory contents. It initially used paths from the `common` package.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** A significant refactoring where:
        *   The `common` package import was removed, leading to hardcoded paths for temporary directories within `fscrypt.go`.
        *   The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct, and its consideration in `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods was dropped.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function was altered to return an error, delegating the detailed failure state reporting to the calling `EncryptTargetDirs` function via a `switch` statement.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM:** Further substantial refactoring:
        *   The `common` package import was re-introduced.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error variable was re-added (though the `FailedToRecover` field was still absent from the `EncryptionResult` struct, indicating a potential inconsistency or partial change).
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function was restructured with a `switch` statement to handle global setup for root/empty paths and specific filesystem setups.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature changed to return `(string, error)`, now passing the temporary directory path back.
        *   The error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` was expanded to provide more specific error categorization and included a placeholder for `recoveryErr` logic.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM to 4:40:46 PM:** Multiple identical entries, showing no functional changes.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** Core `integrity.go` logic established.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** Application entry point (`main.go`) introduced.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** `fscrypt` wrapper functionality implemented.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** Major refactoring in `fscrypt.go` involving dependency changes and error reporting.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM:** `fscrypt.go` underwent further significant changes, re-integrating `common` and refining setup/error handling.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM:** `integrity.go` was substantially refactored, removing old recovery logic and adding migration directory checks.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright & Versioning:** All files consistently include a Juniper Networks copyright for 2025, and `main.go` uses `//go:embed` for versioning.
*   **Integrity and Encryption Focus:** The entire codebase revolves around securing directories through `fscrypt` encryption, managed by the "Integrity Handler" application.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** A strong emphasis on detailed error reporting is evident, with numerous custom error variables (e.g., `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrIntegrityCompromised`) and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track multi-stage failures. The pattern of `errors.Join` for composite errors is used.
*   **Idempotency as a Goal:** Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly marked with "Important: this function must be idempotent," highlighting a design principle for reliability.
*   **Directory Management & Recovery:** There's an iterative development pattern around managing temporary and recovery directories (`.migration-store`, `migration-recovery`). Initial manual cleanup and warning logic in `integrity.go` evolved into a more formalized `checkMigrationDirectory` function and reliance on permission constants. The `fscrypt.go` file also went through phases of removing and re-introducing aspects of recovery-related error reporting and `common` package usage.
*   **"TODO" Comments:** Numerous "TODO" comments indicate ongoing development, planned features (e.g., processing manifests, incorporating `path` for upgrades), and areas for future improvement (e.g., "best effort shred," "correct unwind steps").
*   **No-op Commits:** Several timestamps show identical file content, suggesting frequent saves or commits that did not introduce functional code changes.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Defines constants for critical directory paths: `/boot/integrity` (`BootDirPath`), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (`EncryptedKeyPath`), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (`MigrationDirPath`), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (`RecoveryDirPath`), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (`ManifestDirPath`).
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor documentation update to the package comment, clarifying its purpose as holding "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM**: Multiple entries for this file show identical content, suggesting reformatting or non-functional commits. The code defines core integrity functions like `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checks root user, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (orchestrates directory creation, FEMK resolution, `fscrypt` setup, and encryption), `unlockEncryptedDirs`, and `getFsKey`. The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function initially created various integrity-related directories with specific permissions and included logic to clean the `MigrationDirPath`. `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` was also present to log issues in the recovery directory.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM - 4:42:37 PM**:
        *   The `os` import was removed, indicating a refactoring of file system operations to potentially rely more on the `afero.Fs` abstraction or `common` package for permissions.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was significantly refactored:
            *   It now uses permission constants (`common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms`), implying these constants were introduced in the `common` package (though not shown in these logs).
            *   The cleanup logic for `MigrationDirPath` was removed.
            *   The creation of `RecoveryDirPath` was removed from this function.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was entirely removed.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced. This function actively checks if `MigrationDirPath` contains any files and returns an error if it's not empty, preventing overwrites of potential recovery data.
        *   Error handling for `exec.LookPath("fscrypt")` in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was changed from returning an error to merely logging it, allowing the program to continue even if `fscrypt` is not found, which could be a change in operational tolerance or an oversight.
        *   A minor stylistic change was made in `checkMigrationDirectory` to declare `errs` slice.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This log provides the `main` package entry point. It defines custom `ExitCode` constants (0 for success, 1 for generic failure, 6 for incompatible environment, 78 for integrity compromised). The `main` function processes a `-mount` flag, sets up logging, and calls the `run` function which orchestrates the integrity handler's lifecycle, including environment verification and encryption/unlocking, returning specific `ExitCode`s based on outcomes. It explicitly calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings()` from `integrity.go`.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial version of the `fscrypt` wrapper. It defines numerous error types related to encryption and migration (`ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, etc.). The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks success and various failure modes, including `FailedToRecover`. `SetupOnMount` handles `fscrypt` global and filesystem setup. `EncryptTargetDirs` calls `encryptTargetDir` which relocates files, encrypts the directory, and then restores the files.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**:
        *   The import of `common` package was temporarily removed, leading to hardcoded paths for temporary migration directories (e.g., `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`).
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was modified, removing `FailedToRecover`.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature changed to accept `tempDir` as a parameter and return a single `error`, with error handling logic moved to the calling `EncryptTargetDirs` function.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM - 4:40:46 PM**:
        *   The `common` package import was re-added, allowing the use of centralized directory constants again.
        *   `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-introduced into the error definitions and the `EncryptionResult` struct.
        *   `SetupOnMount` logic was refactored using a `switch` statement to clearly distinguish between global (`""` or `"/"`) and filesystem-specific mount path setups.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function signature changed again, now returning `(string, error)` (the `tempDir` it used and any error), making its internal temporary directory creation more self-contained. The calling `EncryptTargetDirs` function now implements more robust error handling and recovery attempts based on the error returned by `encryptTargetDir`, including attempts to move contents back for relocation failures.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of core directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of `main.go` and the high-level application orchestration.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of `fscrypt` wrappers and encryption logic.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactoring in `fscrypt.go` (temporary removal of `common` import, changes to `EncryptionResult` and `encryptTargetDir` signature). This appears to be a phase of heavy development and reorganization.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM - 4:42:37 PM**: Extensive refactoring and stabilization in both `integrity.go` and `fscrypt.go`. This includes re-integrating `common` constants, refining error handling, introducing stricter migration directory checks, and clarifying `fscrypt` setup logic.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright:** All code entries start with `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`, indicating a consistent ownership and branding.
*   **Integrity Handler Focus:** The entire codebase revolves around the "Integrity Handler" application, with core functionalities related to securing system files and configuration using encryption.
*   **Go Language Best Practices:** Consistent use of `context` for cancellation, `errors.Join` for aggregated errors, and detailed error messages, aligning with modern Go error handling.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction (`afero`):** The use of `github.com/spf13/afero` throughout the filesystem-related operations (`ensureDirectoriesExist`, `EncryptTargetDirs`, `checkMigrationDirectory`) indicates a design choice for testability and flexibility in handling file system operations.
*   **`fscrypt` Integration:** Deep reliance on `github.com/google/fscrypt` for actual filesystem encryption, with custom wrappers and error handling built around it.
*   **Directory Management and Migration:** A significant recurring theme is the careful management of directories for migration and recovery during encryption. There's an evolution from a "cleanup if present" approach to a stricter "error if not empty" approach for migration directories, highlighting a focus on data integrity and preventing data loss.
*   **Idempotency:** Explicit comments emphasize that `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` must be idempotent, suggesting that these operations should safely handle being called multiple times without adverse effects.
*   **Security Focus:** References to TPM/vTPM initialization (`tpm.InitializeTPM`) and secure key containers (`vault.SecureContainer`) underscore the application's security-critical nature.
*   **Iterative Development:** The multiple timestamp entries, especially for `integrity.go` and `fscrypt.go`, show an iterative development process with refactoring, minor fixes, and a gradual improvement in error handling and architectural clarity. The temporary removal and re-addition of `common` import in `fscrypt.go` illustrates this refactoring process.
