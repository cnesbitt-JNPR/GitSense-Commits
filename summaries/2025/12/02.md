# Activity Summary for 12/2/2025

## 12:26:53 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go source files belonging to an "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on filesystem encryption and secure key management. The changes occurred between November 21st, 2025, and December 1st, 2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defined constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`.
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated to a more general description, from detailing a secure container for keys to simply stating it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." No changes to the defined constants.

**2. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: Multiple log entries show identical code, indicating minor re-saves or formatting changes without functional impact. This version established the core logic: `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` for system checks (root, kernel version, fscrypt support, TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` for encryption, `unlockEncryptedDirs` for decryption, and `ensureDirectoriesExist` to set up necessary directories with specific permissions and clean migration paths. It also included `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to check for data in recovery directories.
*   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This was a significant refactoring:
    *   The `os` import was removed.
    *   Error handling for `exec.LookPath("fscrypt")` changed from returning a fatal error to logging an error, allowing the program to continue.
    *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was refactored to use new permission constants (`common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms`) from the `common` package, replacing hardcoded `os.FileMode` values.
    *   The logic to clean `MigrationDirPath` contents was removed from `ensureDirectoriesExist`, as was the creation of `RecoveryDirPath`.
    *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
    *   A new function `checkMigrationDirectory` was introduced, which checks for existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath` and returns an error if found, preventing overwrites of recovery data.
*   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:41:11 PM**: Again, multiple identical log entries, likely minor saves.
*   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory`, updating a slice declaration from `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)`.

**3. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file, serving as the application's entry point, was introduced. It defines standard `ExitCode` constants, embeds the application version, parses a `mountPath` flag, and orchestrates the integrity handling process by calling `run()`. The `run()` function calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, handling their return values and exiting with appropriate codes, including `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

**4. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial version of the fscrypt wrapper package. It defined various error constants, `SetupOnMount` for fscrypt initialization, an `EncryptionResult` struct to track encryption outcomes (successes and different failure types), and `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions to manage the encryption process, including relocating files temporarily.
*   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Significant changes were made:
    *   The import of `common` package was *removed*, and directory paths like `MigrationDirPath` were hardcoded temporarily.
    *   New specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was modified, specifically removing `FailedToRecover []string`.
    *   `SetupOnMount` logic was refactored to simplify global setup conditions.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions underwent major refactoring, altering their signatures and error handling to provide more granular failure reporting within the `EncryptTargetDirs` function, including a `switch err` block for handling different failure types.
*   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: This update reversed some previous changes and introduced new logic:
    *   The `common` package import was *re-added*, indicating a return to using shared directory path constants.
    *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant was added back, and the `FailedToRecover []string` field was re-introduced into the `EncryptionResult` struct.
    *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored again with a `switch` statement to distinctly handle global setup (for empty or "/" mount paths) versus specific filesystem setup.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to use `common.MigrationDirPath` again for temporary directories and expanded error recovery logic within its `switch err` block.
*   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM**: Several identical log entries, likely minor saves.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright and Authorship**: All files consistently include the copyright notice "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved."
*   **Consistent Development Window**: The changes fall into two distinct periods: November 21st, 2025, and November 25th to December 1st, 2025, suggesting concentrated development or refactoring efforts.
*   **Focus on Integrity and Encryption**: The codebase is dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" application, heavily relying on `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, TPM for key management, and `afero` for filesystem operations.
*   **Robust Error Handling Evolution**: There's a clear pattern of refining error handling. This includes defining specific error types (e.g., `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`), centralizing error reporting through the `EncryptionResult` struct, and evolving how these errors are processed and reported in functions like `EncryptTargetDirs`. The handling of `fscrypt` command not found also shifted from a fatal error to a logged warning.
*   **Directory Management and Recovery**: Management of dedicated directories for migration, recovery, and manifests (`/opt/128technology/integrity/` paths and `/boot/integrity`) is a central theme. The permissions and recovery checks for these directories were refined over time, with the `common` package playing a crucial role in standardizing paths and, eventually, permissions.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed and commented as idempotent, crucial for reliable system operations.

The provided log details changes across three Go source files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant paths for Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (encrypted FEMK path), and various `/opt/128technology/integrity` subdirectories for migration, recovery, and manifests.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor documentation update changed the package comment from describing a secure container to stating it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** (and subsequent timestamps until 2:40:35 PM with no functional changes): This file implements core integrity logic. It includes functions to:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt`), `fscrypt` command existence, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates directory existence, FEMK (File Encryption Master Key) resolution, `fscrypt` setup, and encryption of target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Securely decrypts and loads the FEMK into memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates necessary directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) with specific permissions, including logic to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if residual data is found in the recovery directory.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM** (and subsequent identical entries until 4:42:37 PM, with a minor syntax change at the last timestamp):
        *   The `os` package import was removed, indicating a potential refactoring of how file modes are handled.
        *   Error handling for `exec.LookPath("fscrypt")` changed from returning a fatal error to merely logging a warning, suggesting a more resilient startup process.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was refactored to use permission constants (`common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms`) from the `common` package, implying these were defined there. The creation of `RecoveryDirPath` and the logic to clean `MigrationDirPath` were removed from this function.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
        *   A new `checkMigrationDirectory` function was added to explicitly check for any existing contents in `MigrationDirPath` and return an error if found, preventing accidental overwrites during migration attempts.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point.
        *   It defines `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for distinct process return values.
        *   Uses `//go:embed` to include the application version.
        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path argument, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function handles the main application flow: logging version, initializing application state, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes specific error handling to differentiate between environmental incompatibility, general failures, and integrity compromises, returning corresponding `ExitCode` values.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial version introduced high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error constants related to encryption and migration failures, the `FEMK` protector name, `SetupOnMount` logic, and an `EncryptionResult` struct to detail outcomes. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function orchestrates encryption, relocating contents to a temporary directory (`common.MigrationDirPath`) before encrypting the target, and includes partial logic for recovery.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This was a significant refactoring:
        *   The import for `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` was **removed**, leading to hardcoded paths for temporary directories (e.g., `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`).
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and associated error handling (`Failed()`, `BuildError()`) were streamlined by **removing** the `FailedToRecover` field and its corresponding error logic.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's error handling for `encryptTargetDir` was updated to use a `switch` statement for specific error types, and it includes logic to remove temporary migration directories upon success.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM** (and subsequent identical entries until 4:40:46 PM): This revert and enhancement brought back the `common` package import.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant and the `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` (and related logic in `Failed()` and `BuildError()`) were **re-added**.
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function was significantly refactored to use a `switch` statement for `mountPath`, explicitly handling global fscrypt setup (for empty string or `/` mount paths) separately from filesystem-specific setups. This provides more robust and specific setup procedures.
        *   The error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` for `ErrFailedToRelocate` was updated with a comment about attempting recovery, indicating further development in recovery logic.

*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Significant changes in both `fscrypt.go` and `integrity.go`:
    *   In `fscrypt.go`, the `common` package dependency was re-introduced, `FailedToRecover` logic restored, and `SetupOnMount` gained more sophisticated mount-path-based logic.
    *   In `integrity.go`, directory creation and recovery warning logic was updated, with `os` import removed, permissions externalized to the `common` package (implying `common` updates not shown in log), and a new `checkMigrationDirectory` function added.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All code snippets include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`.
*   **Integrity Handler Focus**: The code consistently revolves around the "Integrity Handler" application, emphasizing secure key management (`FEMK`, `vault.SecureContainer`), filesystem encryption (`fscrypt`), and robust error handling for integrity violations.
*   **Robust Error Management**: Extensive use of Go's `errors` package (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`, `errors.Is`) for detailed and structured error reporting.
*   **Logging**: Widespread use of `log` functions (Debug, Info, Warnf, Errorf) for tracing execution and reporting operational status and issues.
*   **Idempotency Requirement**: Several critical functions, such as `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly noted as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for reliable, repeatable operations.
*   **Evolution of Migration/Recovery Logic**: There's an ongoing refinement of the directory creation, cleanup, and error recovery strategies, particularly visible in the changes to `integrity.go`'s directory functions and `fscrypt.go`'s encryption and error handling. This suggests an active development cycle focused on robustness.

## 2:27:01 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go source files belonging to an "Integrity Handler" application: `common/directories.go`, `integrity.go`, and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, along with the introduction of `main.go`. The overall theme revolves around securing a system using fscrypt encryption, TPM integration, and robust directory management for migration and recovery.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM)**: This file defines essential constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (for core files), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files).
    *   **Minor change (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM)**: A cosmetic change was made to the package comment, rephrasing it for clarity without altering any constants or functionality.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial implementation (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM)**: This version established core Integrity Handler logic. It included functions to verify the environment (root, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` utility presence, and TPM initialization), enable integrity (which involved ensuring directories, creating/resolving FEMK, setting up fscrypt, and encrypting target directories), unlock encrypted directories, and lazily load the filesystem key into a secure container. It also defined an `ensureDirectoriesExist` function with hardcoded permissions and a `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function to check the recovery directory.
    *   **Major refactoring and hardening (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM)**:
        *   The `os` import was removed.
        *   Error handling for the `fscrypt` command lookup changed from returning an error to logging a warning, potentially allowing the process to continue.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was significantly simplified, removing `RecoveryDirPath` creation and cleaning logic for `MigrationDirPath`. Directory permissions are now fetched from `common` package constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`), suggesting `directories.go` was updated to include these. A `TODO` comment was added, suggesting these directories should be created during installation.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was replaced by `checkMigrationDirectory`. This new function specifically checks `common.MigrationDirPath` for any remaining contents from a failed migration and will error if found, preventing potential data loss due to overwriting.
    *   **Subsequent changes (12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM - 4:42:37 PM)**: These entries show minor or no functional differences, primarily re-saves or trivial refactoring (e.g., `var errs []error = make` to `errs := make`).

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Introduced (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM)**: This new file serves as the main entry point for the application. It handles command-line argument parsing (`-mount`), sets up logging, and orchestrates the `run` function. It defines specific `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) to align with standard process return values, especially for systemd services. The `run` function calls `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, and maps internal errors to the appropriate exit codes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial implementation (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM)**: This file provided high-level wrappers for fscrypt operations. It defined various specific error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), implemented `SetupOnMount` for fscrypt, and introduced the `EncryptionResult` struct to detail encryption outcomes (including `FailedToRecover`). The `EncryptTargetDirs` function managed the encryption workflow, which involved relocating directory contents, encrypting the empty target, and then restoring the contents. It directly used paths from the `common` package.
    *   **Intermediate refactoring (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM)**: This version saw the **removal of the `common` package import** and, consequently, the replacement of `common.MigrationDirPath` with a hardcoded path. The `EncryptionResult` struct was updated to **remove the `FailedToRecover` field** and related error handling. `SetupOnMount` logic was slightly simplified. The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions were refactored for improved error handling, with `encryptTargetDir` now returning an error to be handled by the caller.
    *   **Reversion and further refinement (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM)**: This update **re-added the `common` package import** and **re-introduced the `ErrFailedToRecover` error type** and its corresponding `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult`. `SetupOnMount` was refactored with a more robust `switch` statement to differentiate global setup (`""`, `/`) from specific mount path setup. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to handle `recoveryErr` in the `ErrFailedToRelocate` case, signifying an enhanced recovery mechanism for failures during relocation.
    *   **Subsequent changes (12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM - 4:40:46 PM)**: These entries indicate minor or no functional changes, likely re-saves.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Core directory constants defined.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial commit of the main integrity logic.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of `main.go`, formalizing application entry and exit codes.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial fscrypt integration details.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Intermediate fscrypt refactoring, notably removing `common` import and `FailedToRecover`.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Reversion in fscrypt, re-integrating `common` and `FailedToRecover` with more refined setup and error handling.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Major updates to `integrity.go` for directory management and migration checks.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All files consistently include the `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` header.
*   **Strong Focus on Security**: The code frequently mentions "Integrity Handler," "secure container," "FEMK encryption," "TPM initialization," and "integrity compromised," highlighting its primary purpose of ensuring system integrity and data security.
*   **Fscrypt Integration**: The `github.com/google/fscrypt` library is a cornerstone, being used across `integrity.go` and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` for filesystem encryption, setup, and unlocking operations.
*   **Error Handling and Reporting**: There's a clear pattern of detailed error handling using Go's `errors` package, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`, and specific error types (e.g., `ErrFailedToRelocate`). The `EncryptionResult` struct is a dedicated mechanism for reporting the granular success/failure of encryption operations.
*   **Idempotency**: Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly marked as "idempotent," indicating a design principle to allow multiple calls without adverse effects.
*   **Directory Path Management**: Consistent definition and use of dedicated directories (e.g., `/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`) for specific purposes, along with functions to ensure their existence and manage their state, is a key architectural pattern.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: The timestamped changes reveal an iterative development process, particularly in `fscrypt.go`, with phases of experimentation (like temporarily removing `common` imports) followed by re-integration and more robust solutions. This suggests continuous improvement and hardening of the codebase.
