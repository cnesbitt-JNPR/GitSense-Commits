# Activity Summary for 12/2/2025

## 12:26:53 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go source files belonging to an "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on filesystem encryption and secure key management. The changes occurred between November 21st, 2025, and December 1st, 2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defined constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`.
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated to a more general description, from detailing a secure container for keys to simply stating it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." No changes to the defined constants.

**2. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: Multiple log entries show identical code, indicating minor re-saves or formatting changes without functional impact. This version established the core logic: `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` for system checks (root, kernel version, fscrypt support, TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` for encryption, `unlockEncryptedDirs` for decryption, and `ensureDirectoriesExist` to set up necessary directories with specific permissions and clean migration paths. It also included `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to check for data in recovery directories.
*   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This was a significant refactoring:
    *   The `os` import was removed.
    *   Error handling for `exec.LookPath("fscrypt")` changed from returning a fatal error to logging an error, allowing the program to continue.
    *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was refactored to use new permission constants (`common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms`) from the `common` package, replacing hardcoded `os.FileMode` values.
    *   The logic to clean `MigrationDirPath` contents was removed from `ensureDirectoriesExist`, as was the creation of `RecoveryDirPath`.
    *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
    *   A new function `checkMigrationDirectory` was introduced, which checks for existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath` and returns an error if found, preventing overwrites of recovery data.
*   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:41:11 PM**: Again, multiple identical log entries, likely minor saves.
*   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory`, updating a slice declaration from `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)`.

**3. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file, serving as the application's entry point, was introduced. It defines standard `ExitCode` constants, embeds the application version, parses a `mountPath` flag, and orchestrates the integrity handling process by calling `run()`. The `run()` function calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, handling their return values and exiting with appropriate codes, including `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

**4. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial version of the fscrypt wrapper package. It defined various error constants, `SetupOnMount` for fscrypt initialization, an `EncryptionResult` struct to track encryption outcomes (successes and different failure types), and `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions to manage the encryption process, including relocating files temporarily.
*   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Significant changes were made:
    *   The import of `common` package was *removed*, and directory paths like `MigrationDirPath` were hardcoded temporarily.
    *   New specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was modified, specifically removing `FailedToRecover []string`.
    *   `SetupOnMount` logic was refactored to simplify global setup conditions.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions underwent major refactoring, altering their signatures and error handling to provide more granular failure reporting within the `EncryptTargetDirs` function, including a `switch err` block for handling different failure types.
*   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: This update reversed some previous changes and introduced new logic:
    *   The `common` package import was *re-added*, indicating a return to using shared directory path constants.
    *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant was added back, and the `FailedToRecover []string` field was re-introduced into the `EncryptionResult` struct.
    *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored again with a `switch` statement to distinctly handle global setup (for empty or "/" mount paths) versus specific filesystem setup.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to use `common.MigrationDirPath` again for temporary directories and expanded error recovery logic within its `switch err` block.
*   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM**: Several identical log entries, likely minor saves.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright and Authorship**: All files consistently include the copyright notice "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved."
*   **Consistent Development Window**: The changes fall into two distinct periods: November 21st, 2025, and November 25th to December 1st, 2025, suggesting concentrated development or refactoring efforts.
*   **Focus on Integrity and Encryption**: The codebase is dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" application, heavily relying on `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, TPM for key management, and `afero` for filesystem operations.
*   **Robust Error Handling Evolution**: There's a clear pattern of refining error handling. This includes defining specific error types (e.g., `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`), centralizing error reporting through the `EncryptionResult` struct, and evolving how these errors are processed and reported in functions like `EncryptTargetDirs`. The handling of `fscrypt` command not found also shifted from a fatal error to a logged warning.
*   **Directory Management and Recovery**: Management of dedicated directories for migration, recovery, and manifests (`/opt/128technology/integrity/` paths and `/boot/integrity`) is a central theme. The permissions and recovery checks for these directories were refined over time, with the `common` package playing a crucial role in standardizing paths and, eventually, permissions.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed and commented as idempotent, crucial for reliable system operations.

## 1:26:51 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go source files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant paths for Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (encrypted FEMK path), and various `/opt/128technology/integrity` subdirectories for migration, recovery, and manifests.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor documentation update changed the package comment from describing a secure container to stating it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** (and subsequent timestamps until 2:40:35 PM with no functional changes): This file implements core integrity logic. It includes functions to:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt`), `fscrypt` command existence, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates directory existence, FEMK (File Encryption Master Key) resolution, `fscrypt` setup, and encryption of target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Securely decrypts and loads the FEMK into memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates necessary directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) with specific permissions, including logic to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if residual data is found in the recovery directory.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM** (and subsequent identical entries until 4:42:37 PM, with a minor syntax change at the last timestamp):
        *   The `os` package import was removed, indicating a potential refactoring of how file modes are handled.
        *   Error handling for `exec.LookPath("fscrypt")` changed from returning a fatal error to merely logging a warning, suggesting a more resilient startup process.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was refactored to use permission constants (`common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms`) from the `common` package, implying these were defined there. The creation of `RecoveryDirPath` and the logic to clean `MigrationDirPath` were removed from this function.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
        *   A new `checkMigrationDirectory` function was added to explicitly check for any existing contents in `MigrationDirPath` and return an error if found, preventing accidental overwrites during migration attempts.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point.
        *   It defines `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for distinct process return values.
        *   Uses `//go:embed` to include the application version.
        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path argument, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function handles the main application flow: logging version, initializing application state, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes specific error handling to differentiate between environmental incompatibility, general failures, and integrity compromises, returning corresponding `ExitCode` values.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial version introduced high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error constants related to encryption and migration failures, the `FEMK` protector name, `SetupOnMount` logic, and an `EncryptionResult` struct to detail outcomes. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function orchestrates encryption, relocating contents to a temporary directory (`common.MigrationDirPath`) before encrypting the target, and includes partial logic for recovery.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This was a significant refactoring:
        *   The import for `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` was **removed**, leading to hardcoded paths for temporary directories (e.g., `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`).
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and associated error handling (`Failed()`, `BuildError()`) were streamlined by **removing** the `FailedToRecover` field and its corresponding error logic.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's error handling for `encryptTargetDir` was updated to use a `switch` statement for specific error types, and it includes logic to remove temporary migration directories upon success.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM** (and subsequent identical entries until 4:40:46 PM): This revert and enhancement brought back the `common` package import.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant and the `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` (and related logic in `Failed()` and `BuildError()`) were **re-added**.
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function was significantly refactored to use a `switch` statement for `mountPath`, explicitly handling global fscrypt setup (for empty string or `/` mount paths) separately from filesystem-specific setups. This provides more robust and specific setup procedures.
        *   The error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` for `ErrFailedToRelocate` was updated with a comment about attempting recovery, indicating further development in recovery logic.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial commit of the core `integrity.go` logic, establishing environment checks, encryption, and directory management.

*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, removing dependency on the `common` package for paths and streamlining error handling by temporarily removing `FailedToRecover` logic.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Significant changes in both `fscrypt.go` and `integrity.go`:
    *   In `fscrypt.go`, the `common` package dependency was re-introduced, `FailedToRecover` logic restored, and `SetupOnMount` gained more sophisticated mount-path-based logic.
    *   In `integrity.go`, directory creation and recovery warning logic was updated, with `os` import removed, permissions externalized to the `common` package (implying `common` updates not shown in log), and a new `checkMigrationDirectory` function added.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All code snippets include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`.
*   **Integrity Handler Focus**: The code consistently revolves around the "Integrity Handler" application, emphasizing secure key management (`FEMK`, `vault.SecureContainer`), filesystem encryption (`fscrypt`), and robust error handling for integrity violations.
*   **Robust Error Management**: Extensive use of Go's `errors` package (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`, `errors.Is`) for detailed and structured error reporting.
*   **Logging**: Widespread use of `log` functions (Debug, Info, Warnf, Errorf) for tracing execution and reporting operational status and issues.
*   **Idempotency Requirement**: Several critical functions, such as `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly noted as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for reliable, repeatable operations.
*   **Evolution of Migration/Recovery Logic**: There's an ongoing refinement of the directory creation, cleanup, and error recovery strategies, particularly visible in the changes to `integrity.go`'s directory functions and `fscrypt.go`'s encryption and error handling. This suggests an active development cycle focused on robustness.

## 2:27:01 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go source files belonging to an "Integrity Handler" application: `common/directories.go`, `integrity.go`, and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, along with the introduction of `main.go`. The overall theme revolves around securing a system using fscrypt encryption, TPM integration, and robust directory management for migration and recovery.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM)**: This file defines essential constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (for core files), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files).
    *   **Minor change (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM)**: A cosmetic change was made to the package comment, rephrasing it for clarity without altering any constants or functionality.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial implementation (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM)**: This version established core Integrity Handler logic. It included functions to verify the environment (root, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` utility presence, and TPM initialization), enable integrity (which involved ensuring directories, creating/resolving FEMK, setting up fscrypt, and encrypting target directories), unlock encrypted directories, and lazily load the filesystem key into a secure container. It also defined an `ensureDirectoriesExist` function with hardcoded permissions and a `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function to check the recovery directory.
    *   **Major refactoring and hardening (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM)**:
        *   The `os` import was removed.
        *   Error handling for the `fscrypt` command lookup changed from returning an error to logging a warning, potentially allowing the process to continue.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was significantly simplified, removing `RecoveryDirPath` creation and cleaning logic for `MigrationDirPath`. Directory permissions are now fetched from `common` package constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`), suggesting `directories.go` was updated to include these. A `TODO` comment was added, suggesting these directories should be created during installation.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was replaced by `checkMigrationDirectory`. This new function specifically checks `common.MigrationDirPath` for any remaining contents from a failed migration and will error if found, preventing potential data loss due to overwriting.
    *   **Subsequent changes (12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM - 4:42:37 PM)**: These entries show minor or no functional differences, primarily re-saves or trivial refactoring (e.g., `var errs []error = make` to `errs := make`).

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Introduced (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM)**: This new file serves as the main entry point for the application. It handles command-line argument parsing (`-mount`), sets up logging, and orchestrates the `run` function. It defines specific `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) to align with standard process return values, especially for systemd services. The `run` function calls `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, and maps internal errors to the appropriate exit codes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial implementation (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM)**: This file provided high-level wrappers for fscrypt operations. It defined various specific error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), implemented `SetupOnMount` for fscrypt, and introduced the `EncryptionResult` struct to detail encryption outcomes (including `FailedToRecover`). The `EncryptTargetDirs` function managed the encryption workflow, which involved relocating directory contents, encrypting the empty target, and then restoring the contents. It directly used paths from the `common` package.
    *   **Intermediate refactoring (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM)**: This version saw the **removal of the `common` package import** and, consequently, the replacement of `common.MigrationDirPath` with a hardcoded path. The `EncryptionResult` struct was updated to **remove the `FailedToRecover` field** and related error handling. `SetupOnMount` logic was slightly simplified. The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions were refactored for improved error handling, with `encryptTargetDir` now returning an error to be handled by the caller.
    *   **Reversion and further refinement (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM)**: This update **re-added the `common` package import** and **re-introduced the `ErrFailedToRecover` error type** and its corresponding `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult`. `SetupOnMount` was refactored with a more robust `switch` statement to differentiate global setup (`""`, `/`) from specific mount path setup. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to handle `recoveryErr` in the `ErrFailedToRelocate` case, signifying an enhanced recovery mechanism for failures during relocation.
    *   **Subsequent changes (12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM - 4:40:46 PM)**: These entries indicate minor or no functional changes, likely re-saves.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Core directory constants defined.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial commit of the main integrity logic.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of `main.go`, formalizing application entry and exit codes.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial fscrypt integration details.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Intermediate fscrypt refactoring, notably removing `common` import and `FailedToRecover`.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Reversion in fscrypt, re-integrating `common` and `FailedToRecover` with more refined setup and error handling.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Major updates to `integrity.go` for directory management and migration checks.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All files consistently include the `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` header.
*   **Strong Focus on Security**: The code frequently mentions "Integrity Handler," "secure container," "FEMK encryption," "TPM initialization," and "integrity compromised," highlighting its primary purpose of ensuring system integrity and data security.
*   **Fscrypt Integration**: The `github.com/google/fscrypt` library is a cornerstone, being used across `integrity.go` and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` for filesystem encryption, setup, and unlocking operations.
*   **Error Handling and Reporting**: There's a clear pattern of detailed error handling using Go's `errors` package, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`, and specific error types (e.g., `ErrFailedToRelocate`). The `EncryptionResult` struct is a dedicated mechanism for reporting the granular success/failure of encryption operations.
*   **Idempotency**: Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly marked as "idempotent," indicating a design principle to allow multiple calls without adverse effects.
*   **Directory Path Management**: Consistent definition and use of dedicated directories (e.g., `/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`) for specific purposes, along with functions to ensure their existence and manage their state, is a key architectural pattern.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: The timestamped changes reveal an iterative development process, particularly in `fscrypt.go`, with phases of experimentation (like temporarily removing `common` imports) followed by re-integration and more robust solutions. This suggests continuous improvement and hardening of the codebase.

## 3:27:04 AM
The log details the development of an "Integrity Handler" Go application focused on securing directories using filesystem encryption (`fscrypt`).

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Introduced constants defining critical directory paths for the Integrity Handler, such as `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, and various migration, recovery, and manifest directories under `/opt/128technology/integrity/`.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update to the package comment; no functional changes to the constants. (Implicitly, permission constants like `MigrationDirPerms` were added to this package later to support changes in `integrity.go`.)

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM (and subsequent identical entries until 2:40:35 PM)**: Implemented core application logic including `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root user, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command presence, TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (setting up fscrypt, creating/decrypting FEMK, encrypting target directories), `unlockEncryptedDirs`, and `getFsKey` for lazy-loading keys. The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function created necessary directories with hardcoded permissions and included logic to clean the migration directory and warn about recovery directory contents.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM (and subsequent identical entries until 4:41:11 PM)**: Underwent a significant refactor. The `os` import was removed, suggesting a greater reliance on the `afero.Fs` abstraction. Error handling for `fscrypt` command lookup shifted from exiting to logging a warning. Crucially, `ensureDirectoriesExist` was updated to use permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) from the `common` package, centralizing permission management. The directory cleanup and recovery warning logic were removed from `ensureDirectoriesExist` and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` (which was deleted). A new `checkMigrationDirectory` function was introduced to explicitly validate the migration directory's state, preventing overwrites.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` related to slice declaration.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduced as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants aligned with systemd service return values, embeds a version string, parses a mount path, and orchestrates calls to the environment verification, directory handling, and encryption/unlocking functions. It handles errors by mapping them to specific exit codes like `ExitIncompatible` or `ExitCompromised`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Introduced high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined numerous error constants related to encryption failures, implemented `SetupOnMount` for fscrypt initialization, and `EncryptTargetDirs` for encrypting specified directories. The `EncryptionResult` struct was used to track success and various failure states (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, recover). This version explicitly imported the `common` package.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Experienced a significant refactoring. The `common` package import was temporarily removed, leading to hardcoded paths for temporary migration directories. The `SetupOnMount` logic was revised. The `EncryptionResult` struct and its related methods (`Failed()`, `BuildError()`) were updated by removing the `FailedToRecover` field, indicating a shift in error reporting. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was also updated to reflect changes in `encryptTargetDir`'s return values and error handling.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM (and subsequent identical entries until 4:40:46 PM)**: Underwent further refinement and partial reversion of previous changes. The `common` package import was re-added, restoring the use of centralized directory path constants. The `ErrFailedToRecover` constant and the `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were re-introduced, indicating a more comprehensive error recovery strategy was being implemented. `SetupOnMount` was further refined with a `switch` statement for clearer differentiation between global and filesystem-specific setup. The error handling within `EncryptTargetDirs` was enhanced to explicitly handle `ErrFailedToRelocate` and imply more robust recovery logic.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:27 PM - 4:11 PM**: Initial commit and functional implementation across `common`, `integrity`, `main`, and `fscrypt` packages.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A notable refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, temporarily removing the `common` dependency and altering error handling. This marks an iterative development stage.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37 PM - 4:39 PM**: A period of significant refinement, particularly in `fscrypt.go` (re-adding `common` import, refining error recovery) and `integrity.go` (centralizing permissions, enhancing migration checks). These changes represent a more mature and robust design for the application's core functions.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   **Copyright Notices**: All Go files include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Focus on Integrity and Security**: The entire codebase is designed around ensuring system integrity, involving checks for root privileges, kernel versions, filesystem encryption support, and TPM initialization for key management.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling**: There's a consistent and evolving pattern of defining specific error types (e.g., `ErrIntegrityCompromised`, various `ErrFailedTo...`) and using structured `EncryptionResult` objects to detail outcomes, demonstrating a commitment to robust error reporting and recovery.

**File Path: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
*   **Timestamp of Significant Change:** 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM.
*   **Summary:** This file defines constant strings for crucial directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, and paths for migration, recovery, and manifests within `/opt/128technology/integrity/`. The only code change was an update to a package-level comment, clarifying its role as holding "common globals" for the Integrity Handler.

**File Path: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
*   **Timestamps of Significant Changes:** 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM (initial content shown) and 12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM.
*   **Summary:** This file implements the core logic for the Integrity Handler application, including environment verification, enabling encryption, and unlocking encrypted directories.
    *   **Initial state (11/21):** Defined functions to `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root user, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command presence, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (handling FEMK creation, fscrypt setup, and target directory encryption), and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. Helper functions like `getFsKey` and `ensureDirectoriesExist` were also present, the latter managing directory creation, cleaning the migration path, and establishing initial permissions. A `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was included to check for recovery data.
    *   **Later updates (12/1):**
        *   The `os` package was removed from imports, and directory permissions in `ensureDirectoriesExist` were updated to use constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`), implying these permissions were moved to the `common` package.
        *   The logic for cleaning the migration directory and creating the recovery directory was removed from `ensureDirectoriesExist`. A `TODO` comment suggested these directories should be managed during installation.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was added to explicitly check for and report existing contents in the migration directory, preventing data loss.
        *   Error handling for the "fscrypt command not found" check in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was changed from immediately returning an error to logging a warning, allowing other initialization steps to proceed.
        *   A minor syntactic change (from `var errs []error = ...` to `errs := ...`) occurred at 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM.
    *   Multiple entries between 11/21 and 12/1 for this file showed identical content, suggesting no functional changes in those specific commits.

**File Path: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
*   **Timestamp of Significant Change:** 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM.
*   **Summary:** This file defines the entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It includes `ExitCode` constants aligning with systemd service return values, embeds the application's version, parses a command-line `mount` flag, and orchestrates the primary workflow by calling environment verification, recovery checks, and integrity enabling/unlocking functions. It implements robust error handling to exit with specific codes based on success, environment incompatibility, or integrity compromises.

**File Path: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
*   **Timestamps of Significant Changes:** 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM (initial content shown), 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM, and 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM.
*   **Summary:** This package provides Go wrappers for `fscrypt` operations, facilitating directory encryption and management.
    *   **Initial state (11/21):** Defined various error constants related to fscrypt operations (e.g., relocation, encryption failures). Implemented `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem fscrypt setup and an `EncryptionResult` struct to categorize the outcomes of encryption attempts. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function managed the process of relocating contents, creating an empty target, encrypting it, and handling errors.
    *   **Mid-period update (11/25):** The `common` package import was temporarily removed, leading to hardcoded migration paths. The `EncryptionResult` struct and its related methods (e.g., `Failed`, `BuildError`) were modified to *remove* the `FailedToRecover` error category. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's error handling was refined using a `switch` statement for specific error types returned by `encryptTargetDir`.
    *   **Later updates (12/1):**
        *   The `common` package import was **re-added**, addressing the hardcoded path issue and allowing the use of `common` constants for directory paths.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated methods were **restored** to include `FailedToRecover` error tracking, reversing the change from 11/25. `ErrFailedToRecover` was also formally re-declared.
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function was significantly refactored to use a `switch` statement, clearly distinguishing between global fscrypt setup (for empty or root mount paths) and specific filesystem setup, enhancing flexibility for various deployment and upgrade scenarios.
        *   The error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` for `ErrFailedToRelocate` was enhanced to initiate a `recoveryErr` attempt.
    *   Several entries on 12/1 show identical content, suggesting minor, non-functional commits.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Security Focus:** A strong emphasis on integrity and encryption, utilizing TPM and fscrypt for key management (`FEMK`) and filesystem encryption.
*   **Directory Path Management:** Consistent use of dedicated directories for application files, migration data, recovery, and manifests, with evolving strategies for their creation and cleanup.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Extensive use of Go's `errors.Join` and error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`) for detailed error reporting and propagation. Custom error types are common to delineate specific failure conditions. Logging (`log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warn`, `log.Error`) is consistently used for internal state and issues.
*   **Idempotency:** Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent, crucial for reliable system operations.
*   **External Dependencies:** Heavy reliance on `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption mechanics and `github.com/spf13/afero` for abstract filesystem operations.
*   **Code Refinement:** The changes, especially in `fscrypt.go` and `integrity.go`, show a clear pattern of iterative refinement, including re-introducing previously removed error tracking and restructuring logic for better clarity and resilience. There's also a brief "regression-and-fix" cycle concerning the `common` import in `fscrypt.go`.

## 5:27:00 AM
The provided logs detail changes across several Go source files primarily focused on an "Integrity Handler" application, which manages filesystem encryption and integrity using `fscrypt` and a TPM.

**File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defines constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `BootDirPath`, `EncryptedKeyPath`, `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`. The package comment indicates its role in holding secure keys and common variables.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated from describing the secure container mechanism to a more general "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The directory path constants themselves remained unchanged in this update.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** (and subsequent entries at 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM with no visible changes): This file contains core logic for the Integrity Handler. Key functions include:
    *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt.CheckSupport`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization (`tpm.InitializeTPM`).
    *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving encryption keys (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories.
    *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories.
    *   `getFsKey`: Manages the secure loading and wiping of the filesystem encryption key.
    *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates application-specific directories with predefined permissions, including initial logic to clean the migration directory.
    *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks the recovery directory for any orphaned contents and logs warnings.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: *This log entry's content is for a `main.go` file, despite the filepath indicating `integrity.go`.* It introduces the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines `ExitCode` constants for different program termination states (success, generic failure, incompatible environment, integrity compromised). The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path flag, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the application's lifecycle, including version logging, environment verification, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, handling various error conditions, and returning appropriate exit codes.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Significant refactoring occurred:
    *   The `os` package import was removed, suggesting fewer direct OS interactions in this file.
    *   In `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, the check for the `fscrypt` command changed from returning a fatal error if not found to logging an error and continuing, making the absence of `fscrypt` a warning instead of a blocker for environment initialization.
    *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was simplified: it now uses directory permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) instead of hardcoded `os.FileMode` values, and the logic to clean the migration path was removed. The creation of `common.RecoveryDirPath` was also removed.
    *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was renamed to `checkMigrationDirectory` and its logic fundamentally changed. It now specifically checks `common.MigrationDirPath` for *any* contents and returns an error if found, preventing potential data overwrites from previous failed migrations, rather than just warning about recovery directory contents.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM**: A minor stylistic change was made in `checkMigrationDirectory`, updating the declaration of the `errs` slice.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**

*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error constants for various failure scenarios during encryption, such as `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, and `ErrEncryptionNotSupportedOnMount`. It includes `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific fscrypt configuration, an `EncryptionResult` struct to track outcomes, and `EncryptTargetDirs` which manages the process of relocating, encrypting, and restoring contents to target directories. The `encryptTargetDir` function was responsible for the core encryption process, moving files to a temporary directory before encrypting the target.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Significant modifications were made:
    *   The `common` package import was removed, indicating a temporary decoupling from shared constants, and explicit paths like `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"` were used instead.
    *   Error definitions were refined with new specific errors like `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`, and the `ErrFailedToRecover` field was removed from `EncryptionResult`.
    *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's internal flow changed, explicitly managing the `tempDir` and introducing a `switch` statement for detailed error handling after calling `encryptTargetDir`, including cleanup of `tempDir` on success.
    *   The signature and internal handling within `encryptTargetDir` were implied to have changed based on how it was called, removing the `recoveryDir` concept.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM** (and subsequent entries at 4:37:36 PM, 4:40:23 PM, 4:40:46 PM with no visible changes): This update reversed some previous changes and introduced new logic:
    *   The `common` package import was re-added, and `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-introduced, expanding the `EncryptionResult` struct and error handling logic to account for recovery failures.
    *   The `SetupOnMount` function was updated to use a `switch` statement, distinguishing between global (`""` or `"/"`) and filesystem-specific mount path setups.
    *   The call to `encryptTargetDir` within `EncryptTargetDirs` now expects `tempDir` to be returned, implying a significant change in `encryptTargetDir`'s signature and responsibility (though the snippet for `encryptTargetDir` itself does not reflect this implied signature change). The error handling `switch` in `EncryptTargetDirs` was further expanded to begin implementing detailed recovery strategies for `ErrFailedToRelocate`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Authorship**: All files consistently include the Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025.
*   **Security Focus**: The overall theme revolves around securing a system through filesystem encryption, evidenced by imports like `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault` (for secure key containers), and the frequent mentions of integrity and compromised states.
*   **Error Management**: There is a strong pattern of comprehensive error handling, with custom error types, explicit error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, `errors.Join`), and `errors.Is`/`errors.As` for specific error checking. This is indicative of a robust system designed to report and handle various failure modes.
*   **Directory-Based Operations**: The application heavily relies on predefined and managed directories for its operations, including dedicated paths for boot files, encrypted keys, migration data, recovery data, and manifest files. The evolution of directory permission handling and migration/recovery logic highlights its importance.
*   **Logging**: The consistent use of a custom `log` package (e.g., `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Error`, `log.Warn`) across all files for debugging, informational messages, and error reporting is a common pattern.
*   **Idempotency**: Explicit comments and design indicate efforts to make key operations, such as `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, idempotent to ensure consistent behavior across multiple runs.
*   **"TODO" Comments**: Several `TODO` comments are present, indicating areas for future work, such as better shredding for migration paths, incorporating main path into recovery, and improving installation-time directory creation and permissions.

    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM & 4:02:40 PM**
    *   **Updates:** The file initially defined constants for key directory paths, including `BootDirPath`, `EncryptedKeyPath`, `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`. The only recorded change was a minor update to the package-level comment at 4:02:40 PM, clarifying its purpose. No functional changes to the directory paths themselves were observed.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025 (multiple entries) & 12/1/2025 (multiple entries)**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM):** This file contained the main logic for `Integrity Handler`. Key functions included `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root, kernel, fscrypt, TPM), `enableIntegrity` (orchestrating directory setup, FEMK creation/retrieval, fscrypt setup, and encryption), `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getFsKey` (for secure key handling), `ensureDirectoriesExist` (creating and initially cleaning migration/recovery directories), and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`.
    *   **Repeated Entries (until 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM):** No code changes were evident in the log for these timestamps.
    *   **Major Refactor (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM):** This was a significant update:
        *   The `os` package import was removed.
        *   Error handling for a missing `fscrypt` command in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` changed from returning an error to merely logging a warning, potentially allowing the process to continue.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was heavily modified: it no longer hardcoded directory permissions but started relying on `common` package constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`), removed the logic for cleaning `MigrationDirPath` contents, and stopped creating `RecoveryDirPath`. A `TODO` comment suggested these directories should be created during installation.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was entirely removed.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced. This function checks for any existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath` and returns a composite error if found, indicating that manual intervention is needed to prevent data loss.
    *   **Minor Update (12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM):** A cosmetic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` for declaring an error slice (`var errs []error = ...` to `errs := ...`).

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**
    *   **Updates:** This file was introduced as the application's entry point. It sets up logging, parses command-line flags (specifically a `mount` path), and defines custom `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for structured program termination. The `run` function orchestrates calls to `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, handling their return values to determine the final exit code. It also uses Go's `_ embed` feature for versioning.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM & 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM & 12/1/2025 (multiple entries)**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** Provided high-level wrappers around fscrypt operations. It defined numerous specific error types, a `protectorName` constant ("FEMK"), `SetupOnMount` for global/filesystem fscrypt setup, and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track encryption outcomes (including `FailedToRecover`). The `encryptTargetDir` function contained logic for relocating directory contents, encrypting the empty directory, and restoring content, making use of `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath`.
    *   **Major Refactor (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
        *   The import for `common` package was *removed*, leading to hardcoded temporary directory paths within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was modified to *remove* the `FailedToRecover` field.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature changed, and its internal recovery logic (moving to a recovery directory) was removed, shifting error handling responsibility to the caller (`EncryptTargetDirs`).
    *   **Partial Reversion/Refinement (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM):**
        *   The `common` package import was **re-added**, restoring access to shared directory constants.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error variable was **re-declared**, suggesting a re-emphasis on recovery states, though the `EncryptionResult` struct *still lacked* the `FailedToRecover` field, indicating an ongoing inconsistency or development.
        *   `SetupOnMount` was updated for more granular handling of global versus specific filesystem setup.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` began re-incorporating recovery-like logic in its error handling, particularly for `ErrFailedToRelocate`.
    *   **Repeated Entries (until 12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM):** No code changes were evident in the log for these timestamps.

## 7:26:56 AM
The provided log details development changes for an "Integrity Handler" Go application, primarily focusing on filesystem encryption, secure key management, and directory operations between November 21, 2025, and December 1, 2025.

**Key Information:**

The project is concerned with maintaining system integrity, particularly through filesystem encryption managed by `fscrypt`, utilizing TPM/vTPM for key handling, and managing specific directory paths for operational data, migration, and recovery. All files are copyrighted by Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Introduced constants defining critical directory paths: `/boot/integrity` for boot files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted FEMK (File Encryption Master Key), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` for migration data, recovery data, and integrity manifests, respectively.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor documentation update changed the package description from "secure container" to "common globals" without affecting code functionality.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Multiple timestamps on 11/21/2025 (2:27:15 PM, 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM)**: These entries show no functional changes in the code.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM (and subsequent minor syntax updates at 4:39:02 PM, 4:39:52 PM, 4:41:11 PM, 4:42:37 PM)**:
        *   **Directory Setup Refinement**: The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was streamlined, removing manual cleaning of migration paths and the creation of recovery directories. It now relies on new common package constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) for directory permissions, implying related changes in `common/directories.go` not fully shown here.
        *   **Recovery Directory Handling Shift**: The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed. A new `checkMigrationDirectory` function was introduced to explicitly verify if `common.MigrationDirPath` is empty, returning an error if any contents are found to prevent overwriting past recovery data.
        *   **Fscrypt Command Check**: In `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, the check for the `fscrypt` command was altered. Instead of returning a fatal error if `fscrypt` is not found, it now logs an error message, allowing the program to continue execution.
        *   A minor change in `checkMigrationDirectory` at `12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM` from `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the first recorded entry for the `main` package, which serves as the Integrity Handler's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants for standardized process returns, parses a `--mount` command-line argument, sets up logging, and orchestrates the primary application flow, including environment verification, directory setup, integrity enablement, and unlocking encrypted directories. It also embeds the application's version string.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of high-level wrappers for `fscrypt`. It defines an `EncryptionResult` struct to detail the outcomes of encryption attempts and includes functions like `SetupOnMount` and `EncryptTargetDirs`. At this stage, `ErrFailedToRecover` is mentioned in comments and the `EncryptionResult` struct but not defined as an explicit `var` error.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**:
        *   **Error Definition Expansion**: Explicit `var` definitions for `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, and `ErrFailedToRestore` were added. `FailedToRecover` was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct, and the `common` import was temporarily removed.
        *   **Encryption Logic Refactoring**: The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was refactored. The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature changed to return an error, and `EncryptTargetDirs` now uses a `switch` statement to categorize and handle different encryption failure types.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM (and subsequent identical entries at 4:37:36 PM, 4:40:23 PM, 4:40:46 PM)**:
        *   **Re-introduction of `common` package**: The `common` import was restored.
        *   **`SetupOnMount` Enhancements**: The `SetupOnMount` function was further refined with a `switch` statement to handle global (`""` or `"/"`) and specific mount point setups, including comments related to upgrade scenarios.
        *   **`ErrFailedToRecover` Re-added**: The `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant was reintroduced as an explicit `var` error, but `FailedToRecover` remains absent from the `EncryptionResult` struct, indicating a potential mismatch between error definition and reporting structure.
        *   **`EncryptTargetDirs` Updates**: The error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated, particularly for `ErrFailedToRelocate`, with comments about attempting recovery.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security-Centric Development**: The consistent use of "Integrity Handler," references to "encrypted FEMK," "TPM/vTPM," and specific error types like `errIntegrityCompromised` underline a primary focus on system security and data integrity.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: The code base demonstrates a comprehensive approach to error handling, with numerous specific error types and the `EncryptionResult` struct designed to provide detailed feedback on operational outcomes. The use of `errors.Join` indicates an intent to aggregate multiple errors.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are noted as requiring idempotency, highlighting a design principle for reliability and consistent behavior even when executed multiple times.
*   **Standardized Directory Structure**: The use of predefined constants for paths like `/boot/integrity` and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` shows a structured approach to managing application-specific directories.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `afero.Fs` interface is consistently used for filesystem operations, which aids in testing and potentially in supporting various underlying storage mechanisms.
*   **Ongoing Development**: Numerous "TODO" comments indicate areas for future improvements, such as idempotent flow refinements, secure data shredding, and integrating path management for upgrades.
*   **Version Control and Copyright**: All files include clear copyright notices from Juniper Networks, Inc., and the `main.go` file explicitly manages an application version, indicating a mature software development practice.

## 8:26:55 AM
The log details code changes for an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM for key management. The project maintains a consistent Juniper Networks copyright.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initially defines constants for critical directory paths like `/boot/integrity` (BootDirPath), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (EncryptedKeyPath), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (MigrationDirPath), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (RecoveryDirPath), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (ManifestDirPath). The package comment mentions a secure container for keys.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor, non-functional change occurred where the package comment was rephrased for clarity; the directory constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: Multiple entries show no functional code changes during this period. The initial code established core functions: `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` to check system requirements (root, kernel version, fscrypt support, TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` to set up encryption, `unlockEncryptedDirs` for unlocking, and `getFsKey` for lazy-loading keys. It included `ensureDirectoriesExist` to create necessary directories with specific permissions and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to check for recovery data.
    *   **Timestamps: 12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A major refactoring occurred across these entries:
        *   Error handling for `fscrypt` command not found was altered from a hard failure to logging an error and continuing execution.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was significantly revised. It removed internal permission declarations (`var perms os.FileMode`) and the explicit logic for cleaning `MigrationDirPath` and creating `RecoveryDirPath`. It now relies on `common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, and `common.BootDirPerms` (implying new constants in the `common` package) for permissions. A TODO comment indicates that these directories should ideally be created during installation.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced. This function explicitly checks if the `common.MigrationDirPath` contains any files and returns an error if it does, aiming to prevent overwriting existing migration or recovery data.
        *   A minor stylistic change was made in the `checkMigrationDirectory` function from `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file defines the main application entry point. It handles command-line arguments (e.g., `mountPath`), sets logging levels, embeds a version string, and orchestrates the calls to `integrity.go`'s functions (`handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`). It defines custom `ExitCode` constants to indicate different application outcomes (success, generic failure, incompatible environment, integrity compromised).

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: The initial version defined numerous `Err` constants for various encryption-related failures. It contained `SetupOnMount` for fscrypt initialization, an `EncryptionResult` struct to track encryption outcomes, and `EncryptTargetDirs` to manage the encryption process, which included relocating directory contents, creating empty encrypted directories, and moving data back. This initial version implicitly used `common.MigrationDirPath`.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A significant architectural change occurred. The import of `"common"` was removed, leading to hardcoded temporary directory paths (e.g., `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`). New, more specific `Err` constants like `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were added, while the `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct. The error handling within `EncryptTargetDirs` was restructured to use a `switch` statement based on returned errors.
    *   **Timestamps: 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM**: These entries show further evolution and partial reversion/refinement from the 11/25 changes. The `"common"` package import was restored, allowing for consistent path management. The `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant was re-introduced (though notably, the `EncryptionResult` struct definition in these logs still does *not* include a `FailedToRecover` field, indicating a potential inconsistency). The `SetupOnMount` function was redesigned to use a `switch` statement for more explicit global vs. specific mount path setup. `EncryptTargetDirs` was adjusted to expect the `encryptTargetDir` function to return the `tempDir` path. Multiple commits within a short timeframe indicate continuous refinement or minor adjustments to the error handling and setup logic, without major functional shifts between them.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Ownership**: All files are consistently copyrighted by "Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved."
*   **Integrity and Encryption**: The codebase is dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" application, heavily utilizing `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption and TPM for managing encryption keys (FEMK - File Encryption Master Key).
*   **Error Handling**: A robust error handling strategy is evident, with numerous custom error types, extensive use of `errors.Join`, and specific error logging (e.g., `log.Errorf`, `log.Warnf`). The application distinguishes between various failure modes during encryption and recovery processes.
*   **Directory Management**: Specific directory paths are defined in `common/directories.go` for `/boot/integrity`, migration, recovery, and manifests. Functions like `ensureDirectoriesExist` and `checkMigrationDirectory` are central to managing these paths, emphasizing careful handling of temporary and recovery data.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly noted as requiring idempotency, ensuring consistent behavior across multiple executions.
*   **Logging**: The application extensively uses a custom `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) for detailed output at different levels (Debug, Info, Error, Warn).
*   **Third-Party Libraries**: Consistent use of `github.com/google/fscrypt`, `github.com/spf13/afero` (filesystem abstraction), and `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` is observed across multiple files.
*   **Future-dated Timestamps**: All timestamps are in late 2025, suggesting this is development work planned for a future release.

## 9:26:56 AM
The changes log details the evolution of the "Integrity Handler" Go application, focusing on file system encryption, secure key management, and directory handling.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **November 21, 2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Defined several constant directory paths central to the Integrity Handler's operation, including `/boot/integrity` for boot-time files and encrypted keys, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` for migration data, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` for failure recovery, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` for integrity manifests.
    *   **November 21, 2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update changed the package comment from detailing secure container implementation to a more general description of "common globals." The defined directory paths remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **November 21, 2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM**: Initial implementation and subsequent minor changes. This file contains the core logic for verifying the environment (root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, TPM initialization), enabling and unlocking encrypted directories, and managing the FEMK (File Encryption Master Key) securely. The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was responsible for creating necessary directories and cleaning the migration path, while `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` logged warnings for existing recovery data.
    *   **December 1, 2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This marked a significant refactoring.
        *   The `os` import was removed, indicating reduced direct OS interaction in favor of the `afero` abstraction.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was streamlined. It stopped defining explicit file permissions (now relying on `common` constants, implying `common/directories.go` would define these permissions, although not shown in its own log entries for this timestamp). Crucially, it removed the logic for creating `RecoveryDirPath` and for cleaning contents from `MigrationDirPath`.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was renamed to `checkMigrationDirectory`. Its functionality shifted from merely *warning* about recovery directory contents to *erroring out* if `MigrationDirPath` contains any files, preventing accidental overwriting during subsequent operations.
        *   Error handling for `exec.LookPath("fscrypt")` changed from returning a fatal error to just logging a warning, suggesting a change in criticality or how this dependency is managed.
    *   **December 1, 2025, 4:39:02 PM - 4:42:37 PM**: Minor re-saves or cosmetic changes, including a syntax simplification in `checkMigrationDirectory` for slice initialization (`var errs []error = ...` to `errs := ...`). No functional changes were observed after the major refactoring at 4:38:57 PM.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **November 21, 2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduced the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines standard `ExitCode` values, embeds the application version, parses a `mount` path argument, and orchestrates the calls to `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings()`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment()`, `enableIntegrity()`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs()`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **November 21, 2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation providing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined various error types related to encryption and migration, implemented `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific fscrypt setup, and introduced `EncryptionResult` to track the outcomes of directory encryption. The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions contained logic for moving data, encrypting directories, and basic recovery. This version directly imported `common` for directory paths.
    *   **November 25, 2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A significant architectural change occurred.
        *   New explicit error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`, `ErrFailedToRecover`) were added.
        *   The `FailedToRecover` field was temporarily removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct, and related error building logic was adjusted.
        *   The `common` package import was removed, leading to hardcoded paths (e.g., `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`) within the `EncryptTargetDirs` function.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function signature changed to return `(tempDir string, err error)` instead of taking `recoveryDir` and `result` directly, shifting recovery responsibility to the caller (`EncryptTargetDirs`). The recovery logic within `encryptTargetDir` itself was removed or commented out.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function adopted a `switch` statement for specific error handling and initiated cleanup of temporary directories on success.
    *   **December 1, 2025, 4:37:06 PM**: This update largely reverted the changes from November 25 regarding package imports and error tracking.
        *   The `common` package import was restored, resolving the hardcoded path issue.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant and the `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were re-added.
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function was refactored with a `switch` statement to differentiate global setup from filesystem-specific setup (e.g., for upgrades).
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to process `tempDir` returned by `encryptTargetDir` and introduced a `recoveryErr` variable within its expanded error-handling `switch` statement, indicating a more sophisticated recovery flow.
    *   **December 1, 2025, 4:37:36 PM - 4:40:46 PM**: Subsequent re-saves without discernible functional code changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All files consistently include the `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` notice.
*   **Integrity Handler Focus**: The codebase revolves around the "Integrity Handler" application, designed for secure filesystem management, particularly encryption using `fscrypt`.
*   **Security-Oriented Operations**: Key elements include:
    *   Environment checks (root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support).
    *   TPM/vTPM initialization for FEMK encryption.
    *   Use of a `vault.SecureContainer` and explicit memory wiping for sensitive keys.
    *   Emphasis on idempotency for critical functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`.
*   **Structured Error Handling**: The code heavily utilizes Go's `errors` package features (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`, `errors.Is`) to define, wrap, and handle specific error conditions. The `EncryptionResult` struct provides detailed status tracking.
*   **Directory Standardization**: A set of predefined directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, etc.) are consistently used across components for their designated purposes.
*   **Logging**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is widely used for debugging, informational messages, warnings, and error reporting.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: `github.com/spf13/afero` is used to abstract filesystem operations, facilitating testing and consistent behavior.
*   **Refactoring and Evolution**: The log shows a clear pattern of iterative development, particularly in the `fscrypt.go` and `integrity.go` files, where directory handling, error recovery, and the separation of concerns (e.g., between `common` package and hardcoded paths) undergo significant refactoring, suggesting an ongoing effort to improve robustness and design.

## 10:26:58 AM
The project's codebase demonstrates active development focused on an "Integrity Handler" application, likely related to secure filesystem management and encryption. Key changes and patterns revolve around directory management, robust error handling, and the integration of encryption technologies.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** This file was initially introduced defining several crucial directory paths as constants, including `BootDirPath`, `EncryptedKeyPath` (for a "FEMK" key), `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`. The package comment was slightly malformed, attempting to describe a "secure container" for keys.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** The package comment was clarified to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," improving readability and accuracy. No changes were made to the directory path constants themselves.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM:** Multiple logs show this file with largely identical content, suggesting minor re-saves or formatting changes that didn't alter the code logic significantly. This initial state included functions like `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (which creates FEMK, sets up `fscrypt`, and encrypts target directories), `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getFsKey` (lazy-loading the filesystem key from a secure container), `ensureDirectoriesExist` (with hardcoded permissions and cleanup logic for `MigrationDirPath`), and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM:** A substantial update occurred. The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was refactored to remove hardcoded directory permissions, now using constants like `common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, and `common.BootDirPerms` (implying corresponding updates in `directories.go` not explicitly shown in this log). The cleanup logic for `MigrationDirPath` was removed from `ensureDirectoriesExist`, as was the creation of `RecoveryDirPath`. The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was replaced by a new `checkMigrationDirectory` function, which now strictly errors if `MigrationDirPath` contains any files, preventing accidental data overwrites during migration attempts. The error handling for the `fscrypt` command lookup in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` changed from returning an error to merely logging it and proceeding.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM - 4:41:11 PM:** Further re-saves without discernible code changes.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM:** A minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` related to the initialization of an error slice (`var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)`).

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** This file was introduced as the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It defines standard `ExitCode` constants, embeds an application version, parses a `mount` path argument, and orchestrates the core integrity process: verifying the environment, handling recovery warnings, enabling integrity (encryption), and unlocking directories. It includes comprehensive error handling, mapping specific failures to distinct exit codes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** The initial version of this file provided high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` internals. It defined numerous error constants for various failure scenarios during encryption, a `protectorName` ("FEMK"), `SetupOnMount` for `fscrypt` initialization, and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track encryption outcomes. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function managed the encryption of multiple directories, with `encryptTargetDir` handling the relocation of contents, directory recreation, encryption, and restoration.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** Significant refactoring took place. More granular error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced. Critically, the `common` package import was *removed*, leading to the hardcoding of `tempDir` paths within the file. The `EncryptionResult` struct was modified, removing `FailedToRecover`. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to handle errors returned by `encryptTargetDir` using a `switch` statement and to clean up temporary directories on success. The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature changed to return an error, and its internal recovery logic was simplified.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM:** This update largely re-integrated elements removed in the previous change. The `common` package import was *re-added*, and `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-introduced into the error constants and the `EncryptionResult` struct. The `SetupOnMount` function was enhanced with a `switch` statement for more explicit handling of global vs. specific mount path setups. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function further refined its error handling `switch` statement, now including logic to attempt recovery for `ErrFailedToRelocate` scenarios. The `encryptTargetDir` function was updated to return both the `tempDir` and an error.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM - 4:40:46 PM:** Subsequent re-saves without discernible code changes.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright and Authorship:** All files consistently include a Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025, indicating a single organizational ownership and a futuristic timestamp, possibly for planned release or internal versioning.
*   **Integrity Handler Core Logic:** The entire log reflects the development of a security-focused application, "Integrity Handler," which leverages `fscrypt` for data encryption and TPM for key protection (FEMK - File Encryption Master Key).
*   **Structured Error Handling:** A clear evolution towards more specific and robust error handling is evident. This includes defining numerous custom error constants (`ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, etc.), using `errors.Join` for composite errors, and employing `switch` statements to manage different error outcomes. The `EncryptionResult` struct provides a detailed breakdown of successes and various failure types.
*   **Directory Management and Migration:** The application heavily relies on specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`). There's a continuous refinement of how these directories are created, permissions set, and how data is managed during encryption (e.g., relocating content to temporary directories). The changes to `checkMigrationDirectory` highlight a focus on preventing data loss during failed migration attempts.
*   **Idempotency as a Design Goal:** Comments explicitly state that core functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are designed to be idempotent, ensuring consistent behavior even if executed multiple times.
*   **Logging:** The consistent use of a custom `log` package (from `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) for various severity levels (Debug, Info, Warn, Error) is a recurring pattern for operational visibility.
*   **Development Cycle:** The timestamps suggest bursts of development activity, particularly around 11/21/2025 and 12/1/2025. The changes from 11/25/2025 to 12/1/2025 in `fscrypt.go` specifically show a pattern of initial refactoring (e.g., removing `common` import, simplifying recovery) followed by re-integration and further refinement (re-adding `common` and `ErrFailedToRecover`), indicating an iterative development process.
*   **`TODO` Comments:** Numerous "TODO" comments indicate areas planned for future development or refinement, such as improving shredding for temporary files, processing manifests, and streamlining directory creation during installation.

## 11:26:57 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go files within an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focused on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM integration. The project appears to be a security-sensitive component by Juniper Networks, Inc., copyrighted 2025.

**File-Specific Updates and Timestamps:**

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant paths for the Integrity Handler's critical directories, including `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files). The package comment describes its role in holding a secure key at runtime.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The directory path constants remain unchanged. The only update is a slight rephrasing of the package comment from detailing secure container reliance to a more general "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** (and identical subsequent logs at 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM): This file contains the core logic for the Integrity Handler application.
    *   It defines `errIntegrityCompromised` and functions for environment verification (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), enabling integrity (`enableIntegrity`), unlocking encrypted directories (`unlockEncryptedDirs`), and managing the filesystem key (`getFsKey`).
    *   Environment verification checks for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt/metadata.CheckSupport`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization (`tpm.InitializeTPM`).
    *   `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` are designed to be idempotent.
    *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` initially creates several operational directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) with specific permissions, including logic to clean the migration directory.
    *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` logs warnings if contents are found in the recovery directory.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM** (and identical subsequent logs at 4:39:02 PM, 4:39:52 PM, 4:41:11 PM, 4:42:37 PM): Significant refactoring occurred in this file:
    *   The `os` import was removed.
    *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was updated to use permission constants (`common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms`) from the `common` package, suggesting these constants were externalized.
    *   The previous logic within `ensureDirectoriesExist` for cleaning `MigrationDirPath` and creating `RecoveryDirPath` was removed.
    *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was completely removed.
    *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced. This function actively checks `common.MigrationDirPath` for any contents and returns an error if found, preventing overwrites of potential recovery data.
    *   A minor behavioral change: the `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` function's handling of `fscrypt` command not found changed from returning an error to logging an error and continuing execution, which could alter the application's failure behavior.
    *   A very minor syntax change in `checkMigrationDirectory` was noted at 4:42:37 PM (`var errs []error = make` to `errs := make`).

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the application's entry point.
    *   It parses a `--mount` flag (defaulting to "/").
    *   Defines `ExitCode` constants for different application termination states (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised).
    *   The `run` function orchestrates the Integrity Handler's flow: logs version, initializes application state, calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It specifically handles `errIntegrityCompromised` for `ExitCompromised`.
    *   It uses `DefaultManifest()` to obtain target directories for encryption, implying a manifest-driven configuration for integrity enforcement.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
    *   It defines numerous error constants related to fscrypt operations (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`).
    *   The `SetupOnMount` function initializes `fscrypt` globally or on a specific mount path.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the outcome of encryption attempts for multiple targets, categorizing them into `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, and various failure types.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` orchestrates the encryption of given target directories, calling `encryptTargetDir` for individual targets.
    *   `encryptTargetDir` involves relocating directory contents, recreating the target directory as empty, encrypting it, and then restoring contents.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This update involves substantial changes to the `fscrypt` implementation:
    *   The import of `common` package was temporarily removed.
    *   Error constants were modified, notably `ErrFailedToRecover` was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated methods (`Failed`, `BuildError`).
    *   The `encryptTargetDir` function signature changed to accept `tempDir` as an argument. The internal logic for handling temporary and recovery directories was refactored and is no longer fully shown in the log.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` now hardcodes the `tempDir` path locally and includes a detailed `switch` statement for handling various error types returned by `encryptTargetDir`, explicitly attempting to clean up the temporary directory on success.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM** (and identical subsequent logs at 4:37:36 PM, 4:40:23 PM, 4:40:46 PM): Further significant changes:
    *   The `common` package was re-imported.
    *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant and `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were re-added, indicating a re-introduction of explicit recovery error tracking.
    *   The `SetupOnMount` function was refactored to use a `switch` statement for global vs. filesystem-specific setup, with comments indicating different behaviors for initial setup vs. upgrade scenarios.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to reflect `encryptTargetDir` now returning the `tempDir` directly. The error handling `switch` statement was expanded for more robust recovery logic, particularly for `ErrFailedToRelocate`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Copyright and Licensing:** All Go files consistently include the `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` header.
2.  **Go Standard Library Usage:** Frequent use of `context`, `errors`, `fmt`, `os/exec`, and `path/filepath`.
3.  **Third-Party Libraries:** Consistent use of `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption, `github.com/spf13/afero` for abstracting filesystem operations (enhancing testability), and `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` for application logging.
4.  **Error Handling Patterns:**
    *   Extensive use of custom error variables (e.g., `errIntegrityCompromised`, various `ErrFailedTo...`).
    *   Robust error wrapping using `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)` for context.
    *   Conditional error handling with `errors.Is` and `errors.As` for specific error types, enabling granular recovery or logging.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct exemplifies a pattern for collecting and reporting multiple outcomes/failures from a batch operation.
5.  **Security Focus:** The codebase is heavily oriented towards filesystem integrity and encryption, utilizing TPM/vTPM, secure key containers (`vault.SecureContainer`), and fscrypt. The "integrity is compromised" error is a central concept.
6.  **Idempotency:** Explicit comments indicate that functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are designed to be idempotent, which is crucial for reliability in system-level operations where functions might be called multiple times.
7.  **Directory Management:** The application defines and manipulates specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, etc.) for its operation, encryption key storage, migration, recovery, and manifest files.
8.  **Logging Levels:** The use of `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warn`, `log.Error` indicates a detailed logging strategy for monitoring and debugging.
9.  **Iterative Development:** The multiple timestamps, especially in `integrity.go` and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, show a continuous development process with refactoring and adjustments to error handling and directory management strategies over time. There are several instances of immediate re-commits with identical content, suggesting frequent saving or minor, non-functional changes.
