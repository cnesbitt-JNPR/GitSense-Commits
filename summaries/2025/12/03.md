# Activity Summary for 12/3/2025

## 12:26:52 AM
The changes log details the development of a "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on filesystem encryption, key management, and directory integrity.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of key directory constants: `BootDirPath` (`/boot/integrity`), `EncryptedKeyPath` (`/boot/integrity/femk.enc`), `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath` (all under `/opt/128technology/integrity/`). The package comment had a minor grammatical error.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was corrected from "Package container common..." to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined directory paths remained unchanged.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This file, implementing the core Integrity Handler, was introduced. It includes functions for:
    *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt/metadata`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
    *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates directory creation, FEMK resolution, filesystem key retrieval, fscrypt setup, and target directory encryption.
    *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking encrypted directories.
    *   `getFsKey`: Manages the secure loading and wiping of the filesystem key.
    *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates the various integrity-related directories with specific permissions (e.g., `0o750`, `0o700`) and includes initial logic to clean the migration directory.
    *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if contents are found in the `RecoveryDirPath`.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**: No functional changes observed; likely a re-save or minor non-functional update.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM**: A minor change was made in `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to use a locally scoped `fs` variable instead of `afero.NewOsFs()` twice for an `Exists` check.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: In `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, the explicit `afero.Exists` check was removed, allowing the function to directly attempt reading the `RecoveryDirPath` and handling any error that might arise from its non-existence or inability to read.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Significant refactoring:
    *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was simplified. It now relies on permissions defined in the `common` package (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`), removing direct `os.FileMode` usage and the logic to clean `MigrationDirPath`. The creation of `RecoveryDirPath` was removed from this function.
    *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` was replaced by `checkMigrationDirectory`, which now specifically checks `common.MigrationDirPath` for any contents and returns an error if found, indicating that manual intervention is required to prevent data loss. This implies a change in the handling of recovery and migration state.
    *   The `os` import was removed as it was no longer directly used in `ensureDirectoriesExist`.
    *   The error handling for `exec.LookPath("fscrypt")` was changed from returning an error to just logging it, allowing the program to continue.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM**: No functional changes observed.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM**: A minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` from `var errs []error = make(...)` to `var errs []error := make(...)` for variable declaration, with no functional impact.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:41:11 PM** & **12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: No functional changes observed.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This new file was added, serving as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes, includes an embedded version string, and contains the `main` function. The `run` function orchestrates the initialization and integrity checks, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It also introduces a `DefaultManifest()` placeholder for targets.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file was added, providing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined numerous custom error types for various encryption and migration failures. Key functionalities include:
    *   `SetupOnMount`: Configures fscrypt globally or for a specific mount.
    *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct to track the success and various failure states of encryption operations on multiple target directories.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Encrypts target directories, moving existing contents out, encrypting the empty directory, and then moving contents back in. Includes initial error handling for relocation and encryption.
    *   It temporarily used constants from the `common` package for migration and recovery paths.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Substantial refactoring of error handling and the encryption flow:
    *   Explicit `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` errors were introduced.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and associated methods (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`) were updated to remove tracking for `FailedToRecover`, simplifying the immediate error reporting.
    *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was redesigned. It now calls `encryptTargetDir` and uses a `switch` statement to categorize and aggregate specific errors into the `EncryptionResult`. It also explicitly cleans up temporary directories on success.
    *   The `encryptTargetDir` function was refactored to take a `tempDir` and return a single error, allowing `EncryptTargetDirs` to manage the aggregation of results.
    *   The import of the `common` package was temporarily removed, with `common.MigrationDirPath` being hardcoded within `EncryptTargetDirs` as a `TODO`.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Further refinements to error handling and setup logic:
    *   `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-added to error constants and `EncryptionResult` struct, indicating a renewed focus on recovery mechanisms.
    *   `SetupOnMount` was enhanced with a `switch` statement to clearly differentiate between global fscrypt setup (for mount paths like `""` or `"/"`) and filesystem-specific setup (for other mount paths, typically during upgrades).
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` re-introduced the `common` package import, enabling dynamic use of `common.MigrationDirPath` again. The error handling `switch` statement was expanded to include `ErrFailedToRecover`, and `TODO` comments were added to highlight ongoing work on unwind steps and reporting partial successes/failures during recovery.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM**, **12/1/2025, 4:40:23 PM**, **12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM**: No functional changes observed.

**Overall Patterns:**
*   **Integrity Handler Application**: The code is part of an "Integrity Handler" application by Juniper Networks, Inc., copyrighted 2025.
*   **Filesystem Encryption**: The primary function is to implement and manage filesystem encryption using the `fscrypt` utility, relying on TPM for key protection.
*   **Directory-Based Operations**: Heavy emphasis on creating, managing, and cleaning specific directories for migration, recovery, and manifest storage.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: A consistent pattern of defining custom error types (`ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrIntegrityCompromised`, etc.) and using `errors.Join` for comprehensive error reporting is present across files. The `EncryptionResult` struct is central to aggregating outcomes of multi-target operations.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent.
*   **Ongoing Development**: Frequent `TODO` comments highlight areas for future improvements, particularly concerning error recovery, manifest processing, and ensuring correct directory permissions during installation.
*   **Chronological Development**: The timestamps show a concentrated period of development and refinement from late November to early December 2025, with frequent saves or minor commits.

## 12:38:05 AM
The provided log entry `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` contains SSH host keys, which are sensitive information. As per the instructions, a summary for file paths containing keys will not be generated.

## 1:26:57 AM
The code changes primarily focus on the development and refinement of an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, which aims to secure specific directories through filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and hardware-backed keys via TPM.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defines constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (`BootDirPath`), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (`EncryptedKeyPath` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (`MigrationDirPath`), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (`RecoveryDirPath`), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (`ManifestDirPath`). It clarifies that the package is for "common variables for Integrity Handler" and mentions a "secure container to hold our key at runtime".
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package-level comment was updated to a more concise "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." No functional code changes were made at this timestamp.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This is a core file for the Integrity Handler application. It includes functions to:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements such as root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`'s CheckSupport), presence of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, including ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving/creating a File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories. It is noted to be idempotent.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks previously encrypted directories using the FEMK.
        *   `getFsKey`: Lazy-loads and decrypts the FEMK from a secure container.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates the migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with specific permissions, and initially included logic to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for contents in the recovery directory.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: No functional code changes occurred in these three commits; the file content remained identical to the 2:27:15 PM version.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This timestamp marks significant refactoring:
        *   The `os` import was removed.
        *   The `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` function's error handling for `fscrypt` command not found changed from returning an error to logging a warning, potentially allowing the process to continue.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was heavily modified: it now uses directory permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) instead of hardcoded `os.FileMode` values. The logic to clean `MigrationDirPath` and create `RecoveryDirPath` was removed.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was entirely removed.
        *   A new `checkMigrationDirectory` function was added, which explicitly checks `common.MigrationDirPath` for contents and returns an error if any are found, preventing overwriting old recovery data.
        *   A `TODO` comment was added to `ensureDirectoriesExist` to suggest these directories should be created during installation.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:41:11 PM**: No functional code changes occurred in these three commits; the file content remained identical to the 4:38:57 PM version.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` from `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)` (short variable declaration).

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file defines the `main` entry point for the Integrity Handler. It includes:
        *   `ExitCode` constants to standardize process return values.
        *   An embedded version string (`integrity-handler.version`).
        *   The `main` function sets up logging, parses a `mountPath` flag, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application's lifecycle, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes error handling to return specific `ExitCode`s based on the type of failure (e.g., `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`). It notes a "Major TODO" for processing manifests.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This package provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error types (`ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, etc.) and a `protectorName` constant "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount` performs global and filesystem setup for `fscrypt`.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the success and various failure states (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, recover) for target directories.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` is the main entry for encrypting multiple targets, iterating and calling `encryptTargetDir` for each.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` outlines the detailed steps: migrating contents out, recreating the directory, encrypting, and handling partial failures. The `FailedToRecover` field and related logic were present.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Significant changes were introduced:
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and associated `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were modified to **remove** `FailedToRecover` tracking.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's internal call to `encryptTargetDir` and its error handling logic were refactored, switching to a `switch` statement for specific error types. A successful path was added to remove temporary migration directories.
        *   The import of `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` was **removed**, and a temporary hardcoded path for `tempDir` was introduced within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: This commit largely reverts/refines the previous changes:
        *   The import of `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` was **re-added**.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error and the `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were **re-added**. `Failed()` calculation was updated accordingly, but `BuildError()` did not re-add its message.
        *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored to use a `switch` statement, distinguishing between global setup (for zero-value or root mount path) and specific filesystem setup (for upgrades).
        *   The error handling within `EncryptTargetDirs` was further refined to handle `ErrFailedToRelocate` by attempting to move contents to a recovery directory.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:40:23 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM**: No functional code changes occurred in these three commits; the file content remained identical to the 4:37:06 PM version.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directories.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial implementation of core integrity handling logic.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of the main application entry point and command-line parsing.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of fscrypt integration and error tracking.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Refactoring of `fscrypt.go` including removal of `FailedToRecover` from `EncryptionResult` and changes in import statements and error handling logic.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Further significant refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, re-introducing `FailedToRecover`, re-adding the `common` import, and overhauling `SetupOnMount` and `EncryptTargetDirs` error handling.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Major changes in `integrity.go`, especially in directory management functions (`ensureDirectoriesExist` revised, `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` removed, `checkMigrationDirectory` added) and a change in `fscrypt` command lookup error severity.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Header:** All files consistently start with the Juniper Networks copyright notice from 2025.
*   **Integrity Handler Focus:** The entire codebase is dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" application, emphasizing secure management of filesystem encryption.
*   **`fscrypt` and TPM:** There's a strong recurring theme of utilizing `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption and interacting with TPM for key management, indicating a robust security posture.
*   **Error Management:** A comprehensive error handling strategy is in place, using custom error types, `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, and `errors.Join`, particularly visible in the `fscrypt` package's `EncryptionResult` which meticulously tracks various failure modes.
*   **Directory Constants:** The `common/directories.go` file consistently defines canonical paths for various operational and storage directories, promoting maintainability and consistency.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The use of `github.com/spf13/afero` throughout the code for filesystem operations suggests a design choice for testability and flexibility across different underlying filesystems.
*   **Idempotency:** The importance of idempotent operations (e.g., `enableIntegrity`, `EncryptTargetDirs`) is explicitly noted, which is crucial for reliability in system management tasks.
*   **Environment Validation:** Rigorous checks for system prerequisites (root user, kernel version, filesystem features) are performed early in the application's lifecycle.

## 1:38:06 AM
The provided log contains changes for a single file: `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`. This file contains SSH host keys, which are sensitive information. Per the instructions, content from file paths that may store keys will not be summarized. Therefore, no summary will be generated for the provided log entry.

## 2:27:01 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go source files belonging to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focused on filesystem encryption and integrity management using `fscrypt` and TPM. All entries share a `Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` header.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially defined, establishing constants for key directory paths such as `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`. The package comment described its role in holding secure keys and common variables.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated for clarity, changing from a description of key storage to a more general statement: "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The directory path constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM to 2:40:35 PM)**: Multiple timestamps show identical code, indicating the initial robust implementation of the `Integrity Handler`. Key functionalities included:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements (root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, fscrypt support, fscrypt command availability, TPM initialization).
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving a File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates specific directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) with initial permissions (0o750 or 0o700) and includes logic to clean the `MigrationDirPath`.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Warns if contents are found in the recovery directory.
    *   **Significant Refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM)**: This timestamp marks a substantial update, followed by minor stylistic changes in subsequent identical code blocks:
        *   The `os` import was removed.
        *   Error handling for `fscrypt` command not found in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` changed from returning an error to logging a warning.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was altered to use new permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms`) instead of hardcoded values, and the logic to clean the `MigrationDirPath` was removed, as was the creation of `common.RecoveryDirPath`.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was entirely replaced by a new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, which performs a stricter check on `MigrationDirPath` for any residual contents and returns an error if found, emphasizing manual intervention.
    *   **Minor Update (12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM)**: A minor stylistic change occurred in `checkMigrationDirectory`, changing `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file defines the main entry point (`func main`) for the Integrity Handler. It handles command-line argument parsing for a `mountPath`, sets logging levels, defines custom `ExitCode` constants (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitCompromised`), embeds an application version string, and orchestrates the core integrity process by calling functions like `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes detailed error handling to return appropriate exit codes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM)**: This file implemented high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined a comprehensive set of error variables and an `EncryptionResult` struct with a `FailedToRecover` field. The `SetupOnMount` function handled global or filesystem-specific fscrypt setup. `EncryptTargetDirs` used `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath` for temporary data during the encryption process, which involved moving contents out, encrypting the empty directory, and then moving contents back.
    *   **First Refinement (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM)**:
        *   The import of the `common` package was removed, suggesting an attempt to decouple `fscrypt` from `common`'s directory constants. Hardcoded paths were introduced for temporary directories.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error variable and the corresponding `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were removed, simplifying error tracking.
        *   `SetupOnMount` logic was refined for handling global vs. mounted filesystem setups.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to use a `switch` statement for categorized error handling, and `encryptTargetDir`'s signature changed to accept a `tempDir` argument and return an `error`.
    *   **Second Refinement / Partial Rollback (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM to 4:40:46 PM)**:
        *   The `common` package import was re-added, effectively rolling back the decoupling attempt.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error variable definition was re-introduced (though the `EncryptionResult` struct still appears to lack its `FailedToRecover` field, indicating a potential inconsistency or partial change).
        *   `SetupOnMount` was further refined to explicitly handle global setup for empty or root mount paths, and filesystem-specific setup for others.
        *   The error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` for `ErrFailedToRelocate` was expanded to include `recoveryErr` logic and calls to a `migrateToRecoveryDir` function (not fully shown but implied).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security Focus**: The codebase consistently deals with integrity and encryption, utilizing `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption and `tpm` for key management (FEMK). The "SecureContainer" for keys and explicit wiping of `plainKey` reinforce this.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly commented as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for consistent behavior on repeated calls.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Recovery**: There's a strong emphasis on detailed error classification (many `Err...` variables) and sophisticated recovery mechanisms. The evolution of directory checks and recovery logic (`handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to `checkMigrationDirectory`, and complex `switch` statements in `EncryptTargetDirs`) highlights an iterative effort to ensure data integrity even during failures.
*   **Directory Standardization**: Multiple directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, etc.) are defined and consistently referenced, indicating a structured approach to file placement for the Integrity Handler. Changes show a move towards centralizing their permissions in `common`.
*   **Consistent Logging**: The `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) is used uniformly across files for debug, info, warning, and error messages.
*   **Chronological Development**: The timestamps show a clear development process, starting with initial implementation (11/21/2025), a focused refinement on a specific package (`fscrypt.go` on 11/25/2025), and then a broader refactoring that touches multiple files and sometimes reverts previous decisions (12/1/2025).

## 2:38:11 AM
A log entry indicates an update to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` on 12/2/2025, 4:09:09 PM. Due to the policy of not summarizing files that may store keys, the specific content of this `known_hosts` file is not detailed.

## 3:26:58 AM
The log details development activity on a Go application named `IntegrityHandler`, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity management.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was introduced, defining constant paths for critical directories used by the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and encrypted FEMK) and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` (for migration, recovery, and manifest files). The package comment noted its role in secure key handling and common variables.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor cosmetic change updated the package-level comment to clarify its purpose as containing "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: The initial version of this core file was logged, containing functions for environment verification (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), enabling integrity (`enableIntegrity`), unlocking encrypted directories (`unlockEncryptedDirs`), managing filesystem keys (`getFsKey`), and ensuring directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`). It also included `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to check for unhandled recovery data.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM**: The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was slightly modified, removing an initial check for directory existence before attempting to read its contents.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This marked a significant refactoring:
        *   The `os` import was removed.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was streamlined, no longer attempting to clean the migration directory and now using permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) from the `common` package, implying these were moved there. The creation of `RecoveryDirPath` was removed, with a TODO indicating directory creation should be part of installation.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` was replaced by `checkMigrationDirectory`, which now strictly *errors* if the migration directory is not empty, preventing data overwrites from failed previous attempts.
        *   A change in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` downgraded the failure to find the `fscrypt` command from a fatal error to a logged warning.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` related to error slice initialization (`var errs []error = ...` to `errs := ...`).

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file defines the entry point for the Integrity Handler. It includes `ExitCode` definitions for various outcomes, parses a `--mount` flag, embeds a version string, and orchestrates calls to environment initialization, directory handling, encryption, and unlocking functions. It provides detailed error handling and logging to ensure the application exits with appropriate status codes.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: The initial version defined a suite of error types related to fscrypt operations (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`). It implemented `SetupOnMount` for fscrypt initialization and `EncryptTargetDirs` which manages the encryption and migration of directory contents, tracking success and failures in an `EncryptionResult` struct.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This update introduced several new error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`). The `common` package import was temporarily removed, and the `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions were refactored for improved error handling, changing how errors are categorized and reported within the `EncryptionResult`. `FailedToRecover` was temporarily removed from `EncryptionResult`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: A significant refinement occurred:
        *   The `common` package was re-imported, resolving the temporary hardcoding of paths.
        *   `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-added, along with `FailedToRecover` in the `EncryptionResult` struct, indicating a renewed focus on comprehensive recovery mechanisms.
        *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored using a `switch` statement to differentiate global fscrypt setup from mount-specific setup.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` further evolved its error handling, explicitly attempting to recover contents when `ErrFailedToRelocate` occurs, signaling a more robust and fault-tolerant encryption pipeline.
    *   **Timestamps: 12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM, 12/1/2025, 4:40:23 PM, 12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM**: These entries are identical to the 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM version, indicating minor saves or checks without functional changes.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All files begin with the `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` notice.
*   **Integrity Handler Focus**: All changes are related to the `IntegrityHandler` application, indicating a dedicated development effort on this component.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: The codebase consistently uses Go's `errors` package (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Is`, `errors.Join`) for detailed and categorized error reporting.
*   **Comprehensive Logging**: `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` is widely used for logging debug, info, warning, and error messages throughout the application, crucial for diagnostics.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is utilized for abstract filesystem operations, enhancing testability and flexibility.
*   **Fscrypt Integration**: The core functionality relies heavily on `github.com/google/fscrypt` for Linux filesystem encryption, highlighting its importance in securing directories.
*   **Secure Key Management**: References to `tpm.InitializeTPM` and `vault.SecureContainer` point to a strategy for securely managing encryption keys, likely involving a Trusted Platform Module.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly noted as designed to be idempotent, ensuring they can be safely rerun without unintended side effects.
*   **Migration and Recovery Logic**: The persistent use and evolution of `MigrationDirPath` and `RecoveryDirPath` (defined in `common/directories.go`) and associated handling functions (`checkMigrationDirectory`, error recovery logic in `fscrypt.go`) demonstrate a strong emphasis on maintaining data integrity and providing recovery options during critical encryption and migration processes.
*   **Development TODOs**: Numerous `TODO` comments are present, outlining future work, such as processing manifests, improving data shredding, and transitioning directory creation to installation-time.
*   **Development Sprints**: The timestamps reveal two main periods of active development: around November 21, 2025, and a concentrated effort around December 1, 2025, particularly on refining fscrypt integration and error recovery.
