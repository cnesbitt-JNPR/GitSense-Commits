# Activity Summary for 12/3/2025

## 12:26:52 AM
The changes log details the development of a "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on filesystem encryption, key management, and directory integrity.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of key directory constants: `BootDirPath` (`/boot/integrity`), `EncryptedKeyPath` (`/boot/integrity/femk.enc`), `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath` (all under `/opt/128technology/integrity/`). The package comment had a minor grammatical error.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was corrected from "Package container common..." to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined directory paths remained unchanged.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This file, implementing the core Integrity Handler, was introduced. It includes functions for:
    *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (using `fscrypt/metadata`), `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization.
    *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates directory creation, FEMK resolution, filesystem key retrieval, fscrypt setup, and target directory encryption.
    *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking encrypted directories.
    *   `getFsKey`: Manages the secure loading and wiping of the filesystem key.
    *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates the various integrity-related directories with specific permissions (e.g., `0o750`, `0o700`) and includes initial logic to clean the migration directory.
    *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if contents are found in the `RecoveryDirPath`.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM**: No functional changes observed; likely a re-save or minor non-functional update.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM**: A minor change was made in `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to use a locally scoped `fs` variable instead of `afero.NewOsFs()` twice for an `Exists` check.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: In `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, the explicit `afero.Exists` check was removed, allowing the function to directly attempt reading the `RecoveryDirPath` and handling any error that might arise from its non-existence or inability to read.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Significant refactoring:
    *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was simplified. It now relies on permissions defined in the `common` package (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`), removing direct `os.FileMode` usage and the logic to clean `MigrationDirPath`. The creation of `RecoveryDirPath` was removed from this function.
    *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` was replaced by `checkMigrationDirectory`, which now specifically checks `common.MigrationDirPath` for any contents and returns an error if found, indicating that manual intervention is required to prevent data loss. This implies a change in the handling of recovery and migration state.
    *   The `os` import was removed as it was no longer directly used in `ensureDirectoriesExist`.
    *   The error handling for `exec.LookPath("fscrypt")` was changed from returning an error to just logging it, allowing the program to continue.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM**: No functional changes observed.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM**: A minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` from `var errs []error = make(...)` to `var errs []error := make(...)` for variable declaration, with no functional impact.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:41:11 PM** & **12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: No functional changes observed.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This new file was added, serving as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes, includes an embedded version string, and contains the `main` function. The `run` function orchestrates the initialization and integrity checks, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It also introduces a `DefaultManifest()` placeholder for targets.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file was added, providing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined numerous custom error types for various encryption and migration failures. Key functionalities include:
    *   `SetupOnMount`: Configures fscrypt globally or for a specific mount.
    *   `EncryptionResult`: A struct to track the success and various failure states of encryption operations on multiple target directories.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Encrypts target directories, moving existing contents out, encrypting the empty directory, and then moving contents back in. Includes initial error handling for relocation and encryption.
    *   It temporarily used constants from the `common` package for migration and recovery paths.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Substantial refactoring of error handling and the encryption flow:
    *   Explicit `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` errors were introduced.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and associated methods (`newEncryptionResult`, `Failed`, `BuildError`) were updated to remove tracking for `FailedToRecover`, simplifying the immediate error reporting.
    *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was redesigned. It now calls `encryptTargetDir` and uses a `switch` statement to categorize and aggregate specific errors into the `EncryptionResult`. It also explicitly cleans up temporary directories on success.
    *   The `encryptTargetDir` function was refactored to take a `tempDir` and return a single error, allowing `EncryptTargetDirs` to manage the aggregation of results.
    *   The import of the `common` package was temporarily removed, with `common.MigrationDirPath` being hardcoded within `EncryptTargetDirs` as a `TODO`.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Further refinements to error handling and setup logic:
    *   `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-added to error constants and `EncryptionResult` struct, indicating a renewed focus on recovery mechanisms.
    *   `SetupOnMount` was enhanced with a `switch` statement to clearly differentiate between global fscrypt setup (for mount paths like `""` or `"/"`) and filesystem-specific setup (for other mount paths, typically during upgrades).
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` re-introduced the `common` package import, enabling dynamic use of `common.MigrationDirPath` again. The error handling `switch` statement was expanded to include `ErrFailedToRecover`, and `TODO` comments were added to highlight ongoing work on unwind steps and reporting partial successes/failures during recovery.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM**, **12/1/2025, 4:40:23 PM**, **12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM**: No functional changes observed.

**Overall Patterns:**
*   **Integrity Handler Application**: The code is part of an "Integrity Handler" application by Juniper Networks, Inc., copyrighted 2025.
*   **Filesystem Encryption**: The primary function is to implement and manage filesystem encryption using the `fscrypt` utility, relying on TPM for key protection.
*   **Directory-Based Operations**: Heavy emphasis on creating, managing, and cleaning specific directories for migration, recovery, and manifest storage.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: A consistent pattern of defining custom error types (`ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrIntegrityCompromised`, etc.) and using `errors.Join` for comprehensive error reporting is present across files. The `EncryptionResult` struct is central to aggregating outcomes of multi-target operations.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent.
*   **Ongoing Development**: Frequent `TODO` comments highlight areas for future improvements, particularly concerning error recovery, manifest processing, and ensuring correct directory permissions during installation.
*   **Chronological Development**: The timestamps show a concentrated period of development and refinement from late November to early December 2025, with frequent saves or minor commits.

## 12:38:05 AM
The provided log entry `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` contains SSH host keys, which are sensitive information. As per the instructions, a summary for file paths containing keys will not be generated.

## 1:26:57 AM
The code changes primarily focus on the development and refinement of an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, which aims to secure specific directories through filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and hardware-backed keys via TPM.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defines constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (`BootDirPath`), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (`EncryptedKeyPath` for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (`MigrationDirPath`), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (`RecoveryDirPath`), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (`ManifestDirPath`). It clarifies that the package is for "common variables for Integrity Handler" and mentions a "secure container to hold our key at runtime".
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package-level comment was updated to a more concise "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." No functional code changes were made at this timestamp.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This is a core file for the Integrity Handler application. It includes functions to:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements such as root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`'s CheckSupport), presence of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, including ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving/creating a File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories. It is noted to be idempotent.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks previously encrypted directories using the FEMK.
        *   `getFsKey`: Lazy-loads and decrypts the FEMK from a secure container.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates the migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with specific permissions, and initially included logic to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Checks for contents in the recovery directory.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: No functional code changes occurred in these three commits; the file content remained identical to the 2:27:15 PM version.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This timestamp marks significant refactoring:
        *   The `os` import was removed.
        *   The `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` function's error handling for `fscrypt` command not found changed from returning an error to logging a warning, potentially allowing the process to continue.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was heavily modified: it now uses directory permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) instead of hardcoded `os.FileMode` values. The logic to clean `MigrationDirPath` and create `RecoveryDirPath` was removed.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was entirely removed.
        *   A new `checkMigrationDirectory` function was added, which explicitly checks `common.MigrationDirPath` for contents and returns an error if any are found, preventing overwriting old recovery data.
        *   A `TODO` comment was added to `ensureDirectoriesExist` to suggest these directories should be created during installation.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:41:11 PM**: No functional code changes occurred in these three commits; the file content remained identical to the 4:38:57 PM version.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` from `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)` (short variable declaration).

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file defines the `main` entry point for the Integrity Handler. It includes:
        *   `ExitCode` constants to standardize process return values.
        *   An embedded version string (`integrity-handler.version`).
        *   The `main` function sets up logging, parses a `mountPath` flag, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application's lifecycle, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes error handling to return specific `ExitCode`s based on the type of failure (e.g., `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`). It notes a "Major TODO" for processing manifests.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This package provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error types (`ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, etc.) and a `protectorName` constant "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount` performs global and filesystem setup for `fscrypt`.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the success and various failure states (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, recover) for target directories.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` is the main entry for encrypting multiple targets, iterating and calling `encryptTargetDir` for each.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` outlines the detailed steps: migrating contents out, recreating the directory, encrypting, and handling partial failures. The `FailedToRecover` field and related logic were present.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Significant changes were introduced:
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and associated `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were modified to **remove** `FailedToRecover` tracking.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's internal call to `encryptTargetDir` and its error handling logic were refactored, switching to a `switch` statement for specific error types. A successful path was added to remove temporary migration directories.
        *   The import of `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` was **removed**, and a temporary hardcoded path for `tempDir` was introduced within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: This commit largely reverts/refines the previous changes:
        *   The import of `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` was **re-added**.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error and the `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were **re-added**. `Failed()` calculation was updated accordingly, but `BuildError()` did not re-add its message.
        *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored to use a `switch` statement, distinguishing between global setup (for zero-value or root mount path) and specific filesystem setup (for upgrades).
        *   The error handling within `EncryptTargetDirs` was further refined to handle `ErrFailedToRelocate` by attempting to move contents to a recovery directory.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:40:23 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM**: No functional code changes occurred in these three commits; the file content remained identical to the 4:37:06 PM version.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directories.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial implementation of core integrity handling logic.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of the main application entry point and command-line parsing.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of fscrypt integration and error tracking.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Refactoring of `fscrypt.go` including removal of `FailedToRecover` from `EncryptionResult` and changes in import statements and error handling logic.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Further significant refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, re-introducing `FailedToRecover`, re-adding the `common` import, and overhauling `SetupOnMount` and `EncryptTargetDirs` error handling.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Major changes in `integrity.go`, especially in directory management functions (`ensureDirectoriesExist` revised, `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` removed, `checkMigrationDirectory` added) and a change in `fscrypt` command lookup error severity.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Header:** All files consistently start with the Juniper Networks copyright notice from 2025.
*   **Integrity Handler Focus:** The entire codebase is dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" application, emphasizing secure management of filesystem encryption.
*   **`fscrypt` and TPM:** There's a strong recurring theme of utilizing `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption and interacting with TPM for key management, indicating a robust security posture.
*   **Error Management:** A comprehensive error handling strategy is in place, using custom error types, `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, and `errors.Join`, particularly visible in the `fscrypt` package's `EncryptionResult` which meticulously tracks various failure modes.
*   **Directory Constants:** The `common/directories.go` file consistently defines canonical paths for various operational and storage directories, promoting maintainability and consistency.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The use of `github.com/spf13/afero` throughout the code for filesystem operations suggests a design choice for testability and flexibility across different underlying filesystems.
*   **Idempotency:** The importance of idempotent operations (e.g., `enableIntegrity`, `EncryptTargetDirs`) is explicitly noted, which is crucial for reliability in system management tasks.
*   **Environment Validation:** Rigorous checks for system prerequisites (root user, kernel version, filesystem features) are performed early in the application's lifecycle.

## 1:38:06 AM
The provided log contains changes for a single file: `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`. This file contains SSH host keys, which are sensitive information. Per the instructions, content from file paths that may store keys will not be summarized. Therefore, no summary will be generated for the provided log entry.

## 2:27:01 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go source files belonging to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focused on filesystem encryption and integrity management using `fscrypt` and TPM. All entries share a `Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` header.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially defined, establishing constants for key directory paths such as `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`. The package comment described its role in holding secure keys and common variables.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated for clarity, changing from a description of key storage to a more general statement: "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The directory path constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM to 2:40:35 PM)**: Multiple timestamps show identical code, indicating the initial robust implementation of the `Integrity Handler`. Key functionalities included:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements (root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, fscrypt support, fscrypt command availability, TPM initialization).
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving a File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates specific directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) with initial permissions (0o750 or 0o700) and includes logic to clean the `MigrationDirPath`.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Warns if contents are found in the recovery directory.
    *   **Significant Refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM)**: This timestamp marks a substantial update, followed by minor stylistic changes in subsequent identical code blocks:
        *   The `os` import was removed.
        *   Error handling for `fscrypt` command not found in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` changed from returning an error to logging a warning.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was altered to use new permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms`) instead of hardcoded values, and the logic to clean the `MigrationDirPath` was removed, as was the creation of `common.RecoveryDirPath`.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was entirely replaced by a new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, which performs a stricter check on `MigrationDirPath` for any residual contents and returns an error if found, emphasizing manual intervention.
    *   **Minor Update (12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM)**: A minor stylistic change occurred in `checkMigrationDirectory`, changing `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file defines the main entry point (`func main`) for the Integrity Handler. It handles command-line argument parsing for a `mountPath`, sets logging levels, defines custom `ExitCode` constants (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitCompromised`), embeds an application version string, and orchestrates the core integrity process by calling functions like `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes detailed error handling to return appropriate exit codes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM)**: This file implemented high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined a comprehensive set of error variables and an `EncryptionResult` struct with a `FailedToRecover` field. The `SetupOnMount` function handled global or filesystem-specific fscrypt setup. `EncryptTargetDirs` used `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath` for temporary data during the encryption process, which involved moving contents out, encrypting the empty directory, and then moving contents back.
    *   **First Refinement (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM)**:
        *   The import of the `common` package was removed, suggesting an attempt to decouple `fscrypt` from `common`'s directory constants. Hardcoded paths were introduced for temporary directories.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error variable and the corresponding `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were removed, simplifying error tracking.
        *   `SetupOnMount` logic was refined for handling global vs. mounted filesystem setups.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to use a `switch` statement for categorized error handling, and `encryptTargetDir`'s signature changed to accept a `tempDir` argument and return an `error`.
    *   **Second Refinement / Partial Rollback (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM to 4:40:46 PM)**:
        *   The `common` package import was re-added, effectively rolling back the decoupling attempt.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error variable definition was re-introduced (though the `EncryptionResult` struct still appears to lack its `FailedToRecover` field, indicating a potential inconsistency or partial change).
        *   `SetupOnMount` was further refined to explicitly handle global setup for empty or root mount paths, and filesystem-specific setup for others.
        *   The error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` for `ErrFailedToRelocate` was expanded to include `recoveryErr` logic and calls to a `migrateToRecoveryDir` function (not fully shown but implied).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security Focus**: The codebase consistently deals with integrity and encryption, utilizing `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption and `tpm` for key management (FEMK). The "SecureContainer" for keys and explicit wiping of `plainKey` reinforce this.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly commented as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for consistent behavior on repeated calls.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Recovery**: There's a strong emphasis on detailed error classification (many `Err...` variables) and sophisticated recovery mechanisms. The evolution of directory checks and recovery logic (`handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to `checkMigrationDirectory`, and complex `switch` statements in `EncryptTargetDirs`) highlights an iterative effort to ensure data integrity even during failures.
*   **Directory Standardization**: Multiple directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, etc.) are defined and consistently referenced, indicating a structured approach to file placement for the Integrity Handler. Changes show a move towards centralizing their permissions in `common`.
*   **Consistent Logging**: The `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) is used uniformly across files for debug, info, warning, and error messages.
*   **Chronological Development**: The timestamps show a clear development process, starting with initial implementation (11/21/2025), a focused refinement on a specific package (`fscrypt.go` on 11/25/2025), and then a broader refactoring that touches multiple files and sometimes reverts previous decisions (12/1/2025).

## 2:38:11 AM
A log entry indicates an update to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` on 12/2/2025, 4:09:09 PM. Due to the policy of not summarizing files that may store keys, the specific content of this `known_hosts` file is not detailed.

## 3:26:58 AM
The log details development activity on a Go application named `IntegrityHandler`, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity management.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was introduced, defining constant paths for critical directories used by the Integrity Handler. These include `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and encrypted FEMK) and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` (for migration, recovery, and manifest files). The package comment noted its role in secure key handling and common variables.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor cosmetic change updated the package-level comment to clarify its purpose as containing "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: The initial version of this core file was logged, containing functions for environment verification (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), enabling integrity (`enableIntegrity`), unlocking encrypted directories (`unlockEncryptedDirs`), managing filesystem keys (`getFsKey`), and ensuring directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`). It also included `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to check for unhandled recovery data.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM**: The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was slightly modified, removing an initial check for directory existence before attempting to read its contents.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This marked a significant refactoring:
        *   The `os` import was removed.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was streamlined, no longer attempting to clean the migration directory and now using permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) from the `common` package, implying these were moved there. The creation of `RecoveryDirPath` was removed, with a TODO indicating directory creation should be part of installation.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` was replaced by `checkMigrationDirectory`, which now strictly *errors* if the migration directory is not empty, preventing data overwrites from failed previous attempts.
        *   A change in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` downgraded the failure to find the `fscrypt` command from a fatal error to a logged warning.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` related to error slice initialization (`var errs []error = ...` to `errs := ...`).

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**

The log details the evolution of a Go application named `IntegrityHandler`, developed by Juniper Networks in 2025, which focuses on filesystem integrity and encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** Defines core constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (BootDirPath), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (EncryptedKeyPath), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (MigrationDirPath), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (RecoveryDirPath), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (ManifestDirPath). These paths are crucial for storing application files, encrypted keys, migration data, and recovery information.
    *   **Minor Update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** A comment for the `common` package was rephrased for clarity, changing from "Package container common a secure container..." to "Package common contains common globals...". The directory constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial Core Logic (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM):** This file contains the primary logic for the `IntegrityHandler`. Key functions include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites such as root user, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata`), the presence of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the target mount, and initiating directory encryption.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Manages the lazy loading and secure handling (wiping after use) of the filesystem key.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates essential directories with specified permissions and initially included logic to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: A function to check for contents in the recovery directory.
    *   **Minor Iterations (11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM - 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM):** Multiple log entries show identical code, indicating non-functional saves or reformatting during development.
    *   **Significant Refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM):**
        *   The `os` package import was removed, implying `afero` or other library functions are now used for file mode operations.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was streamlined: it now utilizes permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) instead of hardcoded octal values for directory creation, and the logic to clean the migration directory and create the recovery directory was removed.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` was completely removed.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced. This function's purpose is to prevent overwriting previous recovery data by erroring if `common.MigrationDirPath` contains any files.
        *   The error handling for a missing `fscrypt` command in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was downgraded from a fatal error to a logged warning.
        *   A `TODO` comment was added, suggesting that critical directories should ideally be created during installation to reduce permission-related risks.
    *   **Minor Syntax Refinement (12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM):** A slight change in `checkMigrationDirectory` related to the syntax for initializing an error slice.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Introduced (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This file serves as the application's entry point. It sets up logging, parses command-line arguments (specifically a `mount` path), defines standard `ExitCode` constants (0 for success, 1 for generic failure, 6 for incompatible environment, 78 for integrity compromised), embeds a version string, and orchestrates the primary execution flow by calling `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Introduced (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file provides high-level Go wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error constants specific to encryption processes (e.g., `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`). Key components include:
        *   `protectorName`: A constant "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Configures `fscrypt` globally and on specific mount points.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: Tracks the outcomes (success, already encrypted, various failure modes like relocate, encrypt, unlock, restore, recover) of encryption operations.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Manages the encryption of target directories, involving moving contents out, encrypting the empty directory, and then moving contents back in.
    *   **Major Refactoring (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
        *   Temporarily removed the import of the `common` package.
        *   Introduced new, explicit error constants for `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was modified, removing the `FailedToRecover` field and updating associated methods (`Failed()`, `BuildError()`).
        *   `SetupOnMount`'s logic for global setup was adjusted.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` underwent significant changes, including the temporary use of a hardcoded path for migration storage instead of `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath`, and a revised error reporting mechanism using a `switch` statement for specific failure types.
    *   **Refinement and Partial Reversion (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM):**
        *   Re-introduced the `common` package import, correcting the previous refactor.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant was re-added, and the `EncryptionResult` struct along with `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated to include this recovery failure tracking again.
        *   `SetupOnMount` was further refined with a `switch` statement to clearly distinguish between global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup, particularly noting considerations for upgrades.
        *   The error handling within `EncryptTargetDirs` was expanded to include more robust recovery attempts, especially for `ErrFailedToRelocate` scenarios.
    *   **Minor Iterations (12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM):** Multiple log entries show identical code, indicating non-functional saves or reformatting.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security and Integrity Focus:** The overarching theme is the secure handling of filesystem encryption. This is evident through the use of `fscrypt`, TPM integration, and a `SecureContainer` for keys, all aimed at ensuring "Config Integrity."
*   **Error Management Sophistication:** A recurring pattern is the development of a detailed error reporting mechanism. Custom error types are extensively defined, and the `EncryptionResult` struct is used to provide a granular breakdown of outcomes (success, various failure types) for complex operations. The use of `errors.Join` demonstrates an intention to aggregate multiple errors.
*   **Directory-Centric Operations:** The code heavily relies on specific, well-defined directory paths for migration, recovery, manifests, and boot files. There is an ongoing refinement in how these directories are created, cleaned, and checked to ensure data safety and prevent overwrites.
*   **Idempotency as a Design Goal:** Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly marked with comments indicating they must be idempotent, suggesting that the application is designed to be safely run multiple times without unintended side effects.
*   **Copyright and Ownership:** All files consistently include a Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025.
*   **Modular Go Design:** The code is structured into logical Go packages (`common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`, `main`), promoting modularity and maintainability.
*   **Iterative Development:** The timestamps reveal distinct phases of development: initial setup (late November), a significant refactoring pass (late November/early December), and subsequent refinements and bug fixes (early December), often with rapid, non-functional saves interspersed.
*   **TODO Comments:** Numerous `TODO` comments are present, highlighting areas planned for future enhancements, such as better data shredding, improved context handling, manifest processing, and adjusting directory creation to the installation process.

    *   **December 1, 2025, 4:39:02 PM - 4:41:11 PM**: These entries show no visible changes from the previous one, likely re-saves.
    *   **December 1, 2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A minor stylistic change was made in `checkMigrationDirectory`, altering `var errs []error = make([]error, 0, len(contents))` to `errs := make([]error, 0, len(contents))`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **November 21, 2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This initial log entry for `main.go` sets up the application's entry point and overall flow:
        *   Defines custom `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) for standardized process return values.
        *   Embeds `integrity-handler.version` for version reporting.
        *   The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path flag, and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the Integrity Handler's execution, including version logging, `AppState` management, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` (which was later removed from `integrity.go`), `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes detailed error handling to return appropriate `ExitCode` values based on integrity status.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **November 21, 2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation providing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt`. It defines numerous error types related to fscrypt operations, the `protectorName` constant, `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem setup, and an `EncryptionResult` struct to detail the outcomes of encryption attempts. The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions outline the process of relocating, encrypting, and restoring directory contents. The log entry for this file is truncated.
    *   **November 25, 2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Significant modifications were made:
        *   The `common` package import was removed, leading to hardcoded paths like `"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"` being used instead of `common.MigrationDirPath`.
        *   New specific error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated to remove tracking for `FailedToRecover` and associated error messages.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's error handling for `encryptTargetDir` became more granular, using a `switch` statement for specific error types. It also added logic to remove temporary directories upon successful encryption.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function signature changed to accept `tempDir string` and return an error, indicating a shift in how its results are handled by the caller.
    *   **December 1, 2025, 4:37:06 PM**: This entry shows a partial revert and further refinement:
        *   The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` package import was restored.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error variable and its tracking in `EncryptionResult` (struct, `Failed()`, `BuildError()`) were re-introduced.
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function was substantially revised to use a `switch` statement for different `mountPath` scenarios, explicitly handling global setup for root/empty paths and assuming global setup is pre-existing for specific mount points during upgrades.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's error handling was further elaborated with a `case errors.Is(err, ErrFailedToRelocate)` block, hinting at more complex recovery logic being built into the higher-level encryption orchestrator.
    *   **December 1, 2025, 4:37:36 PM - 4:40:46 PM**: These entries show no visible changes from the previous one, likely re-saves.

    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defines `const` paths for Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (BootDirPath), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (EncryptedKeyPath), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (MigrationDirPath), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (RecoveryDirPath), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (ManifestDirPath). The package comment describes its role in holding secure keys and common variables.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated and simplified to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." No changes were made to the defined constants themselves.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** (and subsequent entries at 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM): This file contains core logic for environment verification, enabling/unlocking encryption. The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function created migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with specific hardcoded permissions, and attempted to clean the migration directory. A `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function logged warnings if the recovery directory contained items.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This marks a significant refactoring.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was modified: it no longer creates `RecoveryDirPath` or attempts to clean `MigrationDirPath`. Directory permissions are now derived from `common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, and `common.BootDirPerms` (implying new constants in the `common` package). A `TODO` comment indicates that these directories should ideally be created during installation.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced. This function checks for existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath` and returns an error if any are found, preventing overwriting of potential recovery data.
        *   Error handling for `exec.LookPath("fscrypt")` in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` changed from returning an error to logging it, suggesting a less critical failure path.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM** (and subsequent entries at 4:41:11 PM, 4:42:37 PM): Minor, syntactic changes were made within the `checkMigrationDirectory` function, likely due to Go formatting tools or linters, specifically adjusting how an error slice is initialized.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file, implementing the main application entry point, was introduced. It defines custom `ExitCode` values for success, generic failure, incompatibility, and integrity compromise. It embeds a version string, initializes logging, parses a `mountPath` flag, and orchestrates the calls to `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. Error handling includes specific exit codes for different types of failures, particularly `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations related to unlocking directories.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file defines high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations, including numerous error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`). It introduces an `EncryptionResult` struct to track the success and various failure modes of directory encryption. Functions like `SetupOnMount` and `EncryptTargetDirs` handle fscrypt setup and the complex process of moving directory contents, encrypting, and restoring them.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Significant changes were made to refine error handling and migration logic.
        *   The import of `common` was temporarily removed (indicating a shift in dependency or an oversight later corrected).
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was modified, removing `FailedToRecover` and adjusting the `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods accordingly.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions were refactored to handle different error conditions more explicitly using a `switch` statement for specific error types, and the `tempDir` management was adjusted.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: This update reinstated the `common` import.
        *   `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-added to the error variable list and the `EncryptionResult` struct, along with its inclusion in the `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods. This suggests a re-introduction or refinement of a specific recovery failure state.
        *   `SetupOnMount` was enhanced to use a `switch` statement, allowing for different setup logic based on the `mountPath` (global setup for `""` or `/`, or filesystem-specific setup for other paths).
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's error handling for `encryptTargetDir` was further refined to specifically address `ErrFailedToRelocate` with recovery attempts.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM**, **4:40:23 PM**, **4:40:46 PM**: These consecutive timestamps show no discernible functional or syntactic changes, likely indicating save points or minor formatting adjustments without semantic impact.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All files consistently include the Juniper Networks copyright for the year 2025, indicating a single ownership and development context.
*   **Logging**: The application heavily relies on `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` for detailed logging across debug, info, warn, and error levels, crucial for monitoring integrity and debugging issues.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: There's a strong emphasis on robust error handling, using `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`, and `errors.Is` to precisely categorize and manage errors, especially those related to integrity compromise or encryption failures. The `EncryptionResult` struct in `fscrypt.go` exemplifies this detailed error tracking.
*   **Filesystem Encryption with `fscrypt`**: The core functionality revolves around integrating with `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, utilizing TPM for key management (`FEMK`), and managing directories (`/boot/integrity`, migration/recovery paths).
*   **Idempotency**: The code explicitly states that key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` must be idempotent, reflecting a design goal for reliable, repeatable operations.
*   **`afero` for Filesystem Abstraction**: The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is consistently used for filesystem operations, which suggests an architectural decision for testability and potentially supporting different underlying file systems.
*   **Evolution of Directory and Error Management**: A clear pattern emerges in `integrity.go` and `fscrypt.go` regarding the continuous refinement of directory management (creation, permissions, cleanup) and error recovery strategies. This includes moving permission definitions, centralizing migration path checks, and iterating on the `EncryptionResult` structure to capture more nuanced failure states.
*   **Frequent Minor Commits**: Several files, particularly `integrity.go` and `fscrypt.go`, show multiple consecutive timestamps with identical or near-identical code content, suggesting a development pattern of frequent saves or minor, non-semantic changes (e.g., reformatting) being committed.

## 6:38:05 AM
The log contains changes to a `.ssh/known_hosts` file. Due to the sensitive nature of SSH host keys, the content of `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` will not be summarized. The file was last updated on 12/2/2025, 4:09:09 PM.

## 7:27:00 AM
The log captures changes to three Go source files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focused on file system encryption using `fscrypt` and secure key management.

**File-Specific Updates and Timestamps:**

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of constants for critical directory paths, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted FEMK), and migration/recovery/manifest directories under `/opt/128technology/integrity`. The package comment broadly described its purpose for secure key containers and common variables.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor, cosmetic change to the package-level comment, rephrasing "Package container common" to "Package common contains common globals" for better clarity. The defined directory constants remained unchanged.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial implementation of core integrity logic. This included functions for `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command availability, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (handling directory creation, FEMK resolution, fscrypt setup, and target encryption), and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It also contained `ensureDirectoriesExist` to create necessary paths and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to alert about existing recovery data.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM** to **11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: Multiple entries at these timestamps show no significant functional changes, appearing to be re-saves or minor undetectable modifications during a rapid development phase.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This timestamp marks a significant refactoring:
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was updated to use symbolic permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) instead of hardcoded octal values, implying these constants were introduced elsewhere (likely in `common/directories.go`, though not shown in this specific log). Crucially, the logic for cleaning the migration directory and creating the recovery directory was removed from this function.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed entirely.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced. This function now explicitly checks for and reports any existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath`, treating them as an error that requires manual intervention. This indicates a stricter approach to ensuring a clean state before a migration.
        *   Error handling for the `fscrypt` command being absent changed from an immediate fatal error to a logged warning, suggesting a potential change in its criticality for environment initialization.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM** to **12/1/2025, 4:41:11 PM**: Similar to earlier, these timestamps show no further functional changes.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A minor stylistic change was made in `checkMigrationDirectory`, changing `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)`.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file defines the entry point (`main` function) for the Integrity Handler. It includes custom exit codes (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) aligned with systemd standards. It orchestrates the primary workflow: version logging, initializing the application state, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It uses `//go:embed` for embedding a version string. This file's call to `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` would become inconsistent after its removal from `integrity.go` on 12/1/2025, implying a required subsequent update to `main.go` not present in this log.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial version, defining error constants specific to fscrypt operations. It included `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem fscrypt setup and `EncryptTargetDirs` for handling directory encryption and content migration. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracked various success/failure categories, including `FailedToRecover`.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Substantial changes to error handling and recovery:
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated methods (`Failed()`, `BuildError()`) were modified to remove explicit tracking of `FailedToRecover` errors.
        *   New, more specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was refactored to use a `switch` statement for more granular error handling from `encryptTargetDir` and included logic to remove temporary migration directories upon success.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature changed to return an `error`, and internal recovery/migration directory handling was altered, notably removing direct calls to `migrateToRecoveryDir`. A temporary hardcoded path replaced the `common` package constant for the migration directory.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: This update largely refined or reverted aspects of the 11/25 changes, showing an evolving recovery strategy:
        *   The import for the `common` package was re-added.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` constant and the `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` (along with its use in `Failed()` and `BuildError()`) were re-introduced.
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function was enhanced with a `switch` statement to better differentiate global versus specific filesystem fscrypt setup based on the mount path.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` further refined its error handling, now explicitly handling `ErrFailedToRelocate` with a recovery attempt.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM** to **12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM**: No further functional changes were observed in these entries.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All files consistently include the `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` header.
*   **Focus on Integrity and Encryption**: The codebase is entirely dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" application, emphasizing file system encryption using `fscrypt`, TPM integration for key protection, and robust error handling for integrity violations.
*   **Go Language Idioms**: Extensive use of `context.Context` for cancellation/timeout, `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)` for error wrapping, and `errors.Is`/`errors.As` for error type checking.
*   **Third-Party Libraries**: Consistent use of `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption, `github.com/spf13/afero` for abstract filesystem operations, and a local `log` package.
*   **Centralized Constants**: The `common/directories.go` file centralizes common path definitions, promoting consistency and maintainability across the application.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent, crucial for reliable system operations and recovery.
*   **Evolving Error and Recovery Strategies**: The changes in `fscrypt.go` and `integrity.go` between 11/25/2025 and 12/1/2025 demonstrate ongoing refinement of error reporting, classification, and implementation of recovery mechanisms for failed encryption or migration processes, particularly with the re-introduction and more detailed handling of `FailedToRecover` states.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: The presence of multiple entries for the same file within short timeframes (e.g., `integrity.go` on 11/21 and 12/1) suggests active development, testing, and minor adjustments or re-saves.

## 8:26:57 AM
The provided log details changes to a Go application named "Integrity Handler," focusing on secure filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM/vTPM.

**File-Specific Updates and Timestamps:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initially defines key directory paths as constants, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files).
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update changed the package comment from describing secure key containers to broadly stating it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM (and subsequent identical entries at 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM)**: Establishes core logic. This includes `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` for system checks (root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command availability, TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` to orchestrate encryption, `unlockEncryptedDirs` for unlocking, `getFsKey` for lazy-loading keys, and `ensureDirectoriesExist` to create necessary directories with specific permissions, including initial cleaning of the migration directory and logging warnings for the recovery directory.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Underwent significant changes:
        *   The `os` import was removed.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was refactored; it no longer directly sets `os.FileMode` but relies on new `common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms` constants (implying updates to `directories.go` not fully shown in this log, but consistent). The logic to clean the migration directory and create the recovery directory was removed from this function.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed entirely.
        *   A new `checkMigrationDirectory` function was added, which now proactively checks for existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath` and returns an error if found, preventing overwrites of recovery data.
        *   In `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, the handling for `fscrypt` command not found changed from returning an error and stopping execution to merely logging an error, allowing the program to continue.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM, 4:41:11 PM, 4:42:37 PM**: No functional code changes.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM**: A minor syntactic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` changed `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This new file introduces the application's entry point (`main`), defining `ExitCode` constants for standardized process return values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised). It embeds a version string, parses a `--mount` flag, and orchestrates the call flow to `integrity.go` functions like `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial commit of the `fscrypt` package, providing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error types related to encryption, implements `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific setup, and introduces the `EncryptionResult` struct to track success and various failure modes during directory encryption. The `encryptTargetDir` function outlines a multi-step process involving relocating contents, recreating and encrypting the target directory, and handling recovery.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A significant refactoring occurred:
        *   The `common` package import was temporarily removed, leading to a hardcoded path (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`) within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   New specific error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were formally defined.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its related methods (`Failed()`, `BuildError()`) were streamlined by removing the `FailedToRecover` field and its error handling.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's error handling was restructured with a `switch` statement, and the `encryptTargetDir` signature was altered to accommodate changes in data flow (removing `recoveryDir` as an argument).
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM (and subsequent identical entries at 4:37:36 PM, 4:40:23 PM, 4:40:46 PM)**: Further significant revisions:
        *   The `common` package import was re-added, resolving the hardcoded path issue.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error was re-introduced, and the `EncryptionResult` struct and its error handling methods were updated to include it again.
        *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored to use a `switch` statement for more explicit handling of global versus specific mount path setups.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to retrieve a `tempDir` path from `encryptTargetDir` and refined its error handling for `ErrFailedToRelocate`, including a partial `recoveryErr` mechanism.

The provided logs detail the development of an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity verification using `fscrypt`, TPM, and secure key management.

### File-specific Updates:

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
*   **Initial Commit (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** Defines critical constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `BootDirPath` (`/boot/integrity`), `EncryptedKeyPath` (`/boot/integrity/femk.enc`), `MigrationDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`), `RecoveryDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`), and `ManifestDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`). These paths are integral for storing handler files, encrypted keys, and data during migration/recovery processes.
*   **Minor Update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** A cosmetic change to the package comment, updating it from a detailed description of key storage to a simpler "contains common globals." No functional changes.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
*   **Initial Core Logic (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM):** This file contains the main business logic for the Integrity Handler. It defines functions like `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checks root user, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command, TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (orchestrates directory creation, FEMK resolution, `fscrypt` setup, and directory encryption), `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getFsKey` (securely retrieves and wipes FEMK), `ensureDirectoriesExist` (creates necessary directories with specific permissions and initially attempts to clean migration and recovery paths), and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` (logs warnings if recovery data exists).
*   **Significant Refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM - 4:42:37 PM):** This period shows a major overhaul of directory management within this file:
    *   The `os` package import is removed, simplifying dependencies.
    *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` is streamlined; it now uses permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) instead of hardcoded `os.FileMode` values, and the logic for cleaning/checking recovery/migration directories is removed from this function. This suggests these permission constants were added to `common/directories.go` (though not shown in these logs).
    *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function is entirely removed.
    *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, is introduced. Its purpose is to explicitly check for existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath` and return an error if found, preventing potential overwrites of recovery data.
    *   Error logging for `fscrypt` command not found in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` changes from returning an error to just logging a warning, allowing the function to continue.
    *   Minor cosmetic changes to variable declarations (`var errs []error = ...` to `errs := ...`) in `checkMigrationDirectory` are observed on 12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM and 4:42:37 PM.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
*   **Initial Commit (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This is the application's entry point. It sets up logging, parses a `mount` path command-line argument, defines `ExitCode` constants (aligning with `systemd` return values like `ExitSuccess`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`), embeds a version string, and orchestrates the calls to `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes detailed error handling to return appropriate `ExitCode`s based on integrity status.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
*   **Initial Commit (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** Introduces a dedicated package for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error variables related to encryption and migration, the `protectorName` ("FEMK"), `SetupOnMount` for global and mount-specific `fscrypt` configuration, and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track the outcome of encryption attempts. The core logic for `EncryptTargetDirs` involves relocating files, recreating and encrypting target directories, and then restoring contents. Initial error handling in `encryptTargetDir` includes moving failed operations to a recovery directory.
*   **First Major Refactoring (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
    *   Expanded error definitions to include `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct is updated (adding `FailedToRecover`, though its `Failed()` method doesn't initially count it).
    *   The `common` package is temporarily removed from imports, leading to hardcoded paths in `EncryptTargetDirs`.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` is refactored to handle errors returned from `encryptTargetDir` using a `switch` statement for specific failure types.
*   **Second Major Refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM - 4:40:46 PM):**
    *   Introduces `ErrFailedToRecover` explicitly.
    *   `EncryptionResult`'s `newEncryptionResult()` now correctly initializes `FailedToRecover`.
    *   `SetupOnMount` logic is re-architected with a `switch` statement to differentiate between global setup (for empty/root mount paths) and filesystem-specific setup (for upgrades), re-introducing the `common` package import.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` further refines its error handling for `ErrFailedToRelocate` and others, including a `recoveryErr` mechanism for partial copy failures.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **November 21, 2025, 2:26 PM - 2:40 PM:** Initial file creation and core logic implementation for `directories.go` and `integrity.go`.
*   **November 21, 2025, 4:00 PM:** Introduction of `main.go`, establishing the application's entry point and overall structure.
*   **November 21, 2025, 4:11 PM:** Creation of `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, introducing `fscrypt` integration and encryption flow.
*   **November 25, 2025, 4:04 PM:** First major refactoring in `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, enhancing error handling and modifying `EncryptTargetDirs`.
*   **December 1, 2025, 4:37 PM - 4:40 PM:** Continued significant refactoring in `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` (formalizing recovery errors, `SetupOnMount` logic, `common` package re-introduction) and a major rewrite in `integrity.go` (streamlined directory management, removal of old recovery handling, introduction of `checkMigrationDirectory`).
*   **December 1, 2025, 4:39 PM - 4:42 PM:** Minor, cosmetic code style adjustments in `integrity.go`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Focus on Security and Integrity:** The core purpose of the codebase is to provide "Config Integrity" through filesystem encryption, using TPM/vTPM for key protection, and implementing secure handling of keys via a `SecureContainer`.
*   **`fscrypt` Integration:** The `github.com/google/fscrypt` library is a central dependency, extensively used for filesystem encryption operations, including checks for kernel support and command line tool presence.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code exhibits a strong emphasis on detailed error management, defining numerous custom error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), using `errors.Is` for type checking, `errors.Join` for aggregating errors, and `fmt.Errorf` for context.
*   **Directory-based Operations:** A significant portion of the logic revolves around specific directory paths for configuration, migration, and recovery, emphasizing their creation, permissions, and state (e.g., checking for contents in migration directories).
*   **Idempotency as a Design Principle:** Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly marked as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for reliable, repeatable operations.
*   **Logging:** The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is used consistently for debugging, informational, warning, and error messages throughout the application, providing visibility into its execution.
*   **`afero` Filesystem Abstraction:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is utilized for abstracting filesystem operations, which is a common pattern for improving testability and potentially supporting different storage backends.
*   **"TODO" Comments:** Numerous "TODO" comments are scattered throughout the code, highlighting areas for future development, refinement, or potential improvements (e.g., manifest processing, better shredding, installation-time directory creation, unwind steps).

    *   **Initial Version (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file defines constant strings for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files). It initially included a comment indicating the "common" package dealt with a secure container for keys using mmap'ed and mlocked memory.
    *   **Minor Comment Update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** The package comment was updated to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," but the directory constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial Core Logic (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM):** Multiple log entries show an initial, stable version of the `integrity.go` file. This file contains functions crucial for the Integrity Handler's operation:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata`), presence of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, including ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading function for retrieving the FEMK, placing it into a `vault.SecureContainer` and wiping the plain key from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates required directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) with specific file permissions and includes logic to clean up the `MigrationDirPath`.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if the recovery directory contains unexpected contents.
    *   **Significant Refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM - 4:42:37 PM):**
        *   The `os` package import was removed, suggesting reduced direct OS interaction.
        *   Error handling for `fscrypt` command not found in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was changed from returning an error to just logging a warning.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function underwent major changes: it stopped using hardcoded permissions like `0o750` and `0o700`, instead adopting `common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, and `common.BootDirPerms` (implying new constants in the `common` package). The logic for cleaning `MigrationDirPath` and creating `RecoveryDirPath` was removed. A "TODO" comment suggests these directories should be created during installation.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was entirely removed.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced. This function actively checks for any contents in `common.MigrationDirPath` and returns a joined error if found, preventing overwriting previous recovery data. A minor syntax fix (`errs := make`) was applied to this function.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Application Entry Point (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This new file introduces the main application entry point.
        *   Defines standard process `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised).
        *   Embeds `integrity-handler.version` string.
        *   The `main` function parses a `mountPath` flag and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function serves as the orchestrator, initializing `appState`, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` (which was present in `integrity.go` at the time), `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes detailed error handling to return specific `ExitCode` values, particularly `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial `fscrypt` Wrappers (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file defines high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It declares numerous error constants (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFscryptNotSupportedOnMount`).
        *   `SetupOnMount` handles global `fscrypt` setup and filesystem-specific setup.
        *   Introduces `EncryptionResult` struct to categorize the outcomes of encryption attempts (Success, AlreadyEncrypted, FailedToRelocate, FailedToEncrypt, FailedToUnlock, FailedToRestore, FailedToRecover).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` iterates through directories, checks if already encrypted, and calls `encryptTargetDir`. The `encryptTargetDir` function involves moving contents to a temporary directory (`common.MigrationDirPath`), recreating the target, encrypting it, and then restoring contents.
    *   **Major Refactoring & `common` Import Removal (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
        *   The `common` package import was removed, which significantly altered how temporary and recovery directory paths were managed. `tempDir` creation became a hardcoded path.
        *   New explicit error constants `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were added.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified by removing `FailedToRecover`.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions were refactored for error handling. `encryptTargetDir` changed its signature to return `(string, error)` (the temporary directory path and an error), with `EncryptTargetDirs` now using a `switch` statement to categorize and append errors to the `EncryptionResult`.
    *   **Partial Reversion & Further Refinement (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM - 4:40:46 PM):**
        *   The `common` package import was re-added.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant and `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were re-introduced.
        *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored with a `switch` statement to handle global ("" or "/") and specific mount path setups, improving clarity.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was further refined. The logic for handling errors returned by `encryptTargetDir` was expanded within the `switch` statement, including attempts to recover contents for `ErrFailedToRelocate`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial implementation of the core Integrity Handler logic in `integrity.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of `main.go` as the application's entry point, orchestrating the Integrity Handler's lifecycle.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of `fscrypt.go` with detailed encryption/decryption mechanisms and error tracking.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, notably the temporary removal of the `common` package dependency and changes to error handling flow.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Significant updates across `fscrypt.go` and `integrity.go`, including re-introducing the `common` import in `fscrypt.go`, refining `SetupOnMount` and `EncryptTargetDirs` logic, and a major overhaul of directory creation and recovery-related functions in `integrity.go`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright & Ownership**: All files are consistently copyrighted to "Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025."
*   **Integrity and Encryption**: The overarching theme is ensuring system integrity through filesystem encryption, utilizing `fscrypt` and TPM (Trusted Platform Module) for key management.
*   **Go Language Features**: Extensive use of `context` for cancellation, `errors.New` and `errors.Join` for robust error handling, `fmt.Errorf("%w")` for error wrapping, and `filepath` for path manipulation.
*   **Logging**: The `log` package from `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` is used consistently for debugging, informational, warning, and error messages throughout the codebase.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `afero` library (`github.com/spf13/afero`) is used for abstracting filesystem operations, making the code potentially more testable and flexible.
*   **Directory Management**: A set of well-defined directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) are central to the application's operation for storing keys, migration data, recovery data, and manifests.
*   **"TODO" Comments**: Numerous "TODO" comments indicate ongoing development, areas for improvement, or future considerations, particularly regarding idempotency, error handling, and installation procedures.
*   **Secure Key Handling**: Explicit steps are taken to handle the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK) securely, including using a `vault.SecureContainer` and wiping sensitive key data from memory.

The changes log details the evolution of a Go application named "Integrity Handler" focused on filesystem encryption and integrity management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` for handler files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted FEMK (File Encryption Master Key), and directories under `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration data, recovery data, and integrity manifests.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor documentation update occurred, changing the package comment from describing a secure container to stating that it contains common globals for the Integrity Handler. The defined constants remained the same.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: This initial version of the core `integrity.go` file establishes foundational functions:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements such as root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process by ensuring directories exist, resolving/creating the FEMK, setting up `fscrypt`, and encrypting target directories.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Decrypts the FEMK and stores it in a secure vault, wiping the plaintext key afterwards.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates necessary migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with specified permissions, also cleaning the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if contents are found in the recovery directory.
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: These timestamps show identical content to the 2:27:15 PM version, indicating multiple saves without code changes.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Significant refactoring occurred:
        *   The `os` package was removed from imports.
        *   Error handling for `fscrypt` command not found in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was changed to log an error but not immediately return, allowing other initialization steps to proceed.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was modified to use permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) instead of hardcoded `os.FileMode` values, implying these constants were defined elsewhere. The logic for cleaning the migration directory and creating/handling the recovery directory was removed from this function.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced. This function checks the `common.MigrationDirPath` for any existing contents and returns a `joined error` if data is found, preventing overwrites and requiring manual intervention.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed from this file.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:41:11 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: These timestamps show content largely identical to the 4:38:57 PM version. A minor syntax change from `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)` occurred in `checkMigrationDirectory` at 4:39:52 PM, but no functional difference.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This new file implements the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application.
        *   It defines custom `ExitCode` constants (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with systemd service return codes.
        *   It embeds a version string using `//go:embed`.
        *   The `main` function parses a `mountPath` flag, initializes logging, calls the `run` function, and exits with an appropriate `ExitCode`.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow, including calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, and `enableIntegrity`. It contains logic to return `ExitCompromised` if unlocking directories fails.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   It defines numerous error constants related to fscrypt operations (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`).
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Configures fscrypt globally and on specific mount points, handling cases where it's already set up.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: Tracks the outcome of encryption attempts for multiple target directories, categorizing successes and various failure types (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, recovery).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through target directories, encrypting them if not already encrypted. The `encryptTargetDir` helper function attempts to move contents out, recreate the directory as empty, encrypt it, and then move contents back. It contains `TODO` comments regarding idempotency and recovery.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Significant refactoring for error handling and directory management:
        *   The `common` package import was temporarily removed.
        *   New specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced, while `ErrFailedToRecover` was removed from the list of `var` errors and the `EncryptionResult` struct.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to explicitly pass a hardcoded `tempDir` path (replacing `common.MigrationDirPath`) and handle different `encryptTargetDir` error types using a `switch` statement. On success, it removes the temporary directory. The snippet of `encryptTargetDir` is incomplete but indicates a change in its return signature to include an error.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: This version shows a partial reversal and further refinement:
        *   The `common` package import was re-added.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` constant was re-added.
        *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored with a `switch` statement to handle global setup for root/empty paths and specific filesystem setup for others, streamlining its logic.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct saw `FailedToRecover` re-added to its fields and the `Failed()` method updated to include it in the failure count.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to reflect `encryptTargetDir` now returning both a `tempDir` (string) and an `error`. The error handling `switch` statement began to expand, including an initial case for `ErrFailedToRelocate` that involves logging and appending to `result.FailedToRelocate`, and referencing a `recoveryErr`. This snippet is incomplete.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:40:23 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM**: These timestamps for `fscrypt.go` are identical to the 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM version, indicating no further functional changes in these saves.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright**: All files maintain a Juniper Networks copyright for the year 2025.
*   **Integrity and Encryption Focus**: The core purpose of the code is to manage filesystem integrity through encryption, leveraging `fscrypt` and TPM for key handling (FEMK).
*   **Error Handling and Reporting**: Consistent use of `errors.Join` and `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)` for comprehensive error reporting. An `EncryptionResult` struct is used to track detailed outcomes of batch encryption operations.
*   **Logging**: Extensive use of structured logging (`log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warnf`, `log.Errorf`) for tracing execution and issues.
*   **Idempotency**: Specific functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed and commented as idempotent, crucial for robust system operations.
*   **Directory Management**: Specific paths are defined and managed for temporary migration data, failure recovery, integrity manifests, and boot files. There's an evolution in how these directories are created, cleaned, and checked for pre-existing contents.
*   **Refactoring and Evolution**: The log shows a clear pattern of code refinement, especially in `fscrypt.go` and `integrity.go`, with temporary changes (like removing `common` import) being reversed or refined as the design matures (e.g., `SetupOnMount` logic, directory existence checks).

## 12:26:56 PM
The log details changes across three Go files within an `IntegrityHandler` application, primarily focused on filesystem encryption and integrity management. All files maintain a Juniper Networks copyright notice for the year 2025.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant directory paths crucial for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` for boot files and encrypted keys, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` for migration data, recovery, and manifest files. Comments indicate that the key will be held in a secure container using mmap'ed and mlocked memory.
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor documentation update changed the package description comment from detailing secure container mechanics to broadly stating it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." No functional code changes.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
This file, a core part of the Integrity Handler, undergoes significant refactoring over time, particularly in directory management and error handling.
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** (and subsequent identical entries until 2:40:35 PM):
    *   Introduced functions like `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root, kernel version, fscrypt support, TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (orchestrates FEMK creation, key retrieval, fscrypt setup, and directory encryption), and `unlockEncryptedDirs`.
    *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` initially handled creating migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with specific permissions and included logic to clean the migration directory.
    *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` was present, logging warnings if content was found in the recovery directory.
*   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**:
    *   Major refactoring in directory management: The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was simplified to use common permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`), indicating these permissions are now centrally defined. The logic for cleaning `common.MigrationDirPath` and creating `common.RecoveryDirPath` was removed from this function.
    *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings()` function was removed.
    *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory()`, was introduced. This function performs a more robust check on `common.MigrationDirPath`, explicitly returning an error if any contents are found, emphasizing the need for manual intervention to prevent data loss.
    *   A minor change in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` shifted error handling for `fscrypt` command not found from returning an error to logging it, potentially allowing the application to proceed despite the missing command.
*   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A minor syntactic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` (`var errs []error = make` to `errs := make`).
*   **Timestamp: 12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: The `enableIntegrity` function's error handling was enhanced to specifically check if encryption failures resulted in a "compromised" state using a new `Compromised()` method from `fscrypt.EncryptionResult`, joining the error with `errIntegrityCompromised` if so.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the entry point for the Integrity Handler.
    *   It defines `ExitCode` constants for standard process return values, including `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.
    *   It embeds the application version using `//go:embed`.
    *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow, including logging, initializing `appState`, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` (which was in `integrity.go` at this time), `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, and then `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. Error handling in `run` distinguishes between incompatible environments, generic failures, and integrity compromises.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
This file implements high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations, evolving error tracking and setup logic.
*   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**:
    *   Defines numerous error constants related to fscrypt operations (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`).
    *   Introduces `EncryptionResult` struct to track the success and various types of failures for target directories during encryption.
    *   `SetupOnMount` function for global and filesystem-specific fscrypt setup.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions, which initially handled relocating directory contents to a temporary location (`common.MigrationDirPath`), encrypting the now-empty target, and then moving contents back. Error handling included migrating to a `recoveryDir` on certain failures.
*   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**:
    *   **Removed the import of the `common` package**, leading to hardcoded paths for `tempDir` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`). This was a temporary design flaw.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct removed the `FailedToRecover` field, and its associated error constants and error aggregation logic were removed.
    *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions were refactored to change their parameters and return values, shifting error handling responsibility.
*   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**:
    *   **The `common` package import was restored**, correcting the hardcoded path issue from the previous change.
    *   A new error constant, `ErrFailedToRecover`, was re-introduced.
    *   The `SetupOnMount` function was refined with a `switch` statement to differentiate between global and specific mount path setups more clearly.
    *   Error handling within `EncryptTargetDirs` for relocation failures was updated, including a `recoveryErr` placeholder, indicating ongoing work on robust recovery mechanisms.
*   **Timestamp: 12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**:
    *   A new method, `Compromised()`, was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct. This method returns `true` if any directories failed to unlock, explicitly signaling an integrity compromise. This change aligns with the updated error handling in `integrity.go`.
*   Subsequent entries for `fscrypt.go` and `integrity.go` on 12/1 and 12/3 are minor or identical, suggesting stabilization after the significant refactoring around directory management and error handling.

**Key Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Focus on Security and Integrity:** The entire codebase revolves around securing directories through `fscrypt` encryption, utilizing TPM for key management, and robust integrity checks.
*   **Continuous Refinement of Error Handling:** A notable pattern is the iterative improvement of error reporting and recovery. The `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated methods (`Failed()`, `BuildError()`, `Compromised()`) demonstrate a move towards more detailed and actionable error information. The evolution of directory checks from warnings to explicit errors also highlights this.
*   **Directory Management Evolution:** Initial ad-hoc directory creation and cleanup in `integrity.go` transitioned to a more centralized and permission-aware approach, eventually integrating stricter pre-checks for migration directories.
*   **Idempotency:** Explicit comments in `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` emphasize the requirement for these operations to be idempotent, crucial for reliability in system management.
*   **Platform Specificity:** Checks for root user, minimum kernel version (5.4), and filesystem encryption support indicate a system-level tool.
*   **"TODO" Comments:** Numerous "TODO" comments persist, indicating areas for future development, such as improved unwinding logic, comprehensive recovery, better shredding, and integrating mount paths for upgrade scenarios.

## 1:27:04 PM
The provided log details changes to an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity. The core components involved are `common` definitions, the main `integrity` logic, and `fscrypt` wrappers.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
- **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of constants for key operational directories such as `/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`. These paths are crucial for storing encrypted keys (FEMK), migration data, recovery data, and integrity manifests. The package comment highlights its role in providing a secure container for keys using mmap'ed and mlocked memory.
- **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor textual change occurred in the package comment, rephrasing its purpose to "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." No functional changes were observed.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
- **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: The initial version of the core integrity logic was introduced. This includes functions for:
    - `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
    - `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, including directory creation, FEMK resolution, fscrypt setup, and encryption of target directories.
    - `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking of encrypted directories.
    - `getFsKey`: Securely loads the filesystem key into a `vault.SecureContainer`.
    - `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates necessary directories with specific permissions (`0o750`, `0o700`) and includes logic to clean the migration directory.
    - `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if contents are found in the recovery directory.
- **Between 11/21/2025 and 12/1/2025**: Multiple timestamps (2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM) show no functional changes in this file.
- **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Significant refactoring was applied:
    - The `os` import was removed.
    - Error handling for a missing `fscrypt` command was softened from returning an error to just logging a warning.
    - `ensureDirectoriesExist` was simplified to use new permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) from the `common` package, and removed the internal logic for cleaning the migration directory.
    - The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
    - A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was added to prevent overwriting existing migration data by erroring if contents are found in `common.MigrationDirPath`.
- **Between 12/1/2025 and 12/3/2025**: Several timestamps (4:39:02 PM, 4:39:52 PM, 4:41:11 PM) show no functional changes.
- **12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A minor syntax change in `checkMigrationDirectory` from `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)`.
- **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: The `enableIntegrity` function was updated to check for a "compromised" state using a new `result.Compromised()` method from `fscrypt.EncryptionResult`, joining `errIntegrityCompromised` if detected.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
- **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file was introduced as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitCompromised`), embeds the application version, parses a `mount` path argument, and orchestrates the call flow to `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes specific error handling to map different failure types to appropriate `ExitCode` values.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
- **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of the `fscrypt` package, providing high-level wrappers for encryption operations. It defines a set of specific error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), the `protectorName` as "FEMK," and `SetupOnMount` for configuring fscrypt. The `EncryptionResult` struct was introduced to track success and various failure modes during encryption. `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` handle the process of moving, encrypting, and restoring directory contents.
- **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A significant refactoring of error handling and directory management:
    - The `common` package was temporarily removed from imports, leading to hardcoded migration paths within `fscrypt.go`.
    - New explicit error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added, and `FailedToRecover` was removed from `EncryptionResult`, indicating a change in error tracking.
    - `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to perform more granular error handling using a `switch` statement on errors returned by `encryptTargetDir`, and to clean up temporary directories on success.
    - The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature and responsibilities were streamlined, returning a direct error instead of managing `EncryptionResult` details.
- **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Partial reversal and further refinement of the previous changes:
    - The `common` package import was re-added.
    - `ErrFailedToRecover` and the corresponding `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were re-introduced.
    - `SetupOnMount` was enhanced with a `switch` statement to differentiate global setup from specific mount point setup, improving clarity and robustness.
    - The `encryptTargetDir` function's return signature was modified to return both the temporary directory path and an error, giving the caller (`EncryptTargetDirs`) more control over cleanup and recovery. `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to handle this and specifically check for `ErrFailedToRecover`.
- **Between 12/1/2025 and 12/3/2025**: Several timestamps (4:37:36 PM, 4:40:23 PM, 4:40:46 PM) show no functional changes.
- **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: A new `Compromised()` method was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct. This method specifically indicates if any directories failed to unlock, serving as a clear flag for integrity violations.
- **Between 12/3/2025 and 12/3/2025**: Multiple subsequent timestamps (11:58:36 AM, 11:59:04 AM, 11:59:18 AM, 12:00:46 PM, 12:01:27 PM) show no functional changes.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

-   **Consistent Copyright**: All files begin with the same Juniper Networks copyright notice for the year 2025.
-   **Focus on Integrity and Encryption**: The entire project is dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" application, emphasizing filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and secure key management (FEMK) via TPM, indicating a strong security-oriented development.
-   **Robust Error Handling**: There is a consistent and evolving pattern of defining granular error types, collecting them in an `EncryptionResult` structure, and using `errors.Join` to aggregate multiple failures. This suggests a focus on providing detailed diagnostic information and graceful failure recovery.
-   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed and commented to be idempotent, ensuring that repeated calls do not lead to unintended side effects.
-   **Directory Management**: The application extensively manages specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, etc.) for operational data, migration, and recovery, with a clear focus on setting appropriate permissions and cleaning up temporary data.
-   **Code Refinement**: The timeline shows active development and refactoring, particularly in `fscrypt.go` and `integrity.go`, with changes in error handling strategy, import dependencies, and function responsibilities. This includes adding/removing/re-adding `FailedToRecover` fields and related logic, and refining the `SetupOnMount` process.
-   **Clear Exit Codes**: The `main.go` file establishes distinct exit codes for various application outcomes, including `ExitCompromised`, to integrate well with system management tools.
-   **Use of `afero.Fs`**: The consistent use of `afero.Fs` for filesystem operations across the relevant files suggests a design choice for testability and flexibility by abstracting the underlying filesystem.

## 1:38:05 PM
The provided log details changes to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` at Timestamp: 12/2/2025, 4:09:09 PM.

Due to the sensitive nature of files within the `.ssh` directory, which commonly store cryptographic keys and host fingerprints, a detailed summary of its content will not be generated to ensure security and privacy. These files are critical for secure shell access and typically contain host keys for verifying the authenticity of remote hosts, which should not be exposed.

## 2:27:01 PM
The log details the evolution of the `IntegrityHandler` Go application, primarily focusing on its `common`, `integrity`, and `fscrypt` packages between November 21st and December 3rd, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file consistently defines core directory paths as constants for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (`BootDirPath`), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (`EncryptedKeyPath`), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (`MigrationDirPath`), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (`RecoveryDirPath`), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (`ManifestDirPath`).
    *   **Later change (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** A minor comment update was made, clarifying the package's purpose from "secure container" to "common globals."

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial core logic (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM):** This file contains the main application logic, including functions to verify environmental requirements (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), enable integrity (encryption, `enableIntegrity`), and unlock encrypted directories (`unlockEncryptedDirs`). It established checks for root user, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command presence, and TPM initialization. It also included initial implementations for `ensureDirectoriesExist` and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`.
    *   **Refactoring and `main.go` introduction (around 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** While the log entry is for `main.go`, the content strongly indicates that the `main` function, `ExitCode` definitions, and the high-level `run` function were either created or moved into a dedicated `main.go` file at this point. This effectively separated the application's entry point and orchestration from the core `integrity.go` logic.
    *   **Significant Refinement (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM):**
        *   The `os` import was removed, suggesting less direct OS interaction or shifted responsibility.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was refactored to utilize new permission constants (`common.MigrationDirPerms`, etc.) from the `common` package, implying new constants were added there (though not shown in the log for `common/directories.go`). The previous logic for cleaning `MigrationDirPath` and explicitly creating `RecoveryDirPath` was removed.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was completely removed.
        *   A new function `checkMigrationDirectory` was introduced to explicitly check for existing contents in `MigrationDirPath` to prevent data loss during recovery, returning a joined error if contents are found.
        *   A crucial change in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` involved the error handling for `fscrypt` command not found: it shifted from returning a critical error (`fmt.Errorf`) to merely logging a warning (`log.Errorf`), allowing the application to continue even if `fscrypt` is not found.
    *   **Minor updates (12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM):** A minor stylistic change from `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)` in `checkMigrationDirectory`.
    *   **Error Handling Enhancement (12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM):** The `enableIntegrity` function was updated to check for a "compromised" state (`result.Compromised()`) from the `fscrypt` package's `EncryptionResult` when handling failed encryptions, combining it with the `errIntegrityCompromised` error.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial implementation (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file defined high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It introduced an `EncryptionResult` struct to track various success and failure states, `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem encryption setup, `EncryptTargetDirs` to manage the encryption process, and `encryptTargetDir` for individual directory encryption, including relocation and recovery logic. A range of specific error types were defined (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`).
    *   **Major Error Handling and Structure Refinement (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
        *   The import for `common` was temporarily removed, and `MigrationDirPath` was hardcoded within `encryptTargetDir`.
        *   New granular error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced, and the `EncryptionResult` struct and its `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated to include these.
        *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored to use a `switch` statement for clearer global vs. mount-specific setup.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature changed to return `tempDir` and an error, shifting error reporting responsibility. `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to use a `switch` statement to handle the specific error types returned by `encryptTargetDir`.
    *   **Reintroduction of `common` and `Recovery` (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM):**
        *   The `common` import was re-added, reversing the previous change, indicating a preference for centralized path definitions.
        *   A new error type `ErrFailedToRecover` was introduced, and `EncryptionResult` was updated to include it.
        *   `SetupOnMount` logic was further streamlined.
        *   Error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` was extended to specifically handle `ErrFailedToRelocate` and attempt recovery, demonstrating more robust error unwind steps.
    *   **Compromise Status (12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM):** A new method `Compromised()` was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct, returning true if any directories failed to unlock (`FailedToUnlock` is not empty). This provides a specific flag for integrity breaches.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial constants for directories (`common/directories.go`).
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** Initial core application logic (`integrity.go`).
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** Introduction/extraction of the `main.go` entry point and application orchestration.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** Initial detailed `fscrypt` implementation and error tracking (`fscrypt/fscrypt.go`).
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** Major refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, introducing granular error types and updating setup/encryption logic.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM:** `fscrypt.go` further refined with re-addition of `common` import, new recovery error, and enhanced error handling.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM:** `integrity.go` underwent substantial refactoring for directory management and a notable change in `fscrypt` command lookup error severity.
*   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM:** `integrity.go` improved error reporting by integrating the `Compromised()` status.
*   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM:** `fscrypt.go` added the `Compromised()` method to `EncryptionResult`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright & Ownership:** All files consistently bear the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` and are part of the `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler` project.
*   **Encryption and Integrity Focus:** The entire codebase is dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily concerned with filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and maintaining system integrity, particularly for configuration data.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** There's a strong and continuous pattern of refining error handling. This includes defining specific error types (e.g., `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`), using `errors.Join` for composite errors, and evolving `EncryptionResult` to provide detailed status. The introduction of `Compromised()` further highlights this focus on integrity-related failures.
*   **Directory Management:** Consistent use of predefined paths for migration, recovery, manifests, and boot files, managed by the `common` package. Functions like `ensureDirectoriesExist` and `checkMigrationDirectory` demonstrate careful handling of these critical directories.
*   **Idempotency:** Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly noted as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for reliable, repeatable operations.
*   **System Requirements Checks:** The application performs upfront checks for essential system requirements like root privileges, kernel version, and filesystem encryption support.
*   **Secure Key Management:** The mention of `vault.SecureContainer` and `tpm.InitializeTPM` indicates a reliance on secure hardware and in-memory key storage practices for the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK).

## 2:38:05 PM
The provided log entry for `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` contains SSH host keys, which are sensitive. As per the instructions, this file will not be summarized.

## 3:26:58 PM
The provided logs detail changes to a Go application named "Integrity Handler," primarily focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity management. The modifications span from November 21, 2025, to December 3, 2025, across three main files: `common/directories.go`, `integrity.go`, and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, along with the introduction of `main.go`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of constants for key directories: `BootDirPath`, `EncryptedKeyPath`, `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`. The package comment described its role in holding secure keys and common variables.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated to a more concise description: "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," removing the detailed explanation about secure containers and memory locking. No functional code changes occurred.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** (and subsequent identical entries until 2:40:35 PM): This file initially contains core logic for the Integrity Handler. Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command presence, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (handling directory creation, FEMK resolution, `fscrypt` setup, and directory encryption), `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getFsKey`, `ensureDirectoriesExist` (creating migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with specific permissions and including logic to clean the migration directory), and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This timestamp marks significant refactoring:
        *   The `os` import was removed, indicating a shift towards using wrapper functions or constants for file system operations.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was overhauled. It no longer determines permissions dynamically or attempts to clean the `MigrationDirPath` directly. Instead, it now relies on new `common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, and `common.BootDirPerms` constants (implying changes in the `common` package not explicitly shown here). The creation of `RecoveryDirPath` was removed from this function.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed entirely.
        *   A new function `checkMigrationDirectory` was introduced, responsible for verifying if `common.MigrationDirPath` contains any data, returning an error if it does to prevent overwrites and require manual intervention.
        *   Crucially, the error handling for `exec.LookPath("fscrypt")` in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was changed from a fatal error (`return fmt.Errorf`) to a logged warning (`log.Errorf`), allowing the application to continue even if the `fscrypt` command is not found.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: The `enableIntegrity` function's error handling was enhanced. If `result.Failed()` is true, it now additionally checks `result.Compromised()` and wraps the error with `errIntegrityCompromised` if an integrity violation (failure to unlock) occurred. This indicates a more nuanced approach to distinguishing between general failures and integrity breaches.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file was introduced, defining the main application entry point. It establishes standard exit codes (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`), embeds a version string, parses a mount path argument, and orchestrates the call to core integrity functions (`handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`). It maps specific errors to the defined exit codes.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation providing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt`. It defines numerous error types (`ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, etc.), a `protectorName` ("FEMK"), `SetupOnMount` logic for global and filesystem fscrypt setup, and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track success and various failure categories (including `FailedToRecover`). It also includes `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` for managing the encryption process, which at this point utilized `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath`.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A significant architectural change occurred:
        *   The `common` package import was *removed*.
        *   Several error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were redefined for clarity.
        *   The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct, and its usage was removed from `Failed()` and `BuildError()`.
        *   `SetupOnMount` logic was modified to be more explicit about global vs. specific mount point setup.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was refactored to handle `encryptTargetDir`'s return values more granularly with a `switch` statement for error types, and it hardcoded the `tempDir` path, replacing the use of `common.MigrationDirPath`. The `encryptTargetDir` function signature changed to accept `tempDir` as an argument.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: A partial rollback/re-evaluation related to the previous change:
        *   The `common` package import was *re-added*.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error variable and the `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were re-introduced, and `Failed()` was updated to include it again.
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function was further refined with a `switch` statement for `mountPath`, explicitly differentiating global setup (for empty or "/" mountPath) from filesystem-specific setup.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's call to `encryptTargetDir` was modified again, no longer passing `tempDir` directly, suggesting `encryptTargetDir` would now obtain it from the (re-imported) `common` package. The error handling was expanded to include `recoveryErr` logic.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: A new method, `Compromised()`, was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct. This method specifically checks if `len(result.FailedToUnlock) != 0`, providing a dedicated flag for integrity violations, aligning with the update in `integrity.go` at a similar timestamp.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright (2025):** All files consistently include the copyright notice for Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025.
*   **"Integrity Handler" Application:** The overarching context is a Go application named "Integrity Handler" focused on secure filesystem operations.
*   **`fscrypt` and TPM Integration:** The application heavily relies on `fscrypt` for disk encryption and TPM (Trusted Platform Module) for key management, specifically for the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK).
*   **Robust Error Handling:** There's a strong emphasis on defining specific error types and aggregating them in an `EncryptionResult` struct, which tracks various stages of success and failure during the encryption process. This structure is continuously refined to provide detailed feedback on operations.
*   **Idempotency:** Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly noted as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for consistent behavior on repeated execution.
*   **Directory Management Evolution:** The definition and handling of special directories (`.migration-store`, `migration-recovery`, `manifest.d`, `/boot/integrity`) are central, with several changes aimed at streamlining their creation, permission setting, and integrity checks.
*   **`common` Package Usage:** The `common` package serves as a central point for shared constants, particularly directory paths. Its temporary removal and re-addition in `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` highlight an ongoing evolution in dependency management and code structure.
*   **Security Focus:** The use of `vault.SecureContainer` and wiping `plainKey` after use underscores a strong focus on security and protecting cryptographic keys at runtime.
*   **Refinement of Logic:** Several changes, such as the `SetupOnMount` logic in `fscrypt.go` and the error return values/handling, indicate a continuous process of refining and hardening the application's core functionality.

*   **File Path:** `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`
*   **Timestamp:** 12/2/2025, 4:09:09 PM

As per the instructions, changes to files containing keys, such as `.ssh/known_hosts`, are excluded from the summary. Therefore, no key information from this log entry is summarized.

## 4:26:59 PM
The provided logs detail changes across three Go files within an `IntegrityHandler` application, focusing on filesystem encryption, key management, and robust error handling. The primary goal of the application appears to be securing specific directories using `fscrypt` and a TPM-backed key.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** This file defines core constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** A minor comment update occurred, changing the description of the package to "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined constants remained unchanged.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps (multiple, 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM to 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM):** These entries show the initial, stable version of the `integrity.go` file. Key functionalities include:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system requirements like root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata.CheckSupport`), `fscrypt` command presence, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving/creating the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up fscrypt, and encrypting target directories. This function is explicitly marked as idempotent.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: A lazy-loading mechanism for the filesystem key, ensuring it's securely stored in a `vault.SecureContainer`.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates various operational directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) with initial permissions and includes logic to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if data is found in the recovery directory, indicating a previous failure requiring manual intervention.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM (and subsequent minor changes until 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM):**
        *   **Refactoring of Directory Management:** The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was significantly streamlined. It now utilizes new `common` package constants for directory permissions (`common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms`) and no longer handles the creation of `RecoveryDirPath` or the cleaning of `MigrationDirPath`.
        *   **New Migration Check:** A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced to explicitly check for contents in `MigrationDirPath` and return an error if any are found, preventing potential data loss from overwriting previous recovery attempts. This replaces the cleaning logic from `ensureDirectoriesExist` and also the separate `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function (which was removed from this file).
        *   **Error Handling Adjustment:** The handling for `fscrypt` command not found in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` changed from returning a fatal error to logging an error and continuing, implying a reduction in severity for this specific check, though the overall function still returns an error for other failures.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM (and subsequent fix at 12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM):**
        *   **Enhanced Error Reporting for Integrity:** The `enableIntegrity` function was updated to leverage a new `Compromised()` method (expected in `fscrypt.EncryptionResult`). If `fscrypt.EncryptTargetDirs` returns a failed result that is also marked as "compromised," the error is now explicitly wrapped with `errIntegrityCompromised`. The initial change had a minor bug in error wrapping (`errors.Join` without assignment) which was corrected in the final timestamp to correctly use `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", errIntegrityCompromised, err)`.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** This file serves as the application's entry point.
        *   Defines `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`) that align with systemd service return codes.
        *   Uses `//go:embed` to include the application version.
        *   The `main` function sets up logging, parses command-line arguments (e.g., `mount` path), and orchestrates the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function initializes the application state, calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` (which was in `integrity.go` at this time), verifies the environment, calls `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, and maps any errors to the appropriate `ExitCode`.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** This initial version provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   Defines numerous error types (`ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, etc.) to detail various failure modes.
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Manages global and mount-specific fscrypt setup, ensuring idempotency.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: A key component to aggregate and categorize the outcomes of encryption attempts, including success, already encrypted, and various failure types (`FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`, `FailedToRestore`, `FailedToRecover`).
        *   `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods: Provide a consolidated way to check for and report overall encryption failures.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through target directories, checks if they are already encrypted, and calls `encryptTargetDir` for actual encryption.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Implements the detailed steps for encryption: relocating contents, recreating the target directory, encrypting it, and handling errors (though the snippet shows incomplete recovery logic). It directly references `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath`.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:**
        *   **Error Type Refinement:** New specific error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added.
        *   **Simplified `EncryptionResult` (temporary):** The `FailedToRecover` field and its related logic were temporarily removed from `EncryptionResult`.
        *   **Refactored `EncryptTargetDirs`:** The direct use of `common` package paths for temporary directories was removed from `EncryptTargetDirs`. The `encryptTargetDir` function signature was changed to return a `tempDir` path and an error, and the calling `EncryptTargetDirs` function introduced a `switch` statement for more granular error handling after calling `encryptTargetDir`. The `common` package import was removed, suggesting these paths would be passed in or handled differently.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM (and subsequent identical changes until 12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM):**
        *   **Re-introduction of Recovery Error:** `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-added as an error type, and the `EncryptionResult` struct was updated to include the `FailedToRecover` field again. The `common` package import was also re-added.
        *   **Enhanced `SetupOnMount`:** The `SetupOnMount` function was updated with a `switch` statement to differentiate global fscrypt setup (for empty or root mount paths) from specific filesystem mount setups, particularly noting assumptions for upgrade scenarios.
        *   **Improved `EncryptTargetDirs` Error Handling:** The error handling `switch` in `EncryptTargetDirs` was expanded to include specific logic for `ErrFailedToRelocate`, indicating more robust recovery attempts.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM (and subsequent identical changes until 12/3/2025, 12:01:27 PM):**
        *   **New `Compromised()` Method:** A `Compromised()` method was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct. This method specifically checks if any failures were categorized as `FailedToUnlock`, providing a direct way to identify integrity violations.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright & Authoring:** All files consistently use a Juniper Networks copyright notice for the year 2025.
*   **Focus on Security & Integrity:** The codebase is entirely dedicated to "Config Integrity," involving filesystem encryption with `fscrypt`, TPM integration, and secure key handling using a `SecureContainer` (vault). The `errIntegrityCompromised` error appears frequently, highlighting this core concern.
*   **Idempotent Operations:** Several critical functions (e.g., `enableIntegrity`, `EncryptTargetDirs`) are explicitly designed and commented as idempotent, crucial for reliable system operation.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** There's a strong emphasis on detailed error reporting through custom error types, `errors.Join`, `fmt.Errorf` with wrapping, and the `EncryptionResult` struct. The evolution of `fscrypt.go` shows continuous refinement of error tracking and recovery logic.
*   **Directory Standardization:** A set of specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, etc.) are consistently used across the application, with efforts to centralize their management and permission handling within the `common` package.
*   **"TODO" Comments:** Numerous "TODO" comments indicate areas for future work, improvement, or potential refactoring, suggesting an ongoing development process. These often relate to error recovery, idempotency, or integration with main application flow.
*   **Dependencies:** Consistent use of external libraries like `github.com/google/fscrypt` and `github.com/spf13/afero` (for filesystem abstraction), alongside internal packages for common utilities, TPM interaction, and secure vault functionalities.

The provided log contains changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file. As this file stores cryptographic keys, it falls under the category of sensitive information that should not be summarized. Therefore, no summary will be generated for this file.

## 5:27:03 PM
The log details development activity for an "Integrity Handler" application, part of the `Juniper-SSN/ssr` project, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity management. All changes are consistently dated in late 2025 and include a Juniper Networks copyright notice.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**:
    *   Initially (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM), this file defined constants for critical directory paths like `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`.
    *   A minor comment clarification occurred on 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**:
    *   **Initial implementations (up to 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM)**: Established functions for environment validation (checking root, kernel, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` for encryption, `unlockEncryptedDirs`, and `getFsKey` for secure key handling. It included `ensureDirectoriesExist` to create necessary paths and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to check for migration recovery data.
    *   **Major refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM)**: The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was significantly simplified, moving permission constants to the `common` package (though their definition isn't shown in the `common/directories.go` log entries) and removing the explicit cleanup of `MigrationDirPath`. The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed and replaced by a new `checkMigrationDirectory` function that strictly errors if the migration directory contains contents, preventing accidental overwrites. Error logging for the `fscrypt` command lookup was changed from a blocking error to a log message.
    *   **Error handling refinement (12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM and 2:04:54 PM)**: The `enableIntegrity` function was updated to check for a "compromised" state (as determined by `fscrypt.EncryptionResult`) and to wrap the returned error with `errIntegrityCompromised` if such a state is detected.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM)**: Defined `ExitCode` constants for various application outcomes, embedded a version string, set up command-line argument parsing for a `mountPath`, and orchestrated the `run` function which calls core integrity operations, including an initial call to `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings()`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**:
    *   **Initial implementation (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM)**: Introduced various error constants related to `fscrypt` operations, defined the `EncryptionResult` struct for tracking encryption outcomes (success, various failure types including relocate, encrypt, unlock, restore, recover), and implemented `SetupOnMount` for fscrypt initialization and `EncryptTargetDirs` with `encryptTargetDir` for the core encryption process. It initially imported the `common` package.
    *   **Temporary refactoring (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM)**: Temporarily removed the import of the `common` package, leading to hardcoded migration paths. It added explicit error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`), removed `FailedToRecover` from `EncryptionResult`, and changed function signatures in `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` to return errors more directly for better unwinding logic.
    *   **Reverted and enhanced (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM)**: The `common` package import was re-added, `ErrFailedToRecover` and `FailedToRecover` were restored to `EncryptionResult`. `SetupOnMount` was further refined with a `switch` statement for different mount paths (global vs. specific mountpoints for upgrades). The error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` was expanded to robustly manage various failure types during the encryption and migration process.
    *   **New `Compromised()` method (12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM)**: Added a `Compromised()` helper method to `EncryptionResult` to specifically indicate if any `FailedToUnlock` errors occurred, marking a critical integrity violation.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **November 21, 2025 (afternoon)**: Core functionalities and initial structure were laid out across all `IntegrityHandler` components.
*   **November 25, 2025 (afternoon)**: `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` underwent a notable refactoring, including a temporary removal of the `common` package dependency and restructuring of error reporting.
*   **December 1, 2025 (afternoon)**: Both `integrity.go` and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` saw significant updates, primarily revolving around refining directory management, error handling, and the re-integration of the `common` package into `fscrypt.go`.
*   **December 3, 2025 (late morning to early afternoon)**: Final refinements to error handling logic were made in `integrity.go` and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, specifically introducing and utilizing the `Compromised()` method.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on Security**: The primary goal is maintaining "integrity" and implementing filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM, emphasizing secure handling of the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK).
*   **Idempotent Operations**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent, ensuring they can be run multiple times safely.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling**: There is a strong emphasis on detailed error reporting and recovery. New error types are consistently introduced, `EncryptionResult` accumulates various failure states, and error wrapping (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`) is used for context preservation. Custom `ExitCode` values in `main.go` reflect different failure conditions.
*   **Directory Management Evolution**: Functions for creating, cleaning, and checking critical application directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`) are frequently revised to ensure correct permissions and prevent data loss or overwrites.
*   **"TODO" Comments**: Many "TODO" comments point to ongoing development areas, such as further enhancing recovery mechanisms, processing manifest files, and refining context plumbing, indicating an active and iterative development process.
*   **Standard Go Practices**: The code utilizes modern Go features like `context.Context`, `errors.Join`, and `afero.Fs` for robust, testable, and maintainable software.

## 6:26:58 PM
The codebase primarily focuses on an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, developed by Juniper Networks in 2025, aimed at securing filesystems through encryption using `fscrypt` and a TPM (Trusted Platform Module). Key themes include robust error handling, idempotent operations, and meticulous directory management for migration and recovery.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially established to define constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler. These paths include `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for integrity manifests).
*   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor, cosmetic change was made to a comment in the package description.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM**: During this period, the core logic for the Integrity Handler was defined. This includes functions to:
    *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Check system requirements (root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command availability) and initialize TPM.
    *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrate directory creation, FEMK resolution, `fscrypt` setup, and target directory encryption.
    *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlock previously encrypted directories.
    *   `getFsKey`: Securely load and manage the filesystem key.
    *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Create necessary migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with specific permissions, including initial logic to clean the migration directory.
    *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Warn about contents in the recovery directory.
    *   Multiple timestamps (e.g., 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM) show no functional changes, indicating minor saves or metadata updates.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: The `main.go` file (not `integrity.go`, but relevant as it uses `integrity.go` functions) was updated to define `ExitCode` enums, embed a version string, parse a mount path, and invoke the integrity setup workflow. It calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs` functions, handling different exit scenarios including integrity compromise.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Significant refactoring occurred:
    *   The `os` import was removed.
    *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was simplified; hardcoded permissions were replaced by references to `common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, and `common.BootDirPerms` (implying new permission constants in `directories.go` or a related file, not shown in this log). The logic to clean `MigrationDirPath` and create `RecoveryDirPath` was removed.
    *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` was renamed to `checkMigrationDirectory` and its functionality changed to *error* if the migration directory contains data, preventing overwrites, rather than just warning about recovery directories.
    *   Error handling for `fscrypt` command not found in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was changed from returning an error to logging it as an error.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM - 4:42:37 PM**: Several commits within this minute range and a few minutes later are identical, indicating minor saves or cosmetic changes, with one specific minor change in `checkMigrationDirectory` at 4:42:37 PM from `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)`.
*   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: The `enableIntegrity` function's error handling was enhanced to specifically flag `errIntegrityCompromised` if the `fscrypt.EncryptionResult` indicates a compromised state (using a newly introduced `Compromised()` method).
*   **12/3/2025, 12:01:50 PM**: No functional change.
*   **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: The error handling in `enableIntegrity` was further refined to ensure `errIntegrityCompromised` wraps other errors when integrity is compromised, making it the primary error.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**

*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: The `fscrypt` package was introduced to provide high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. This includes:
    *   Definition of numerous `Err` constants for specific failure scenarios (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`).
    *   `SetupOnMount` function for global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup.
    *   `EncryptionResult` struct to track success and various failure categories during encryption.
    *   Methods like `Failed()`, `BuildError()`, and `Error()` for comprehensive error reporting.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions implementing the core encryption logic, including temporarily moving directory contents, encrypting the empty directory, and restoring contents. This initial version directly referenced `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath`.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Substantial changes were made to the `EncryptionResult` struct and error handling:
    *   `ErrFailedToRecover` was temporarily removed from `EncryptionResult` and related error tracking functions.
    *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was refactored to use a `switch` statement for more granular error handling of the return value from `encryptTargetDir`.
    *   The `common` import was temporarily removed, and `tempDir` path was hardcoded within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
    *   New, more descriptive error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were introduced.
    *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was changed to return `error` instead of implicitly modifying a result object.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: This commit largely reverted the temporary changes from 11/25 and introduced further refinements:
    *   The `common` import was re-added, allowing the use of centralized path constants.
    *   `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-introduced into `EncryptionResult` and error tracking.
    *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored to use a `switch` statement to differentiate global setup from specific mount path setup more cleanly.
    *   The `encryptTargetDir` signature was changed again to return `(string, error)`, allowing `EncryptTargetDirs` to manage the temporary directory path for cleanup.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM - 12/3/2025, 12:01:27 PM**: This series of timestamps shows numerous identical commits.
*   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: A new method, `Compromised()`, was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct, specifically indicating if any directories failed to unlock (a critical integrity violation). This method is subsequently used in `integrity.go`.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of core directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial implementation of the main Integrity Handler logic and functions.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of the `main.go` entry point, orchestrating the integrity process.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of the `fscrypt` package with encryption result tracking.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactor of error handling and temporary removal of `common` package dependency in `fscrypt.go`.

*   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM & 2:04:54 PM**: Refinements to `enableIntegrity`'s error handling to explicitly highlight integrity compromise, leveraging the new `Compromised()` method.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyrights**: All files include a "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved." header.
*   **Go Modules and Imports**: Consistent use of standard Go libraries (`context`, `errors`, `fmt`, `os/exec`, `path/filepath`) and external dependencies (`github.com/google/fscrypt`, `github.com/spf13/afero`, `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`).
*   **Error Management**: Extensive and evolving error handling, including specific error types (e.g., `ErrIntegrityCompromised`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), `errors.Join` for composite errors, and `errors.Is` for checking error types.
*   **Directory-centric Operations**: Frequent creation, cleanup, and status checks of specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, etc.) with careful attention to file permissions.
*   **Idempotency Requirement**: Comments explicitly state that core functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are designed to be idempotent.
*   **Security Focus**: The overall application aims to ensure "Config Integrity" through filesystem encryption and relies on TPM for key security, reflecting a strong security-first approach.
*   **Logging**: Consistent use of a custom `log` package (`log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warn`, `log.Error`) across both `integrity.go` and `fscrypt.go` for detailed operational insights.
*   **Incremental Refinement**: The log shows a pattern of initial implementation followed by several small, iterative changes, and then larger refactors (especially in error handling and directory management logic in `fscrypt.go` and `integrity.go`), demonstrating an evolving understanding and hardening of the application's logic.

## 7:26:56 PM
The core of these code changes revolves around a Go application named "Integrity Handler" responsible for managing filesystem encryption, likely for security purposes, involving `fscrypt` and TPM. All files consistently include a Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initializes constants defining critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files). The package comment clarifies its role in holding keys securely at runtime.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM:** A minor clarification in the package comment, changing "Package container common a secure container..." to "Package common contains common globals...".

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial changes (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM):** Establishes the primary logic for the Integrity Handler. Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root user, kernel version >= 5.4, and filesystem encryption support via `fscrypt`, and initializing TPM), `enableIntegrity` (setting up necessary directories, resolving and obtaining the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the mount, and encrypting target directories), and `unlockEncryptedDirs` (for decrypting previously encrypted directories). Directory creation and cleanup (`ensureDirectoriesExist`, `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`) are defined. Error handling introduces `errIntegrityCompromised`.
    *   **Significant Refactor (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM - 4:42:37 PM):**
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was refactored to use dedicated permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) instead of hardcoded `os.FileMode` values, and the logic for cleaning the migration directory and creating the recovery directory was removed from here.
        *   A new function `checkMigrationDirectory` was added to proactively check for residual contents in `common.MigrationDirPath` and return an error if found, requiring manual intervention to prevent data loss. This changes the recovery strategy from warning to explicit error.
        *   Error handling for `fscrypt command not found` in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was changed from returning an error to just logging a warning, allowing the program to continue if other requirements are met.
        *   Minor syntactic adjustment in `checkMigrationDirectory` related to slice declaration (`var errs []error = ...` to `errs := ...`).
    *   **Error Handling Enhancement (12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM - 2:04:54 PM):**
        *   The `enableIntegrity` function's error handling for `result.Failed()` was enhanced. It now checks for a `Compromised()` state on the `EncryptionResult` (implying a new method in `fscrypt.EncryptionResult`) and explicitly wraps the integrity compromised error using `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", errIntegrityCompromised, err)`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** Introduces the `main` package, defining `ExitCode` constants for standardized process return values (e.g., `ExitSuccess`, `ExitCompromised`). It includes embedding the application version and parsing a `mount` path flag. The `run` function orchestrates the initialization and encryption/unlocking process, mapping errors from `Integrity Handler` functions to appropriate `ExitCode` values.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial changes (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** Defines high-level wrappers around `fscrypt` operations. It introduces a comprehensive set of error constants (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`). The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the outcome of encryption attempts for various targets. `SetupOnMount` handles global and specific filesystem `fscrypt` setup. `EncryptTargetDirs` orchestrates the encryption of multiple directories, involving relocating contents, encrypting the empty directory, and restoring contents. This initial version directly used `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath`.
    *   **Significant Refactor (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
        *   The direct import of the `common` package was removed, indicating a decoupling of `fscrypt.go` from global directory path constants. Temporary directory paths were instead constructed locally within functions using hardcoded prefixes (e.g., `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`).
        *   New explicit error constants `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were added.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was simplified, removing `FailedToRecover` from its fields and related methods.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` signatures and internal logic were refactored to manage temporary paths and error handling more granularly, with error types being checked explicitly in a `switch` statement.
    *   **Partial Revert/Further Refinement (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM):**
        *   The `common` package import was re-added.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant was re-introduced (though `EncryptionResult` still did not track it).
        *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored to use a `switch` statement to handle global setup (for mount paths "" or "/") and default filesystem setup separately.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's return signature and its call in `EncryptTargetDirs` were adjusted again to better manage temporary directories.
    *   **New `Compromised()` Method (12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM):** A new method `Compromised()` was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct, returning `true` if any directories failed to unlock (`len(result.FailedToUnlock) != 0`). This directly supports the enhanced error handling in `integrity.go`.
    *   **Subsequent Entries (12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM - 12/3/2025, 12:01:27 PM):** These entries for `fscrypt.go` contain largely identical code, suggesting minor, non-functional commits or re-saves after the major changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security Focus:** The codebase consistently emphasizes security, using terms like "secure container," "mlocked memory," "TPM," "FEMK encryption," and "integrity compromised."
*   **Error-driven Development:** There is a strong emphasis on detailed error handling and reporting, with numerous specific error types defined and a complex `EncryptionResult` struct to categorize various failure modes. The evolution of error wrapping (`errors.Join`, `fmt.Errorf`) and the introduction of a `Compromised()` state highlight this.
*   **Idempotency:** Functions responsible for critical operations like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly documented as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for robust, repeatable execution.
*   **Directory Structure:** A consistent set of `/boot/integrity` and `/opt/128technology/integrity/` subdirectories are used for operational data, migration, recovery, and manifests.
*   **`fscrypt` Integration:** The application heavily relies on the `github.com/google/fscrypt` library for underlying filesystem encryption capabilities.
*   **Refactoring of Migration/Recovery Logic:** A clear pattern of iterative improvement can be seen in how migration and recovery directory handling evolved, moving towards more explicit checks and error reporting rather than just warnings.
*   **Timestamps:** Most significant functional changes occurred between November 21st and December 3rd, 2025, with multiple minor updates or re-saves scattered throughout.

The provided log entry is for `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`. As per the instructions, sensitive files that may store keys will not be summarized.

## 8:26:53 PM
The code changes primarily focus on the **Integrity Handler** Go application, which is responsible for filesystem encryption, key management, and maintaining system integrity, particularly using `fscrypt` and TPM. The development logs span from November 21, 2025, to December 3, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

**1. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
- **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant paths for critical directories used by the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and the encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files).
- **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor comment update was made to the package description.

**2. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
- **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM**: Multiple commits over this period show the initial implementation and minor revisions.
    - **`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`**: This function establishes environmental prerequisites, checking for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata`), the presence of the `fscrypt` command-line utility, and TPM initialization.
    - **`enableIntegrity`**: Orchestrates the encryption process, ensuring necessary directories exist, resolving/creating the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), setting up `fscrypt` on the target mount, and encrypting specified directories. It emphasizes idempotency.
    - **`unlockEncryptedDirs`**: Handles unlocking previously encrypted directories, with failures leading to an `errIntegrityCompromised` status.
    - **`getFsKey`**: Securely retrieves and stores the FEMK in a `SecureContainer`, explicitly wiping the plaintext key from memory after use.
    - **`ensureDirectoriesExist`**: Manages the creation of migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with specific permissions, including an initial attempt to clean the migration directory.
    - **`handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`**: A function that checks for residual data in the recovery directory and logs warnings if found.
- **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This commit introduces significant refactoring:
    - The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was streamlined. It now delegates directory permissions to new `common` package constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`), removing hardcoded permissions and the inline cleanup logic for `MigrationDirPath`. The creation of `RecoveryDirPath` was also removed from this function.
    - The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
    - A new function, **`checkMigrationDirectory`**, was added. This function now explicitly checks the `common.MigrationDirPath` for any existing contents and returns an error if found, preventing overwriting or conflicts from previous failed migrations.
- **12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM**: A change in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was made to log an error if the `fscrypt` command is not found, rather than returning an error and halting execution immediately.
- **12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM - 4:42:37 PM**: Minor cosmetic changes, such as using short variable declaration `errs := make(...)` in `checkMigrationDirectory`.
- **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM - 2:04:54 PM**: Updates to `enableIntegrity` were made to integrate with a new `Compromised()` method from `fscrypt.EncryptionResult`, allowing for a more specific `errIntegrityCompromised` error to be returned if a compromise is detected during encryption.

**3. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
- **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application.
    - It configures logging, parses a `mount` path flag, and defines standard `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised).
    - The `run` function orchestrates the application flow, including version logging, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` (which was later removed from `integrity.go`), `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`.
    - It uses `DefaultManifest()` to define initial encryption targets, indicating that the target manifest processing is still under development (`TODO`).
    - Error handling is present to return specific `ExitCode` values based on the nature of the failure (e.g., `ExitIncompatible` for environment issues, `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations during unlock).

**4. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
- **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation.
    - Defines a comprehensive set of `Err*` constants for various `fscrypt` related failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`, `ErrFailedToRecover`).
    - **`SetupOnMount`**: Handles the initialization of `fscrypt` globally and on specific mount points.
    - **`EncryptionResult` struct**: A detailed structure to report the outcomes of encryption attempts, categorizing successes, already encrypted paths, and various failure types. It includes `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods.
    - **`EncryptTargetDirs`**: The main function for encrypting directories, aiming for idempotency. It calls `encryptTargetDir` for individual targets.
    - **`encryptTargetDir`**: Contains the core logic for moving contents out of a target directory, recreating it empty, encrypting it, and then moving contents back. The provided snippet ends with incomplete error handling, suggesting ongoing development.
- **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Significant changes were made:
    - The `common` package import was temporarily removed (later re-added).
    - Refinements to existing `Err*` messages and removal of `FailedToRecover` from `EncryptionResult`, `Failed()`, and `BuildError()`.
    - The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's internal error handling for `encryptTargetDir` was refactored, now expecting `encryptTargetDir` to return `tempDir` and an error, and using a `switch` statement for specific error handling. Cleanup of `tempDir` on success was added.
    - The `encryptTargetDir` signature was updated to accept `tempDir`.
- **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Another significant refactor:
    - The `common` package import was re-added.
    - A new `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-introduced, and `FailedToRecover` was added back to `EncryptionResult` struct, `Failed()` method, and `BuildError()` method, indicating renewed focus on comprehensive recovery.
    - `SetupOnMount` was refactored to use a `switch` statement for `mountPath`, explicitly handling global setup (`""` or `/`) versus filesystem-specific setup.
    - `EncryptTargetDirs` further refined its error handling `switch` statement to include `ErrFailedToRecover`, suggesting more granular error recovery strategies.
- **12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM - 4:40:46 PM**: Minor content changes, likely quick saves during development.
- **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM - 12:01:27 PM**:
    - A new method, **`Compromised()`**, was added to `EncryptionResult`. This method returns `true` specifically if any directories failed to unlock (`FailedToUnlock` array is not empty), providing a clear indicator of an integrity violation. This directly supports the updated error handling in `integrity.go`. Minor subsequent saves.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

- **Focus on Security and Integrity**: The entire codebase, especially the "Integrity Handler" naming, the use of `fscrypt`, TPM initialization, `SecureContainer` for FEMK, and integrity compromise error handling, underscores a strong emphasis on system security and data integrity.
- **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are designed to be idempotent, ensuring that repeated calls do not lead to unintended side effects or errors.
- **Robust Error Handling**: The code features extensive error definitions and structured error handling (`errors.Join`, `errors.Is`, `fmt.Errorf`) to provide detailed feedback on various failure scenarios during encryption and key management.
- **Directory Management and Permissions**: There's a consistent pattern of defining and managing specific directories for migration, recovery, manifests, and boot files, often with explicit permission settings, which are being centralized to `common` package constants.
- **Logging**: The application heavily uses a `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) for debugging, informational, and error messages, crucial for monitoring and troubleshooting.
- **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All files consistently include the copyright notice for Juniper Networks, Inc.
- **Iterative Development**: The frequent timestamps, sometimes seconds apart, especially for `fscrypt.go` on 12/1 and `integrity.go` on 11/21, suggest an active and iterative development process with frequent saving and small commits.
- **TODO Comments**: Numerous `TODO` comments indicate ongoing work, planned features, or areas for improvement, particularly concerning error unwind steps, integration of paths, and moving directory creation to installation.

No summary will be generated for the provided log entry, as the file path `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` contains sensitive cryptographic keys, which falls under the category of files storing keys.

## 9:26:57 PM
The provided logs detail changes across three Go source files belonging to an `IntegrityHandler` application, primarily focused on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt`. The project consistently uses a "Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025" copyright.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
- **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of key constants for directory paths: `BootDirPath`, `EncryptedKeyPath`, `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`. These paths are `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` respectively.
- **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was slightly rephrased for clarity, but no functional code changes were made.

**2. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
This file, implementing the core Integrity Handler logic, saw several stages of refinement.
- **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM**: Initial versions defined core functions:
    - `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Ensures the environment meets requirements (root user, kernel >= 5.4, fscrypt support, TPM initialization).
    - `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates directory creation, FEMK resolution, fscrypt setup, and target directory encryption.
    - `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks previously encrypted directories.
    - `getFsKey`: Securely retrieves the FEMK.
    - `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates necessary directories (`MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, `BootDirPath`) with initial permissions. This version also included logic to clean up `MigrationDirPath` and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to check for contents in `RecoveryDirPath`.
- **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This log entry refers to `main.go` and introduces the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` enums (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) and the `run` function which calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, and the core encryption/unlocking logic. It uses a `DefaultManifest()` placeholder for encryption targets.
- **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM - 4:42:37 PM**: A significant refactoring occurred:
    - `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` was removed.
    - `ensureDirectoriesExist` was simplified: it no longer cleans `MigrationDirPath` or creates `RecoveryDirPath`. Directory permissions are now expected to be provided via `common` package constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`), indicating changes in the `directories.go` file (though not explicitly shown in the provided log for `directories.go` itself, only its usage here). A TODO comment suggests these directories should be created during installation.
    - A new function `checkMigrationDirectory` was introduced to explicitly check for and report existing contents in `MigrationDirPath`, preventing overwrites and demanding manual intervention. This replaces the previous implicit cleanup.
    - The error handling for `fscrypt command not found` in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was changed from a fatal error to a logged warning.
    - A minor syntax change in `checkMigrationDirectory` from `var errs []error = ...` to `errs := ...` was observed.
- **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: Error handling in `enableIntegrity` was enhanced. If encryption fails and the result indicates a "Compromised" state (checked via a new `result.Compromised()` method from `fscrypt` package), it attempts to join the existing error with `errIntegrityCompromised`.
- **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: The error handling in `enableIntegrity` was further refined to correctly wrap the error with `errIntegrityCompromised` using `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", errIntegrityCompromised, err)` when a compromise is detected, ensuring proper error propagation.

**3. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
This file, providing `fscrypt` wrappers, underwent substantial evolution in error handling and setup logic.
- **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial version. Defines numerous error constants (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`). It introduces `SetupOnMount` for `fscrypt` setup and the `EncryptionResult` struct to track detailed outcomes of encryption (Success, AlreadyEncrypted, various failures). The `encryptTargetDir` function handled moving contents out, recreating/encrypting the target, and had basic recovery logic involving `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath`.
- **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A significant change was the removal of the `common` package import, implying directory paths like `MigrationDirPath` and `RecoveryDirPath` are no longer directly referenced from `common` in this file. The `FailedToRecover` field and related logic were removed from `EncryptionResult`. The `encryptTargetDir` signature changed to return an `error`, and its internal logic for temporary and recovery directories became hardcoded paths (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/`). Error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` changed to a `switch` statement based on the error returned by `encryptTargetDir`.
- **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM - 4:40:46 PM**: `SetupOnMount` was refactored from an `if` statement to a `switch` statement, distinguishing global setup (`""` or `"/"` mount paths) from specific filesystem setup. The `ErrFailedToRecover` constant and corresponding `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were re-introduced, suggesting a re-evaluation of recovery needs. The `EncryptTargetDirs` error handling for `ErrFailedToRelocate` was expanded to consider partial success.
- **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM - 12:01:27 PM**: A new method `Compromised()` was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct. This method returns `true` if any directories failed to unlock (`len(result.FailedToUnlock) != 0`), providing a specific indicator of integrity violation.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:
- **Security Focus**: The overall purpose is "Config Integrity" with a strong emphasis on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt`, secure key handling (FEMK, `vault.SecureContainer`), and TPM integration.
- **Error Handling Evolution**: There's a clear pattern of refining error handling: from basic logging to returning structured errors (`EncryptionResult`), then to complex error wrapping (`errors.Join`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`) and specific compromise detection.
- **Directory Standardization**: Consistent use of `/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` for various operational and storage needs. The management of these paths (creation, cleanup, permission setting) is a recurring theme.
- **Idempotency**: The code explicitly notes the need for `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` to be idempotent, critical for robust system operations.
- **Logging**: Extensive use of `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warn`, `log.Error` for monitoring and debugging.
- **`afero.Fs`**: The `afero` library is consistently used for abstracting filesystem operations, suggesting testability or flexibility in mind.
- **Future Improvements**: Multiple "TODO" comments indicate ongoing development, particularly around manifest processing, context plumbing, and robust directory cleanup/shredding.
