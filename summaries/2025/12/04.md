# Activity Summary for 12/4/2025

## 12:26:59 AM
The provided code changes detail the ongoing development of an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM integration for key management. The changes span two main periods: November 21, 2025, and December 1-3, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant paths used by the Integrity Handler, including `BootDirPath`, `EncryptedKeyPath` (path to the encrypted FEMK), `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`, and `ManifestDirPath`.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update to the package-level comment, simplifying its description from detailing secure container aspects to generally stating it "contains common globals." The constants themselves remain unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamps: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM**: The initial code establishes core functionalities for verifying the environment (root user, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command presence, TPM initialization), enabling and unlocking encrypted directories, and managing filesystem keys within a secure container. It includes functions like `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getFsKey`, `ensureDirectoriesExist` (with logic to clean migration directories), and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This marks a significant refactoring:
        *   The `os` import is removed, implying a shift towards `afero.Fs` for all filesystem operations and potentially moving permission constants.
        *   Error handling for the `fscrypt` command not being found in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` is changed from returning an error to just logging a warning, which could lead to subsequent failures if `fscrypt` is indeed missing.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function is substantially modified to use permission constants (`common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms`) from the `common` package (implying new constants were defined there, though not shown in the log). The previous logic for cleaning `MigrationDirPath` and creating `RecoveryDirPath` is removed, along with the `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function.
        *   A new function `checkMigrationDirectory` is introduced to proactively detect and error out if the `MigrationDirPath` contains any left-over data, preventing accidental overwrites.
    *   **Timestamps: 12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM - 4:42:37 PM**: Minor syntactic adjustments to the initialization of the error slice in `checkMigrationDirectory`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: The `enableIntegrity` function is updated to incorporate a new `result.Compromised()` method from `fscrypt.EncryptionResult`, allowing it to explicitly join an `errIntegrityCompromised` error if an integrity violation is detected during encryption.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: The error handling in `enableIntegrity` for compromised integrity is refined to explicitly wrap the detailed error with `errIntegrityCompromised` using `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file defines the application's entry point and overall flow. It sets up logging, parses a `mountPath` flag, defines `ExitCode` constants (including `ExitIncompatible` and `ExitCompromised`), calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` (which would later be removed in `integrity.go`), verifies the environment, and orchestrates the `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` processes, mapping internal errors to specific exit codes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initializes the `fscrypt` package with various custom error types (`ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, etc.). It defines `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem-specific fscrypt setup. The `EncryptionResult` struct is introduced to track detailed outcomes of encryption (successes, already encrypted, various failure types). `EncryptTargetDirs` handles the high-level encryption process, calling `encryptTargetDir` which involves relocating contents, recreating the directory, encrypting it, and then attempting to restore contents.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Substantial restructuring:
        *   The `common` package import is temporarily removed, leading to hardcoded paths for temporary directories within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` are explicitly defined.
        *   The `FailedToRecover` field is removed from `EncryptionResult`.
        *   `SetupOnMount` logic is clarified.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` is refactored to handle `encryptTargetDir`'s return values and use a `switch` statement for post-encryption error handling and cleanup (removing temporary directories on success).
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Reversion and further refinement:
        *   The `common` package import is re-added.
        *   `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant and the `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` are re-introduced.
        *   `SetupOnMount` is further refined with a `switch` statement for global vs. specific mount path setup, explicitly stating expectations for upgrade scenarios.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` continues to refine its error handling and recovery logic, now passing `tempDir` as a return value from `encryptTargetDir`.
    *   **Timestamps: 12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM - 12:01:27 PM**: A new method `Compromised()` is added to the `EncryptionResult` struct, specifically returning true if any directories failed to unlock (`FailedToUnlock` list is not empty). This enables precise integrity compromise checks.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Licensing**: All files consistently include the Juniper Networks copyright for 2025.
*   **Emphasis on Security**: The codebase heavily focuses on security, evident through the "Integrity Handler" name, the use of `fscrypt` for encryption, TPM initialization for key protection, the secure handling of keys (e.g., `vault.SecureContainer`, wiping plain keys), and specific error handling for "integrity compromised" states.
*   **Idempotency**: Several functions are explicitly marked as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for reliable, repeatable operations.
*   **Directory Management**: There's a clear pattern of defining and managing specific system directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/`) for integrity-related files, migration stores, and recovery data. The evolution of `ensureDirectoriesExist` and the addition of `checkMigrationDirectory` highlight careful control over these paths and their contents.
*   **Error Handling Evolution**: A continuous pattern of defining more specific error types (e.g., `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`), collecting multiple errors, and refining how these errors are reported and categorized (e.g., `BuildError`, `Failed`, `Compromised` methods) is prominent across `integrity.go` and `fscrypt.go`.
*   **Dependency on `fscrypt`**: The core mechanism for filesystem encryption relies heavily on the `github.com/google/fscrypt` library, including checks for kernel version, fscrypt command presence, and filesystem support.
*   **Standard Go Practices**: Consistent use of `context.Context` for cancellation, `errors.New` for sentinel errors, and `errors.Join` for aggregating errors.
*   **Logging**: The `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` package is consistently used for debugging, informational, and error logging throughout the application.
*   **`afero` for Filesystem Abstraction**: `github.com/spf13/afero` is uniformly used for abstracting filesystem operations, suggesting a focus on testability and flexibility.

## 12:38:06 AM
The provided log contains changes for a single file: `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`.

Given the instruction to not generate summaries for file paths containing keys or sensitive information, the content of `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` is excluded from the summary. This file is typically used to store SSH host keys, which are security-sensitive.

## 1:27:00 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go files within an `IntegrityHandler` application, focusing on secure boot, filesystem encryption using `fscrypt`, and directory management.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file defines constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `/boot/integrity` (BootDirPath), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (EncryptedKeyPath), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (MigrationDirPath), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (RecoveryDirPath), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (ManifestDirPath).
    *   **Minor update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** A comment was updated to clarify the package's role in holding "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." No functional code changes.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Early versions (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM):** These entries show the core `integrity.go` logic, including functions like `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command existence, TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getFsKey`, `ensureDirectoriesExist`, and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`. The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function initially created directories with hardcoded permissions (0o750/0o700) and included logic to clean the `MigrationDirPath`.
    *   **Major Refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM):** This timestamp marks a significant refactor:
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was updated to use directory permissions (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) defined in the `common` package, and the cleanup logic for `MigrationDirPath` was removed. It also stopped creating `RecoveryDirPath`.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was entirely removed.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory()`, was introduced to explicitly check `common.MigrationDirPath` for existing contents and return an error if found, indicating a stricter approach to migration recovery.
        *   Error handling for `exec.LookPath("fscrypt")` in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was changed from returning an error to just logging it.
        *   An attempt to wrap `errIntegrityCompromised` with `errors.Join` was introduced in `enableIntegrity`, though initially with a functional bug (not assigning the joined error).
    *   **Minor Syntax/Bug Fixes (12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM - 12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM):**
        *   A syntactic sugar change from `var errs []error = make(...)` to `errs := make(...)` occurred (12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM).
        *   The bug in `enableIntegrity` where `errors.Join` wasn't assigned was fixed by changing it to `err = fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", errIntegrityCompromised, err)` (12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM).
        *   The `enableIntegrity` function also added a check for `result.Compromised()` (implying a new method in `fscrypt.go`) to appropriately categorize and wrap integrity compromise errors (12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM).

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** This file introduces wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines numerous error constants, the `protectorName` ("FEMK"), `SetupOnMount` for `fscrypt` setup, and the `EncryptionResult` struct with success/failure tracking. It contains `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir`, which uses `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath` for temporary storage and recovery during encryption.
    *   **Temporary Regression/Refactor (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
        *   The `common` package import was *removed*, and `MigrationDirPath` was temporarily replaced with a hardcoded path (`"/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store/"`) in `EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and associated methods (`Failed()`, `BuildError()`) no longer tracked `FailedToRecover`.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature changed to accept `tempDir` as a parameter, and its internal recovery logic was simplified/removed, no longer calling `migrateToRecoveryDir`.
    *   **Re-integration and Refinement (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM):**
        *   The `common` package import was *re-added*.
        *   `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-added as an error constant.
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function was significantly refactored to use a `switch` statement for more robust global vs. filesystem specific setup.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` resumed using `common.MigrationDirPath`.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's return signature was changed to `(string, error)` (returning the `tempDir` path), and its error handling within `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to handle different failure types.
    *   **Feature Addition (12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM):** The `Compromised()` method was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct, indicating if any `FailedToUnlock` errors occurred. This directly supports the updated error handling in `integrity.go`.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM:** Initial definition of common directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM:** Initial structure of the main `IntegrityHandler` logic in `integrity.go`.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM:** Introduction of `main.go` file, defining application entry point, exit codes, and orchestrating `IntegrityHandler` functions.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM:** Initial implementation of `fscrypt.go` with core encryption/decryption wrappers and error handling.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** A notable refactoring in `fscrypt.go` temporarily removed the `common` import and `FailedToRecover` tracking, and altered `encryptTargetDir`'s signature and recovery mechanisms.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM:** Significant changes in `fscrypt.go` where `common` import was re-added, `SetupOnMount` was refactored, and `EncryptTargetDirs`'s error handling and call to `encryptTargetDir` were updated.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM:** Major refactor in `integrity.go` including removal of `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, introduction of `checkMigrationDirectory`, and changes in directory creation and error logging.
*   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM:** `integrity.go` starts using `result.Compromised()` for error handling.
*   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM:** `fscrypt.go` introduces the `Compromised()` method in `EncryptionResult`.
*   **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM:** Final fix for error wrapping in `integrity.go` to correctly associate integrity compromise errors.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright:** All files include the copyright notice `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`, indicating a common ownership and project.
*   **Idempotency Requirement:** Comments frequently mention that functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` "must be idempotent," highlighting a design goal for robust operation.
*   **Error Handling Details:** The use of distinct error variables (`ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `errIntegrityCompromised`, etc.) and the `EncryptionResult` struct demonstrates a comprehensive approach to tracking and reporting granular errors, often joining them into a composite error.
*   **Migration/Recovery Logic Evolution:** There's a clear evolution in how temporary migration directories and recovery scenarios are handled, moving from simpler cleanup/warning mechanisms to more explicit pre-checks and detailed error reporting for integrity violations.
*   **Dependency on `fscrypt` and `tpm`:** The application heavily relies on `github.com/google/fscrypt` for encryption and a `tpm` package (likely for key sealing/unsealing with TPM/vTPM), showing its security-focused nature.
*   **Use of `afero.Fs`:** The `afero` library is consistently used for filesystem operations, which is good practice for testability (allowing in-memory or mock filesystems).
*   **Log Usage:** Extensive use of a custom `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) for debugging, info, warning, and error messages throughout the code.
*   **Repeated Code Snapshots:** Many consecutive timestamps for the same file show identical code, suggesting frequent saves or commits without functional changes, which can obscure the actual development flow in a raw log.

## 1:38:05 AM
The provided log details changes to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`. This file contains sensitive information related to SSH host keys, including public keys for various servers and IP addresses. As per instructions, content from files potentially storing keys will not be summarized.

## 2:26:54 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go source files within an `IntegrityHandler` application.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
On 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM, this file defined constants for various directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` for boot files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted FEMK (File Encryption Master Key), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` for migration data, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` for recovery data, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` for manifest files. A minor documentation change occurred on 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM, updating the package comment to better describe its role as containing common globals.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
The initial significant version of this file, seen at 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM, implements core Integrity Handler logic. It includes functions for `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, filesystem encryption support via `fscrypt`, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (which ensures directories exist, creates/decrypts FEMK, sets up `fscrypt`, and encrypts target directories), `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getFsKey`, and `ensureDirectoriesExist`. The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function at this point manually sets directory permissions and attempts to clean the migration directory. A `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was also present. Several subsequent timestamps (11/21/2025, 2:27:22 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM; 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM) show no functional changes, likely representing re-saves or minor non-code commits.

A major refactoring occurred on 12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM. The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was updated to use permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) instead of hardcoded values, implying these constants were introduced elsewhere. This function also removed its internal logic for cleaning the migration path and creating the recovery directory. The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed entirely. A new `checkMigrationDirectory` function was introduced, which checks for existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath` and returns an error if found, preventing data overwrites. Error handling in `enableIntegrity` was enhanced to check for a new `Compromised()` method on `fscrypt.EncryptionResult` to specifically wrap integrity compromise errors. The `fscrypt` command lookup now logs an error but doesn't immediately exit. Subsequent timestamps (12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:41:11 PM; 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM) show only minor syntactic changes or re-saves. Finally, on 12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM, the error handling in `enableIntegrity` was slightly adjusted for clarity when joining compromised errors.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
This file was introduced on 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM. It defines the application's entry point, `main()`, and an `ExitCode` enum for standardized process return values, including `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations. The `run()` function orchestrates the application flow, handling environment verification and calling `enableIntegrity` and `unlockEncryptedDirs` from `integrity.go`. It also includes logic to handle different exit codes based on the outcome of integrity operations.

**File: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
On 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM, this file was introduced, providing high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defined numerous error constants related to encryption, a `protectorName` ("FEMK"), and a `SetupOnMount` function. The `EncryptionResult` struct was introduced to track the success or various failure states (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, recovery) of directory encryption. The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions outline the process of moving existing contents, creating an empty target directory, encrypting it, and then moving contents back. The `encryptTargetDir` initially handled partial recovery logic.

Significant changes occurred on 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM. The import of the `common` package was removed, as was the `FailedToRecover` field from `EncryptionResult` and the `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to handle errors from `encryptTargetDir` more explicitly using a `switch` statement and to clean up temporary migration directories on success. The `tempDir` variable's path became hardcoded temporarily.

On 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM, the `common` package import, `FailedToRecover` field, and `ErrFailedToRecover` constant were all re-added, reverting the previous removal. The `SetupOnMount` function was refactored with a `switch` statement to handle global setup for empty or root mount paths and filesystem-specific setup for others. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's error handling for `ErrFailedToRelocate` was expanded to include `recoveryErr` logic. Multiple subsequent timestamps on 12/1/2025 (4:37:36 PM; 4:40:23 PM; 4:40:46 PM) show no functional changes. A key functional addition on 12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM, was the `Compromised()` method to `EncryptionResult`, specifically indicating if any directories failed to unlock, signifying an integrity breach. Other timestamps on 12/3/2025 (11:58:36 AM; 11:59:04 AM; 11:59:18 AM; 12:00:46 PM; 12:01:27 PM) also reflect no functional changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Copyrights:** All files consistently start with the Juniper Networks copyright for 2025.
*   **Integrity Handler Core:** The code heavily focuses on a Go application named "Integrity Handler" designed for securing file systems through encryption using `fscrypt`.
*   **Key Management:** There's a strong emphasis on handling a "FEMK" (File Encryption Master Key) securely, involving a `vault.SecureContainer` and TPM (Trusted Platform Module) initialization.
*   **Directory Management:** Specific directories like `/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` are central to the application's operation, used for storing keys, migration data, recovery data, and manifests respectively.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code uses numerous custom error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), `errors.Join` for aggregating multiple errors, and a detailed `EncryptionResult` struct to provide granular feedback on the encryption process. The concept of "integrity compromised" is explicitly handled and reported.
*   **Idempotency:** Functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be safely run multiple times without unintended side effects.
*   **System Requirements:** The `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` function consistently checks for specific system requirements such as root privileges, kernel version, and filesystem encryption support.
*   **Iterative Development with Refactoring:** The log shows an initial burst of feature implementation (11/21), followed by significant refactoring and error handling enhancements (12/1), and then minor refinements (12/3). The repeated saves/commits without functional changes indicate an active development cycle.
*   **TODO Comments:** Numerous `TODO` comments highlight areas for future improvements, particularly regarding idempotent flows, error recovery, and directory permission management during installation.

## 2:38:06 AM
The provided log includes changes to the file `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`. As this file is an SSH `known_hosts` file and stores cryptographic keys, a summary will not be generated in accordance with the instruction to avoid summarizing files that may store keys or sensitive information.

## 3:27:02 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go source files in the `IntegrityHandler` application, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity management.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of constants for key directory paths, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`. The package comment mentions a "secure container to hold our key at runtime."
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor update to the package comment, changing it to "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM**: Initial implementation of core integrity logic. This includes:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata`), presence of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates directory creation, FEMK resolution, filesystem key retrieval, fscrypt setup, and target directory encryption.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking of encrypted directories, reporting `errIntegrityCompromised` on failure.
        *   `getFsKey`: Manages the lazy-loading and secure container placement of the filesystem key.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates various integrity-related directories with specific permissions and includes logic to clean the migration directory.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if content is found in the recovery directory.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Significant refactoring occurred:
        *   The `os` import was removed as `os.FileMode` usage was replaced by external constants.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was updated to use `common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, and `common.BootDirPerms` (implying these were added to `common/directories.go`). The logic for cleaning `MigrationDirPath` and creating `RecoveryDirPath` was removed from this function. A `TODO` comment suggested these directories should be created during installation.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
        *   A new `checkMigrationDirectory` function was added to ensure the migration directory is empty before use, preventing data overwrites from previous failed attempts.
        *   Error handling for `exec.LookPath("fscrypt")` changed from returning an error to logging a warning.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` (simplified `var errs []error = ...` to `errs := ...`).
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: The `enableIntegrity` function's error handling was enhanced to specifically check for "compromised" states (`result.Compromised()`) and wrap the `errIntegrityCompromised` error accordingly. This relies on a new `Compromised()` method from `fscrypt.EncryptionResult`.
    *   **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: Further refinement in `enableIntegrity`'s compromised error handling, explicitly reassigning `err` to include `errIntegrityCompromised` as a wrapped error using `fmt.Errorf`.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of fscrypt wrappers. This included:
        *   Defining numerous error types related to encryption and directory operations.
        *   `protectorName` constant set to "FEMK".
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Handles global and mount-specific fscrypt setup.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: Tracks successful, already encrypted, and various failed operations (relocation, encryption, unlock, restore, recovery).
        *   `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods for aggregating and reporting failures.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Orchestrates the encryption of target directories.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`: Contains the detailed logic for relocating contents, creating an empty target, encrypting, and handling recovery on failure, utilizing `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath`.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Changes related to error definitions and `common` package dependency:
        *   New explicit error variables (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added.
        *   The `common` package import was temporarily removed.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its `Failed()`/`BuildError()` methods were updated to remove tracking for `FailedToRecover`.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function had its temporary directory path hardcoded instead of using `common.MigrationDirPath`. Error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` was modified to use a `switch` statement for logging different failure types.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Reverted some previous changes and introduced structural improvements:
        *   The `common` package import was re-added.
        *   `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-added.
        *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored with a `switch` statement to clearly distinguish between global (`""`, `/`) and filesystem-specific setup. Comments clarify assumptions about upgrade scenarios.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct and its `Failed()`/`BuildError()` methods were updated to re-include `FailedToRecover` tracking.
        *   The error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to correctly assign `target` to appropriate failure slices and introduced a `recoveryErr` variable for more robust recovery attempts.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: A new method `Compromised()` was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct, returning `true` if any directories failed to unlock. This explicitly flags integrity compromises.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file was introduced, serving as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised), parses a mount path argument, sets up logging, and orchestrates the calls to `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It maps internal errors to the defined `ExitCode` values.

*   **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: `integrity.go` refines how compromised errors are wrapped and returned.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright**: All files consistently use a 2025 Juniper Networks copyright header.
*   **Go Language Conventions**: Adherence to standard Go practices including package declarations, imports, `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf` for error wrapping, and `errors.Join` for combining errors.
*   **Integrity and Encryption Focus**: The entire codebase is dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" application that uses `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, interacts with TPM, and manages encryption keys (FEMK).
*   **Directory-Based Operations**: Heavy reliance on specific directory paths for storing integrity manifests, migration data, recovery data, and encrypted keys.
*   **Idempotency**: Explicit comments indicate that core functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are designed to be idempotent.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: A detailed `EncryptionResult` struct tracks various success and failure states, and methods like `Failed()` and `BuildError()` provide a comprehensive overview of operation outcomes. The specific `ErrIntegrityCompromised` and `Compromised()` method highlight a critical security concern.
*   **Logging**: Extensive use of `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warn`, `log.Error` for detailed operational logging and error reporting.
*   **Virtual Filesystem (afero)**: The use of `github.com/spf13/afero` suggests a design choice to abstract filesystem operations, potentially for easier testing or cross-platform compatibility.

The provided log entry is for the file `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`. This file stores cryptographic keys of SSH servers the user has connected to, making it a sensitive file that could store keys. As per your instructions, summaries will not be generated for file paths containing keys or similar sensitive information.

## 4:27:08 AM
The provided logs detail changes across key Go source files for an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focused on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and secure key management.

**File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initialized with constants defining essential directory paths for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (BootDirPath), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (EncryptedKeyPath), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (MigrationDirPath), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (RecoveryDirPath), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (ManifestDirPath).
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor textual update to the package comment, changing its description from "secure container to hold our key" to "contains common globals." No functional code changes were introduced at this point.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM)**: This file contained the core logic for environment verification, enabling integrity, unlocking encrypted directories, and managing the filesystem key. It included functions to check system requirements (root user, kernel version >= 5.4, fscrypt support, TPM initialization) and create necessary directories. Directory creation involved hardcoded permissions and explicit cleaning of the migration directory, alongside a function `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` to alert about contents in the recovery directory.
    *   **Significant Refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM)**:
        *   The `os` package import was removed, indicating a refinement in dependencies or how `os`-related operations are handled.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was streamlined. It removed direct handling of `RecoveryDirPath` creation and the logic for cleaning `MigrationDirPath`. Crucially, directory permissions for `MigrationDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, and `BootDirPath` were externalized to new constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`), implying additions to the `common/directories.go` file (not explicitly shown in this log sequence but necessary for compilation).
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced. Its purpose is to explicitly check if the `MigrationDirPath` contains any residual files, returning an error if it's not empty, thus enforcing a clean state before new migration attempts.
    *   **Minor Syntax Update (12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM)**: A minor stylistic change, replacing `var errs []error = make` with `errs := make` in `checkMigrationDirectory`.
    *   **Enhanced Error Handling (12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM)**: The `enableIntegrity` function's error handling was refined. It now leverages a new `Compromised()` method (introduced in `fscrypt.go`) on the `EncryptionResult` to specifically identify and explicitly join the `errIntegrityCompromised` error with other errors when an integrity violation is detected.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM)**: This file provided high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations, defining numerous error constants for various failure scenarios. It included `SetupOnMount` for configuring `fscrypt` globally and on specific mount points. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracked encryption outcomes, though its `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods didn't consistently include all defined error types (e.g., `FailedToRecover` was in the struct but excluded from checks). The `encryptTargetDir` function handled temporary data migration, using concatenated string paths (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPath + "/" + dirName`) rather than `filepath.Join`.
    *   **Temporary Decoupling and Subsequent Recoupling of `common` (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM to 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM)**:
        *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: The `common` package import was *removed*. This led to hardcoded paths for temporary directories within `EncryptTargetDirs`. Error constant `ErrFailedToRecover` was removed from the `EncryptionResult` struct and its related error handling. `encryptTargetDir` was refactored to return `tempDir` and `error`, and no longer directly updated the `EncryptionResult` or managed recovery directories. `SetupOnMount` was also simplified.
        *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: The `common` package was *re-imported*, and `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-introduced as an error constant. `SetupOnMount` was refactored again, adopting a `switch` statement for different mount path scenarios. `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to process the `tempDir, err` returned from `encryptTargetDir`, re-introducing logic for handling recovery (though the full implementation isn't shown). Notably, even after re-introducing `ErrFailedToRecover`, `EncryptionResult.Failed()` and `BuildError()` still did not consistently include it.
    *   **Introduction of `Compromised()` Method (12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM)**: A new `Compromised()` method was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct. This method specifically checks if `len(result.FailedToUnlock) != 0`, providing a dedicated flag for integrity violations, which is then utilized by `integrity.go` for more precise error classification.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Initial and Only Recorded Change (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM)**: This file defines the main entry point and the `run` function for the Integrity Handler application. It handles argument parsing (e.g., `--mount` path), initializes logging, and orchestrates the sequence of operations: calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` (which was later removed in `integrity.go`), `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It defines custom `ExitCode` constants, including `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations, to provide detailed process return values.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notices**: All files consistently include the copyright `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`
*   **Focus on Integrity and Encryption**: The entire codebase is dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" application that utilizes `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, integrates with TPM for key security, and manages various related directories for migration, recovery, and manifests.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: The code heavily relies on custom error types, `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` for error wrapping, and `errors.Join` for aggregating multiple errors, indicating a strong emphasis on detailed and structured error reporting.
*   **Directory Management**: There's a recurring pattern of defining, creating, and managing specific application directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`), often with precise permission requirements. The evolution shows a move from inline permission setting to using constants from the `common` package.
*   **Idempotency Requirement**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly noted as needing to be idempotent, which is crucial for reliability in system-level operations.
*   **Security Consciousness**: The use of `vault.SecureContainer` and the explicit wiping of plaintext keys after use (`plainKey[i] = 0`) highlight a strong focus on security best practices for handling sensitive cryptographic material (FEMK).
*   **Logging**: Consistent use of a custom logging package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) is observed across all files for debugging, informational, warning, and error messages.
*   **Refinement and Evolution**: The log shows a continuous refinement of the codebase, particularly in error reporting mechanisms (e.g., `EncryptionResult` updates, `Compromised()` method) and directory handling, suggesting an iterative development process. The temporary removal and re-addition of the `common` package in `fscrypt.go` indicates periods of architectural re-evaluation.

However, as per the instructions, a summary for file paths containing keys or sensitive information, like the `.ssh/known_hosts` file, will not be generated.

## 5:26:58 AM
The provided log details changes across three Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, focusing on file system encryption and integrity management. Key updates occurred on November 21, 2025, and between December 1-3, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defined common directory paths for the Integrity Handler, including those for boot files, encrypted keys, migration data, recovery data, and manifest files.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor comment update was made, clarifying the package's purpose as containing "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The defined paths remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM**: Initial and repeated entries show the core logic. This file implements environment verification (checking root, kernel version, fscrypt support, TPM initialization), directory creation, FEMK (File Encryption Master Key) resolution, and the main functions for enabling and unlocking integrity-protected directories. It defines `errIntegrityCompromised` and functions like `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getFsKey`, `ensureDirectoriesExist`, and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Significant refactoring occurred:
        *   The `os` import was removed.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was updated to use constants for permissions (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) instead of hardcoded values, and its internal logic for cleaning migration/recovery paths was removed. The creation of `RecoveryDirPath` was also removed from this function.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was added. This function verifies if the migration directory contains any residual data from a previous failed attempt, preventing overwrites.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: A minor syntax correction was applied in `checkMigrationDirectory` (`var errs []error = make` changed to `errs := make`).
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: The `enableIntegrity` function's error handling was refined to leverage a new `Compromised()` method from `EncryptionResult`, allowing for specific error wrapping with `errIntegrityCompromised` if an integrity violation is detected during encryption.
    *   **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: The error wrapping logic in `enableIntegrity` was further corrected to use `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, ensuring proper error chain preservation.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the main application entry point. It defines custom `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for process return values. The `main` function parses a mount path, sets logging, and calls the `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the initialization, environment checks, integrity enabling, and unlocking of directories, mapping internal errors to the appropriate `ExitCode`, including `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of high-level fscrypt wrappers. It defines numerous error types related to fscrypt operations (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), a `protectorName` constant ("FEMK"), and the `SetupOnMount` function for global and filesystem fscrypt setup. The `EncryptionResult` struct was introduced to track success and various failure categories during directory encryption (e.g., `FailedToRelocate`, `FailedToEncrypt`, `FailedToUnlock`). It also contains `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions. At this stage, `FailedToRecover` was part of the struct but not fully integrated into `BuildError`.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: This update involved a temporary removal of the `common` package import and `ErrFailedToRecover` definition. The `EncryptionResult` struct was also modified to remove `FailedToRecover`, and the `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated accordingly. The `encryptTargetDir` function signature was changed to accept `tempDir` as an argument, and internal paths were temporarily hardcoded.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: This change largely reversed some of the previous removals, re-importing `common` and re-adding `ErrFailedToRecover` as a defined error and to the `EncryptionResult` struct. However, `Failed()` and `BuildError()` still did not account for `FailedToRecover`. The `SetupOnMount` function was significantly refactored to use a `switch` statement for clearer handling of global versus specific mount path setups. The `encryptTargetDir` function's signature was changed back to return `tempDir` and an error, indicating a shift towards caller-managed error handling and cleanup in `EncryptTargetDirs`.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: A new method, `Compromised() bool`, was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct. This method specifically checks if any directories failed to unlock, indicating an integrity compromise.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Integrity and Encryption Focus**: All changes revolve around establishing and maintaining data integrity through filesystem encryption using `fscrypt`, often involving a FEMK.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: A consistent theme is the detailed classification and aggregation of errors using the `EncryptionResult` struct and custom error types, leading to specific exit codes for application failure or integrity compromise.
*   **Directory-Based Operations**: The code consistently manages specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`) for various functions like storage, migration, and recovery. Permissions are explicitly set.
*   **Idempotency**: The application emphasizes idempotency for core operations like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` to ensure consistent behavior across multiple runs.
*   **Environment Prerequisites**: Strict environmental checks (root user, kernel version, filesystem encryption capabilities, fscrypt command availability, TPM initialization) are performed before proceeding with integrity operations.
*   **Refactoring and Code Quality**: There are patterns of code refactoring, especially in error handling logic (`EncryptionResult` methods, error joining) and function signatures (`encryptTargetDir`), suggesting continuous improvement in robustness and maintainability.
*   **Comment-Driven Development**: `TODO` comments are frequently used to indicate planned future improvements or areas needing further attention, such as best-effort shredding or handling upgrade use cases.
