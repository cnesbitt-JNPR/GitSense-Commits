# Activity Summary for 12/7/2025

## 12:27:08 AM
The provided log details the evolution of an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity. Key information includes:

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant paths for the Integrity Handler's operations, including `/boot/integrity` (`BootDirPath`), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (`EncryptedKeyPath`), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (`MigrationDirPath`), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (`RecoveryDirPath`), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (`ManifestDirPath`). The package comment highlights the use of a secure container for keys at runtime.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was slightly rephrased for clarity, but the defined directory paths remain unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM)**: Establishes the core application logic. It includes `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` to check system requirements (root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, fscrypt support, fscrypt command presence, TPM initialization). `enableIntegrity` handles the encryption process, including directory creation, FEMK (Filesystem Encryption Master Key) resolution, fscrypt setup, and target directory encryption. `unlockEncryptedDirs` handles unlocking. `getFsKey` securely retrieves the filesystem key, wiping it from memory after use. `ensureDirectoriesExist` sets up necessary paths, initially including logic to clean the migration directory and create a recovery directory. `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` checks for leftover recovery data. A minor change on **11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM** removed the `afero.Exists` check in `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, leading to a direct `ReadDir` call and a potentially flawed warning message logic.
    *   **Major Refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM - 4:42:37 PM)**:
        *   The failure to find the `fscrypt` command during environment verification was downgraded from a fatal error to a logged warning.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was significantly simplified, removing internal cleanup and hardcoded permissions, instead relying on new, unshown `common` constants (`MigrationDirPerms`, `ManifestDirPerms`, `BootDirPerms`). The creation of `RecoveryDirPath` was removed from this function.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed entirely.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced to explicitly check for and error on existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath` to prevent data loss.
        *   Minor syntax improvements for slice initialization.
    *   **Error Handling Refinement (12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM - 2:04:54 PM)**: Modified the `enableIntegrity` function to correctly wrap the `errIntegrityCompromised` error when `EncryptionResult` indicates a compromised state, ensuring accurate error reporting.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Initial commit of the main application entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants, embeds the version string, parses command-line flags (specifically `-mount`), and orchestrates the application flow by calling `run()`. The `run()` function calls the `IntegrityHandler`'s core functions, handling various exit codes based on success, environment incompatibility, or integrity compromise. It initially calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings()`, which was later removed from `integrity.go`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM)**: Defines high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. Includes numerous custom error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), the `protectorName` constant "FEMK", and the `SetupOnMount` function for global and filesystem setup. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks detailed outcomes of encryption attempts, including `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, and various `FailedTo...` categories. `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` implement the core encryption and data migration logic. `encryptTargetDir` initially took `*EncryptionResult` as an argument.
    *   **Refactor & `common` Removal/Re-addition (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM)**:
        *   On **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**, `FailedToRecover` was removed from `EncryptionResult` struct and its related methods. Crucially, the `common` package import was temporarily removed, leading to hardcoded paths in `EncryptTargetDirs`. The `encryptTargetDir` function signature changed to return `(string, error)`, shifting error categorization to the caller.
        *   On **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**, the `common` import was re-added. The `ErrFailedToRecover` error variable was reintroduced (though not yet added back to the `EncryptionResult` struct). `SetupOnMount` was enhanced with a `switch` statement for more flexible global vs. specific mount point setup, specifically for upgrade scenarios.
    *   **Compromise Tracking (12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM - 12:01:27 PM)**: A `Compromised()` method was added to `EncryptionResult`, returning `true` if `FailedToUnlock` contains any entries, providing a specific flag for integrity breaches.
    *   **Cleanup Error Handling (12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM - 9:57:01 AM)**:
        *   On **12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM**, `ErrFailedToClean` was introduced as a new error type for post-encryption cleanup failures.
        *   On **12/4/2025, 9:44:40 AM**, `FailedToClean` was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct and incorporated into the `Failed()` method calculation.
        *   On **12/4/2025, 9:47:07 AM**, `BuildError()` was updated to include `FailedToClean` in the composite error message.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/migration.go`**
    *   **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: This new file was introduced to encapsulate directory and file migration utilities. It defines `createNameForTargetDir` to generate unique names (using SHA256 hash), and various `move` functions (`moveIntoDir`, `moveWithDirOverwrite`, `optimizedMove`, `moveWithRsync`). These functions manage file relocation, prioritizing `os.Rename` for efficiency and falling back to `rsync` for robustness across partitions.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial core logic for Integrity Handler (environment checks, encryption flow, error handling).
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of the `main.go` entry point.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial `fscrypt` package implementation for encryption.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactor in `fscrypt.go`, temporary removal of `common` import and `FailedToRecover`, change in `encryptTargetDir`'s error handling strategy.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Re-introduction of `common` import and `ErrFailedToRecover` (as error variable), and improved `SetupOnMount` logic in `fscrypt.go`. Major simplification of `ensureDirectoriesExist` and introduction of `checkMigrationDirectory` in `integrity.go`.
*   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: Addition of `Compromised()` method to `EncryptionResult` in `fscrypt.go`.
*   **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: Correction in `enableIntegrity` error handling in `integrity.go` for compromised states.
*   **12/4/2025, 9:44:40 AM**: `FailedToClean` added to `EncryptionResult` struct and its methods in `fscrypt.go`.
*   **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: Introduction of `migration.go` for dedicated file movement utilities.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security and Integrity Focus**: The entire codebase, named "Integrity Handler," is dedicated to ensuring filesystem integrity through encryption (`fscrypt`), TPM integration, and robust error handling that flags "integrity compromised" states.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: A consistent pattern of defining specific error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`) and collecting them into an `EncryptionResult` struct is evident across `integrity.go` and `fscrypt.go`. This allows for detailed reporting of partial successes and failures. The `BuildError()` method for `EncryptionResult` aggregates these specific errors into a comprehensive message.
*   **Idempotency**: Several functions, explicitly `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without unintended side effects, crucial for system reliability.
*   **Directory Management and Permissions**: There's a strong emphasis on managing specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/...`) with defined permissions and dedicated functions (`ensureDirectoriesExist`, `checkMigrationDirectory`). There's a clear move towards centralizing directory path and permission definitions in the `common` package.
*   **External Tool Integration**: The application relies on external tools like `fscrypt` (both as a Go library and a command-line utility) and `rsync` for core functionality, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to leveraging existing, robust tools.
*   **Iterative Development**: The log shows a clear progression from initial setup to refactoring, adding more granular error handling, and modularizing code into new files (`migration.go`). The frequent, small changes within a short period (late November to early December 2025) suggest active development and refinement.

## 2:26:57 AM
The code changes primarily revolve around an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM/vTPM integration.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
*   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM)**: Defined constants for critical directory paths, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted key), migration paths (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`), and manifest paths (`/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`).
*   **Minor comment update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM)**: The package comment was clarified from describing a secure container to stating it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." No functional change.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
*   **Initial development (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM)**: Introduced core functions for verifying the environment (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), enabling and unlocking integrity (`enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`), retrieving the filesystem key (`getFsKey`), ensuring necessary directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`), and handling recovery warnings (`handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`). Environment verification includes checks for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), and filesystem encryption support via `fscrypt`.
*   **Significant Refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM)**:
    *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was streamlined. It removed the internal `perms` variable, opting instead to use permission constants (`common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms`) which implies these constants were added to the `common` package (though not explicitly shown in the `directories.go` log entries).
    *   The logic for cleaning the migration directory and creating the recovery directory was removed from `ensureDirectoriesExist`.
    *   A new function `checkMigrationDirectory` was introduced to explicitly check for and error on existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath`, preventing potential data loss from failed prior migrations.
    *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was entirely removed.
    *   Error logging for `fscrypt` command lookup was changed from returning an error to logging it.
*   **Minor fix (12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM)**: A minor syntax update in `checkMigrationDirectory` for declaring the `errs` slice.
*   **Error Handling Enhancement (12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM)**: The error handling in `enableIntegrity` was enhanced to check if an `EncryptionResult` indicates a "compromised" state (implying a new `Compromised()` method on `EncryptionResult` in `fscrypt.go`), and if so, it will join the resulting error with `errIntegrityCompromised`.
*   **Error Wrapping Correction (12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM)**: In `enableIntegrity`, the error joining for compromised state was corrected from `errors.Join(err, errIntegrityCompromised)` to `err = fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", errIntegrityCompromised, err)` for proper error wrapping.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
*   **Initial implementation (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM)**: Defined `ExitCode` constants for different application exit statuses (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised). The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path argument, and calls `run`. The `run` function orchestrates the Integrity Handler's workflow, including version logging, environment verification, calling `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, with specific exit codes based on the outcome (e.g., `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations).

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
*   **Initial development (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM)**: Introduced high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. Defined numerous error variables for specific failure conditions (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`). It included `SetupOnMount` for `fscrypt` global and filesystem setup, and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track outcomes of encryption attempts. The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions began to define the encryption workflow.
*   **Error Granularity & `EncryptionResult` Refinement (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM)**:
    *   New explicit error variables `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were defined.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated to include these new, more granular failure types. `FailedToRecover` was removed from `EncryptionResult` fields.
    *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function gained a `switch` statement for improved error handling from `encryptTargetDir`, including success cleanup logic.
    *   *Brief removal then re-addition of `common` package import:* The `common` package import was temporarily removed in this change but restored in the next.
*   **`SetupOnMount` Logic Enhancement (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM)**:
    *   The `common` package import was restored.
    *   A new error variable `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-added.
    *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored with a `switch` statement to differentiate between global setup (for mount paths like "" or "/") and filesystem-specific setup, clarifying the expected setup flow during upgrades.
    *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to capture `tempDir` and `err` from `encryptTargetDir` for more detailed error handling.
*   **Added `Compromised()` Method (12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM)**: A new `Compromised()` method was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct, returning `true` if `FailedToUnlock` contains any entries. This directly supports the updated error handling in `integrity.go`.
*   **Added `ErrFailedToClean` and Tracking (12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM)**:
    *   A new error variable `ErrFailedToClean` was added, specifically for failures in removing temporary migration directories after successful encryption.
    *   `EncryptionResult` was updated to include a `FailedToClean []string` field.
    *   The `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated to incorporate this new failure type.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/migration.go`**
*   **Initial implementation (12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM)**: This file was introduced to encapsulate directory migration logic. It provides functions to:
    *   `createNameForTargetDir`: Generate a unique, hash-based name for a temporary directory.
    *   `moveIntoDir`: Move contents from a source to a destination, with options to error if the destination is not empty.
    *   `moveWithDirOverwrite`: A more robust move function that attempts an `optimizedMove` (using `os.Rename`) first, falling back to `moveWithRsync` if the optimized move fails or if the destination needs to be cleared (by removing it first if not empty).
    *   `optimizedMove`: Uses `os.Rename` for efficient moves within the same partition.
    *   `moveWithRsync`: Uses `rsync` for more robust, cross-partition file transfers.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:
*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial structure of `integrity.go` with core environment checks and encryption enablement functions.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of `main.go` with application entry point, exit codes, and high-level flow.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial `fscrypt.go` with error definitions, setup, and encryption result tracking.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: `fscrypt.go` refines error handling, introduces more granular error types, and updates `EncryptionResult`.

*   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: `fscrypt.go` adds `Compromised()` method to `EncryptionResult`, directly impacting `integrity.go`'s error handling for compromised states.
*   **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: `integrity.go` corrects error wrapping for compromised states.
*   **12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM**: `fscrypt.go` introduces `ErrFailedToClean` and integrates cleanup failures into `EncryptionResult` reporting.
*   **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: Introduction of `migration.go` to centralize and refine file movement logic using `os.Rename` and `rsync`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:
*   **Copyright Notice**: All files begin with the same Juniper Networks copyright notice, dated 2025.
*   **Juniper SSN Context**: Imports like `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` indicate the code is part of the Juniper SSN project.
*   **Security and Integrity Focus**: The entire codebase is dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" that manages encrypted directories (FEMK, fscrypt), utilizes TPM/vTPM, and meticulously tracks various failure modes related to encryption and data integrity.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: A significant portion of the changes involves defining specific error types, wrapping errors (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, `errors.Join`), and creating a detailed `EncryptionResult` struct to provide granular feedback on the success or failure of encryption operations.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: Consistent use of `github.com/spf13/afero` for filesystem operations, likely for testability and portability.
*   **Idempotency**: Multiple functions are explicitly commented as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for reliable, repeatable operations.
*   **Migration/Recovery Workflow**: There's a clear pattern of migrating directory contents out, performing an operation (like encryption), and then migrating contents back, with built-in recovery and cleanup considerations. The evolution shows increasing sophistication in handling partial failures and ensuring data integrity during these migrations.
*   **TODO Comments**: Numerous "TODO" comments indicate ongoing development or future enhancements, particularly around idempotent flows, context plumbing, processing manifests, and directory creation during installation.

## 3:27:02 AM
The code changes log primarily details the evolution of an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption, directory management, and robust error handling. The changes occurred between November 21, 2025, and December 5, 2025.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially established to define various critical directory paths as constants for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity` (BootDirPath), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (EncryptedKeyPath), and paths under `/opt/128technology/integrity` for migration, recovery, and manifests.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor textual change was made to the package comment, clarifying that the package "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM**: Initial iterations introduced the core logic for the Integrity Handler. This includes `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root, kernel version, fscrypt support, TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (for setting up fscrypt and encrypting directories), `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getFsKey` (for secure key handling), `ensureDirectoriesExist` (creating migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with specific permissions and attempting to clean the migration directory), and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Significant changes were introduced:
        *   The error handling for a missing `fscrypt` command in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was softened; it now logs an error but no longer prevents initialization.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was refactored. Hardcoded permissions (e.g., `0o750`) were replaced with references to constants from the `common` package (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`), indicating a move towards centralized permission management.
        *   The logic to clean `MigrationDirPath` was removed from `ensureDirectoriesExist`.
        *   The `RecoveryDirPath` was removed from `ensureDirectoriesExist`, as its presence was implicitly handled by the new `checkMigrationDirectory` function.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was completely replaced by `checkMigrationDirectory`, which now strictly checks for any content in `common.MigrationDirPath` and returns an error to prevent overwriting previous recovery data.
        *   A `TODO` comment was added, suggesting that directory creation should ideally be part of the installation process.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM - 4:42:37 PM**: Minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` (`var errs []error = ...` to `errs := ...`).
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM - 2:04:54 PM**: The `enableIntegrity` function's error handling was enhanced. It now specifically checks if an encryption failure result indicates a `Compromised()` state (i.e., directories failed to unlock) and explicitly joins `errIntegrityCompromised` with the general build error, providing more specific integrity violation reporting.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This new file introduces the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) aligned with systemd service return codes. The `main` function parses command-line arguments, sets up logging, and calls the `run` function, which orchestrates the environment verification, directory handling, integrity enablement, and unlocking. It also maps errors from integrity operations to the appropriate `ExitCode`, particularly returning `ExitCompromised` for `errIntegrityCompromised`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial version of the fscrypt wrapper. It defines numerous custom error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), sets a `protectorName` to "FEMK", implements `SetupOnMount` for fscrypt initialization, and introduces the `EncryptionResult` struct to track encryption outcomes (success, already encrypted, various failures including `FailedToRecover`). It also outlines `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` for managing the encryption and migration of directory contents, including provisional recovery steps.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Substantial rework of error handling and dependencies.
        *   The import for the `common` package was temporarily removed, leading to hardcoded paths for migration.
        *   Several error definitions were added for more granular tracking (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`).
        *   The `FailedToRecover` field was removed from `EncryptionResult`, and its logic was streamlined in `EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function's return signature was changed, and `EncryptTargetDirs` now uses a `switch` statement to handle specific errors from `encryptTargetDir` and perform cleanup of temporary directories on success.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Reverted some of the `11/25/2025` changes.
        *   The `common` package import was re-added.
        *   The `ErrFailedToRecover` error and the `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were reintroduced.
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function was refactored to use a `switch` statement for better handling of global vs. specific mount path setups, with comments clarifying upgrade scenarios.
        *   The error handling logic in `EncryptTargetDirs` for `ErrFailedToRelocate` was expanded to include `recoveryErr` and `moveContentsToRecoveryDir`, indicating a more robust recovery process.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: A new `Compromised()` method was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct, specifically checking if `len(result.FailedToUnlock) != 0` to provide a clear indicator of integrity violations.
    *   **12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM**: A new error `ErrFailedToClean` was introduced, along with a `FailedToClean` field in `EncryptionResult`, and its inclusion in `newEncryptionResult`, `Failed()`, and `BuildError()`. This change indicates the addition of tracking for failures during the cleanup of temporary migration directories after successful encryption.
    *   **12/4/2025, 9:45:00 AM - 4:07:12 PM**: Minor updates and consistency fixes related to the initialization of `FailedToClean` in `newEncryptionResult`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/migration.go`**
    *   **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: This new file was introduced, containing utility functions for safely moving directory contents during the encryption process. Key functions include `createNameForTargetDir` (generates a unique hash-based name), `moveIntoDir` (moves contents with checks for empty destination), `moveWithDirOverwrite` (attempts `os.Rename` for efficiency, falls back to `rsync`, and handles existing destination directories), `optimizedMove` (simple rename), and `moveWithRsync` (robust cross-partition move using rsync).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Copyright Year Consistency**: All files consistently use a 2025 copyright, indicating a new or recently updated project.
2.  **Modular Design**: The `IntegrityHandler` is broken down into `common`, `fscrypt`, `tpm`, `vault`, and `main` packages, suggesting a clean separation of concerns.
3.  **Extensive Error Handling**: A significant pattern is the detailed error reporting and recovery mechanisms. Custom error types are used heavily, and `EncryptionResult` centrally aggregates multiple failure states across complex operations. The repeated addition and refinement of error states and recovery paths highlight a focus on robustness.
4.  **Filesystem Operations with `afero`**: The `afero.Fs` interface is consistently used for filesystem operations, indicating an abstraction layer for testing and flexibility (e.g., using an in-memory filesystem).
5.  **Idempotency Goal**: Several functions are explicitly marked as "idempotent," a crucial design principle for operations that might be retried or run multiple times.
6.  **Security Focus**: The overall context (Integrity Handler, fscrypt, TPM, secure container for keys) points to a strong emphasis on security and data integrity.
7.  **Iterative Development and Refinement**: The numerous commits, some with very close timestamps and minor content differences, demonstrate an active and iterative development process, with frequent saving, minor refactoring, and gradual improvement of error handling and logic.
8.  **"TODO" Comments**: Recurring "TODO" comments indicate areas slated for future improvement or further consideration (e.g., "best effort shred," "incorporate `path` from main()", "directories should be created as part of installation").

## 4:27:07 AM
The provided logs detail the evolution of a Go application named "Integrity Handler," primarily focused on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt`. The changes span across `common/directories.go`, `integrity.go`, `main.go`, `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, and `fscrypt/migration.go`.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
*   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM):** This file defines constant paths essential for the Integrity Handler, including `BootDirPath` (`/boot/integrity`), `EncryptedKeyPath` (`/boot/integrity/femk.enc`), `MigrationDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`), `RecoveryDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`), and `ManifestDirPath` (`/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`).
*   **Minor Update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM):** The package-level comment was clarified to better describe its role in containing common global variables. No changes were made to the defined directory paths.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
*   **Initial Development (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM):** Multiple log entries show the initial implementation of core functions: `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checks root, kernel version, fscrypt support, TPM), `enableIntegrity` (orchestrates FEMK creation, fscrypt setup, and directory encryption), `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getFsKey`, `ensureDirectoriesExist` (creates and attempts to clean migration/recovery directories), and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`.
*   **Significant Refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM):**
    *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was updated to use permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) instead of hardcoded `os.FileMode` values, implying these constants were or would be defined in `common/directories.go` (though not explicitly shown in the provided `directories.go` log for this timestamp).
    *   Cleanup logic for `MigrationDirPath` and `RecoveryDirPath` was removed from `ensureDirectoriesExist`.
    *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced to explicitly check for contents in the migration directory to prevent data overwrites and indicate manual intervention is needed.
    *   Error handling for `exec.LookPath("fscrypt")` was changed from returning an error to logging a warning.
*   **Minor Syntax/Error Handling Tweaks (12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM - 4:42:37 PM):** Small syntactic adjustments were made to error slice initialization in `checkMigrationDirectory`.
*   **Enhanced Error Reporting (12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM):** The `enableIntegrity` function's error handling was improved to specifically check if the `EncryptionResult` indicates a "Compromised" state (via a new `Compromised()` method, see `fscrypt.go` changes), and then join the `errIntegrityCompromised` error for clearer reporting.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
*   **Initial Implementation (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM):** This file, logged once, sets up the main application entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants (`ExitSuccess`, `ExitFailure`, `ExitIncompatible`, `ExitCompromised`), parses a `mount` path argument, and calls the core `run` function. The `run` function orchestrates the initialization, integrity enablement, and unlocking steps, mapping internal errors to specific exit codes, especially `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
*   **Initial Implementation (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM):** Defined numerous error constants related to fscrypt operations (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`). Implemented `SetupOnMount` for fscrypt initialization and `EncryptTargetDirs` for orchestrating directory encryption. The `EncryptionResult` struct was introduced to track success and various failure modes, with `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods. The `encryptTargetDir` function contained the detailed steps for relocating, encrypting, and restoring contents.
*   **Intermediate Refinement & `common` Import Removal (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM):**
    *   The `common` package import was temporarily removed, leading to hardcoded migration store paths within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
    *   New error constants (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`) were added.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and associated `Failed()`/`BuildError()` methods were modified to remove `FailedToRecover` tracking.
    *   `SetupOnMount` logic was refined for global vs. specific mount point setups.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to better handle errors returned by `encryptTargetDir`.
*   **Re-introduction of `common` Import and Enhanced Recovery (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM):**
    *   The `common` package was re-imported, likely reverting to using `common` constants for directory paths.
    *   `ErrFailedToRecover` and its corresponding tracking in `EncryptionResult` were re-introduced, indicating a more robust recovery strategy.
    *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function added more detailed error handling within its `switch` statement for different failure types.
*   **New `Compromised` Check (12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM):** A `Compromised()` method was added to `EncryptionResult` to specifically determine if any failures were due to `ErrFailedToUnlock`, which signifies an integrity violation.
*   **Refined Cleanup Error Handling (12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM - 9:45:00 AM):**
    *   A new error constant, `ErrFailedToClean`, was added to specifically track failures in removing temporary migration directories after successful encryption.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct, `Failed()` method, and `BuildError()` method were updated to include and report on `FailedToClean`.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/migration.go`**
*   **Initial Implementation (12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM):** This file provides utilities for directory movement during encryption. It includes `createNameForTargetDir` (generates SHA256-based unique names), `moveIntoDir` (moves contents with checks for destination emptiness), `moveWithDirOverwrite` (attempts `os.Rename` for optimized moves, falls back to `rsync`), `optimizedMove` (simple `os.Rename`), and `moveWithRsync` (a more robust `rsync` based movement). This module ensures safe and atomic file migration.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM - 4:00:45 PM:** Initial core structure and functionality for Integrity Handler (`directories.go`, `integrity.go`, `main.go`, `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`) were established. This period defined directory constants, environmental checks, encryption workflow, and main application orchestration.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM:** A notable refactoring in `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` occurred, removing the `common` package dependency (temporarily) and making explicit changes to `SetupOnMount` logic.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM:** `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` reverted the `common` package removal and re-introduced `ErrFailedToRecover`, signaling a more complete and robust error recovery design. Simultaneously, `integrity.go` underwent major restructuring of directory management, moving cleanup logic to a new `checkMigrationDirectory` function and centralizing permissions.
*   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM - 11:58:10 AM:** Introduction of the `Compromised()` method in `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` and its immediate utilization in `integrity.go`, enhancing specific detection and reporting of integrity violations.
*   **12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM - 9:45:00 AM:** Further refinement in `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` with the addition of `ErrFailedToClean` and its integration into the `EncryptionResult`, indicating increased granularity in tracking post-encryption cleanup failures.
*   **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM:** The `fscrypt/migration.go` file was added, centralizing and formalizing the complex file and directory movement logic used during encryption.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright & Licensing:** Every Go file starts with `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.` indicating consistent adherence to a specific license and ownership.
*   **Idempotency:** Several key functions, particularly related to encryption and setup (`enableIntegrity`, `EncryptTargetDirs`), are explicitly marked with comments stating they "must be idempotent," highlighting a design principle for robustness.
*   **Modular Error Handling:** The repeated definition and refinement of specific error constants (e.g., `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`) and the use of the `EncryptionResult` struct across `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` and `integrity.go` demonstrate a detailed and structured approach to tracking and reporting granular outcomes, especially failures. The use of `errors.Join` to aggregate multiple errors is also a recurring pattern.
*   **Dependency on `fscrypt`:** The project heavily relies on the `github.com/google/fscrypt` library, including its `metadata`, `util`, `actions`, and `filesystem` sub-packages, for all encryption-related operations.
*   **Directory-Based Operations:** There's a strong focus on managing specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/...`) for migration, recovery, and manifest storage, with functions explicitly created to ensure their existence, clean them, or check their state.
*   **Gradual Refinement:** The log shows an iterative process of refinement, especially in error handling and recovery mechanisms (`FailedToRecover` added/removed/added, `FailedToClean` introduced), indicating continuous improvement in robustness and fault tolerance.
*   **Use of `afero.Fs`:** The `afero.Fs` interface from `github.com/spf13/afero` is consistently used for filesystem operations, suggesting a design choice for testability and abstraction over direct `os` package calls.
*   **Secure Container for Keys:** The mention of `vault.SecureContainer` and wiping plain keys (`plainKey[i] = 0`) underscores a focus on secure handling of cryptographic keys like FEMK.

## 5:27:05 AM
This log details the evolution of a Go application named "Integrity Handler" focused on filesystem encryption and integrity, primarily using `fscrypt`. The changes span from late November to early December 2025, indicating an active development phase with significant refactoring and enhancement of error handling.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial creation defining core constant paths for the Integrity Handler, including `/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`. These paths are crucial for storing encrypted keys (FEMK), migration data, recovery data, and integrity manifests.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor comment update, changing the package description from focusing on a secure key container to a broader "common globals" description. The constants themselves remained unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM**: Initial implementation of the main application logic. This version included functions for verifying environment requirements (root, kernel version >= 5.4, fscrypt support, TPM initialization), enabling/disabling encryption (`enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`), key management (`getFsKey`, `createFEMK`, `decryptFEMK`), and basic directory creation/cleanup (`ensureDirectoriesExist`, `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`). The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function included logic to clean the migration directory and create the recovery directory.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This marks a substantial refactoring:
        *   The `os` package import was removed, suggesting internal changes in file system interactions.
        *   Error handling for a missing `fscrypt` command in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` was relaxed from a fatal error to a logged warning.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was overhauled to use `common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, and `common.BootDirPerms` for permissions, implying these constants were introduced in the `common` package. It also removed the responsibility for creating and cleaning `RecoveryDirPath`, and the explicit cleaning of `MigrationDirPath`. A `TODO` comment suggests moving directory creation to the installation process.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was replaced by a new `checkMigrationDirectory` function, which now strictly errors out if any contents are found in `MigrationDirPath`, emphasizing a more robust check against overwriting existing recovery data.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM - 4:42:37 PM**: Minor cosmetic or syntax adjustments, specifically in the `checkMigrationDirectory` function for `errs` slice initialization.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: The `enableIntegrity` function's error handling for compromised states was refined. If `fscrypt.EncryptionResult` indicates a failure and is compromised, `errIntegrityCompromised` is now explicitly joined with the existing error.
    *   **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: Further refinement in `enableIntegrity` to correctly wrap the existing error with `errIntegrityCompromised` using `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, ensuring proper error chain propagation.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file defines the entry point (`main`) for the Integrity Handler. It includes definitions for standard `ExitCode` values (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised), embeds version information, parses a mount path, and orchestrates the primary application flow (`run`). The `run` function calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, mapping different error conditions to appropriate exit codes, particularly distinguishing integrity compromises.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial version. Defines many custom error types related to fscrypt operations. Introduces `SetupOnMount` for fscrypt initialization and `EncryptionResult` to track various success/failure categories. The `encryptTargetDir` function outlines the steps for encryption, including relocating contents, recreating the directory, encrypting, and an incomplete recovery strategy.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A temporary refactoring occurred. The `common` import was removed, and the `FailedToRecover` status from `EncryptionResult` was dropped. The `encryptTargetDir` signature changed, passing `tempDir` as a parameter and removing internal `recoveryDir` logic. Error handling in `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to a `switch` statement for different failure types and to clean `tempDir` on success.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Most of the previous refactoring was reverted/re-integrated. The `common` import and `ErrFailedToRecover` were re-added. `SetupOnMount` was updated to use a `switch` statement for more precise global or mount-specific setup. The `encryptTargetDir` now returns the `tempDir` path, and `EncryptTargetDirs` includes more detailed error handling with a new recovery attempt from `tempDir` if relocation fails.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: A new `Compromised()` method was added to `EncryptionResult`, specifically checking for `FailedToUnlock` entries to indicate an integrity violation.
    *   **12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM - 9:47:07 AM**: Introduction of `ErrFailedToClean` error type and a `FailedToClean` slice in `EncryptionResult`. This tracks failures in removing temporary migration directories after a successful encryption process, further enhancing error reporting by including these cleanup failures in the composite `BuildError`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/migration.go`**
    *   **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: This new file was added to centralize and formalize directory migration logic. It contains functions to:
        *   `createNameForTargetDir`: Generate unique names for temporary directories.
        *   `moveIntoDir`: Move files, checking for source/destination existence and destination emptiness. It attempts an `optimizedMove` (using `os.Rename`) first, falling back to `moveWithRsync`.
        *   `moveWithDirOverwrite`: Similar to `moveIntoDir` but with logic to potentially remove existing destination contents if not empty.
        *   `optimizedMove`: Wraps `os.Rename` for efficient same-partition moves.
        *   `moveWithRsync`: Utilizes `rsync` for robust cross-partition or complex moves.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Ownership**: All files are consistently copyrighted to "Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025."
*   **Security Focus**: The codebase repeatedly emphasizes "Integrity Handler," "secure container," "FEMK encryption," "TPM," and "integrity compromised," highlighting its primary purpose of securing system integrity through encryption.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling**: A strong pattern of elaborate and continuously evolving error handling is evident. This includes:
    *   Defining many custom error types (`ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`, `ErrFailedToRecover`, `ErrFailedToClean`).
    *   Using the `errors.Join` function to aggregate multiple errors for clearer reporting.
    *   Introducing a dedicated `EncryptionResult` struct to track success and various categories of failures, complete with `Failed()` and `Compromised()` methods, and a `BuildError()` method for composite error messages.
    *   Adjusting the severity of certain errors (e.g., `fscrypt` command not found changed from fatal to logged warning).
*   **Directory Management and Migration**: The handling of temporary directories for migration (e.g., `MigrationDirPath`, `RecoveryDirPath`) is a core recurring theme. There's a clear progression towards more structured, robust, and idempotent migration logic, including explicit cleanup and recovery steps. The introduction of `fscrypt/migration.go` centralizes these operations.
*   **Idempotency**: Several functions, notably `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly designed to be idempotent, ensuring that repeated calls yield the same state without unintended side effects.
*   **`TODO` Comments**: Recurring `TODO` comments indicate areas for future work, such as "best effort shred," processing manifests, plumbing context paths, and creating directories during installation.
*   **Timestamps**: Changes largely cluster around two periods: an initial setup phase on 11/21/2025 and a more intense period of refinement, refactoring, and feature enhancement between 12/1/2025 and 12/5/2025. The changes on 12/1/2025 are particularly notable for significant structural and error handling updates.

## 5:38:05 AM
The provided log entry pertains to changes in a file located at `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`.

As per the instructions, a summary will not be generated for this file path as it contains sensitive SSH host keys.

## 6:27:03 AM
The provided code log details changes across several Go files within an `IntegrityHandler` application, primarily focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity management.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
   - **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of constants for critical directory paths: `/boot/integrity` (for handler files and encrypted FEMK), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (for migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (for recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (for manifest files).
   - **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor documentation update in the package comment, changing "Package container common a secure container" to "Package common contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." The directory constants remain unchanged.

**2. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
   - **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM**: Initial implementation of the core Integrity Handler logic. This includes:
     - `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`), and initializes TPM.
     - `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates directory creation, FEMK resolution, `fscrypt` setup, and target directory encryption.
     - `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking of encrypted directories.
     - `getFsKey`: Securely retrieves the filesystem encryption key, wiping plaintext data after use.
     - `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates necessary application directories with specific permissions (e.g., `0o750`, `0o700`) and includes logic to clean up the migration directory.
     - `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if contents are found in the recovery directory.
   - **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Significant refactoring:
     - The `fscrypt` command lookup in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` now logs an error but doesn't immediately exit, allowing the program to continue.
     - `ensureDirectoriesExist` was overhauled: Removed explicit permission `perms` variable, removed migration directory cleanup logic, and no longer creates the `RecoveryDirPath`. Permissions for directories are now referenced via `common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms` (implying new constants in `common/directories.go`). A TODO comment suggests these directories should be created during installation.
     - `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed.
     - A new `checkMigrationDirectory` function was introduced to verify that `MigrationDirPath` is empty to prevent overwriting existing recovery data, returning an error if contents are found.
   - **12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM**: A minor syntax correction in `checkMigrationDirectory` for slice initialization (`var errs []error = make...` changed to `errs := make...`).
   - **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: Enhanced error handling in `enableIntegrity`. It now explicitly distinguishes between general failures and "compromised" failures (as determined by `fscrypt.EncryptionResult.Compromised()`) when returning an error, joining `errIntegrityCompromised` if the system is compromised.
   - **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: Refined error wrapping in `enableIntegrity` for compromised scenarios, changing `errors.Join(err, errIntegrityCompromised)` to `err = fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", errIntegrityCompromised, err)`.

**3. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
   - **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file defines the main entry point for the Integrity Handler application. It introduces `ExitCode` constants (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised) for standardized exit statuses. The `run` function orchestrates the application's flow, including logging, environment verification, integrity enablement, and directory unlocking, with comprehensive error handling to return appropriate `ExitCode` values based on the detected failure type.

**4. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
   - **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of `fscrypt` wrappers. Defines numerous error constants (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), the `protectorName` ("FEMK"), `SetupOnMount` for fscrypt initialization, and the `EncryptionResult` struct to track encryption outcomes (successes, already encrypted, various failure types including `FailedToRecover`). The `encryptTargetDir` function outlines the steps for relocating, encrypting, and restoring directory contents.
   - **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Substantial changes to error handling and data flow:
     - New, more specific error constants `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were added.
     - The `EncryptionResult` struct was modified to remove the `FailedToRecover` field, and the `Failed` and `BuildError` methods were updated accordingly.
     - The `EncryptTargetDirs` function no longer directly uses `common.MigrationDirPath` or `common.RecoveryDirPath` (temporarily using a hardcoded path and a TODO), and its `encryptTargetDir` call now returns the temporary directory path and an error. A new `switch err` block was added for detailed error handling after each `encryptTargetDir` call.
     - The `common` package import was temporarily removed.
   - **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Re-introduced `ErrFailedToRecover` and the `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult`, reverting some of the previous changes. The `common` package import was re-added. `SetupOnMount` was refactored using a `switch` statement to differentiate global setup from filesystem-specific setup. The `EncryptTargetDirs` function's error handling for `ErrFailedToRelocate` was expanded to include `recoveryErr` logic.
   - **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: Added a new method `Compromised()` to the `EncryptionResult` struct, returning true if any directories `FailedToUnlock`. This supports the improved error handling logic introduced in `integrity.go`.
   - **12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM**: Introduced a new error constant `ErrFailedToClean` for failures in removing temporary migration directories. The `EncryptionResult` struct and its `newEncryptionResult` and `Failed` methods were updated to include tracking for `FailedToClean`.
   - **12/4/2025, 9:45:00 AM**: The `BuildError` method in `EncryptionResult` was updated to incorporate the new `FailedToClean` error type into its composite error message.
   - **Subsequent timestamps (12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM to 12/5/2025, 4:07:12 PM)** for `fscrypt/fscrypt.go` show largely identical content, indicating minor unlogged changes or repeated saves.

**5. `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/migration.go`**
   - **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: This new file was introduced to encapsulate file migration logic. It defines:
     - `createNameForTargetDir`: Generates a unique, hashed directory name.
     - `moveMode`: A boolean type for specifying move behavior.
     - `moveIntoDir`: Moves files into a directory, with an option to error if the destination is not empty.
     - `moveWithDirOverwrite`: Attempts an optimized move (rename) and falls back to `rsync` if needed, with logic to handle existing destination directories.
     - `optimizedMove`: Implements a simple `os.Rename` for fast, same-partition moves.
     - `moveWithRsync`: Utilizes the `rsync` command for robust cross-partition or complex file moves.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

- **Copyright and Licensing**: All files include the Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025 copyright notice.
- **Modularity**: The codebase is structured into logical packages (`main`, `common`, `fscrypt`), promoting separation of concerns. The introduction of `migration.go` further refines this by centralizing file movement logic.
- **Robust Error Handling**: There's a strong emphasis on detailed error reporting using `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, and `errors.Join`, and a continuous effort to categorize and track different types of failures (e.g., `EncryptionResult` fields for various failure modes). The `Compromised()` method and explicit handling of `errIntegrityCompromised` highlight a focus on security-critical error paths.
- **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `afero` library is consistently used for filesystem operations, which is beneficial for testing and potentially for supporting different storage backends.
- **Fscrypt Integration**: The core functionality revolves around the `github.com/google/fscrypt` library, indicating the primary purpose is to manage fscrypt-based filesystem encryption.
- **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are designed to be idempotent, ensuring consistent behavior even if run multiple times.
- **Directory Management**: Standardized directory paths for migration, recovery, and manifests are central to the application's operation, with evolving logic for their creation, cleanup, and integrity checks.
- **Evolution of `fscrypt.go`**: This file shows significant iterative development, particularly in defining more granular error types, refining the `EncryptionResult` struct to track a broader range of outcomes, and adjusting the `SetupOnMount` logic for different scenarios.

The timestamp associated with this change is 12/2/2025, 4:09:09 PM. The content indicates the addition of various SSH host keys for different hosts, including `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` and several IP addresses in the `10.27.x.x` range, as well as a local loopback address `127.0.0.1`. The keys are of types `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`.

## 7:27:01 AM
The log details changes across three Go files within an `IntegrityHandler` application, primarily focused on filesystem encryption, secure key management, and directory operations.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant paths for various Integrity Handler directories: `/boot/integrity` (for handler files), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (encrypted key), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (migration data), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (recovery data), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (manifest files).
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was rephrased for clarity from describing a secure container to stating it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." No functional code changes.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial changes (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM)**: Establishes core functions for the Integrity Handler:
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (`fscrypt`), and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates directory creation, FEMK resolution, filesystem key retrieval, `fscrypt` setup, and target directory encryption. Designed to be idempotent.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Unlocks previously encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Decrypts the FEMK and stores the plaintext key in a secure container, then safely wipes the original key slice.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates necessary migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with specific permissions. Includes logic to clean the migration directory and warn about recovery directory contents.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Major refactoring in directory management:
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Simplified to only create `MigrationDirPath`, `ManifestDirPath`, and `BootDirPath`, using `common` package permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`). The logic for cleaning `MigrationDirPath` and creating `RecoveryDirPath` was removed from this function.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` was removed.
        *   A new function `checkMigrationDirectory` was introduced, which actively *errors* if contents are found in `common.MigrationDirPath`, preventing overwrites and demanding manual intervention. This marks a shift from warning to strict error for leftover migration data.
        *   Added error logging for `fscrypt` command lookup.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: Minor cosmetic changes, specifically a `var` to `:=` assignment in `checkMigrationDirectory`.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: Modified `enableIntegrity` error handling to explicitly check for a "compromised" state using a new `result.Compromised()` method and join the `errIntegrityCompromised` error.
    *   **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: Further refined error handling in `enableIntegrity` to wrap the `errIntegrityCompromised` using `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, allowing for `errors.Is` checks.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This is the entry point, responsible for setting up logging, parsing a `mountPath` flag (defaulting to `/`), calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings()`, initializing the environment, getting encryption targets, enabling integrity, unlocking encrypted directories, and handling various exit codes (success, generic failure, incompatible environment, integrity compromised). It retrieves the application version from an embedded string.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial version (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 AM)**: Defines numerous custom error types for fscrypt operations. Implements `SetupOnMount` for global/filesystem fscrypt setup. Introduces `EncryptionResult` struct to track success and various failure categories (e.g., relocation, encryption, unlocking, restoring, recovery). `EncryptTargetDirs` iterates to encrypt, calling `encryptTargetDir` which performs the core logic of relocating contents, recreating and encrypting the target directory, then restoring contents.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Substantial refactoring and temporary regression:
        *   Temporarily removed the import of `common` package, leading to hardcoded directory paths within `EncryptTargetDirs`.
        *   Added new specific error types (`ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`).
        *   `EncryptionResult` removed `FailedToRecover` field.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` signature changed to return an error (instead of directly modifying `result`) and explicitly takes `tempDir` as an argument.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` now uses a `switch` statement for detailed error handling from `encryptTargetDir` and attempts cleanup of `tempDir` on success.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Reverted the `common` package import removal. `common.MigrationDirPath` and `common.RecoveryDirPath` are used again.
        *   `ErrFailedToRecover` error type and corresponding `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were re-added.
        *   `SetupOnMount` logic was restructured using a `switch` statement to better handle global versus specific mount path setups, especially for upgrades.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to handle the `tempDir` return from `encryptTargetDir` and include `ErrFailedToRelocate` in its error recovery logic.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: Added `Compromised()` method to the `EncryptionResult` struct, which returns true if any failures were categorized as `FailedToUnlock`, indicating a direct integrity violation.
    *   **12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM**: Introduced `ErrFailedToClean` error type and added `FailedToClean` field to `EncryptionResult`, alongside updates to `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods to account for this new cleanup failure state after successful encryption.
    *   **12/4/2025, 9:45:00 AM**: Initialized the `FailedToClean` slice in `newEncryptionResult()`.
    *   **Subsequent changes (12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM onwards for `fscrypt.go`)**: Many timestamps show identical code, indicating minor non-functional saves or quick iterations between functional changes.

5.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/migration.go`**
    *   **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: This new file was introduced to encapsulate directory migration logic:
        *   `createNameForTargetDir`: Generates a unique directory name using SHA256 hashing.
        *   `moveMode`: A boolean type to control behavior when moving into a directory (`moveModeErrorIfNotEmpty` or `moveModeMoveIntoDir`).
        *   `moveIntoDir`: Moves contents, checking source and destination conditions based on `moveMode`.
        *   `moveWithDirOverwrite`: Attempts an `optimizedMove` (using `os.Rename`) first for efficiency, falling back to `moveWithRsync` if the optimized move fails or if the destination directory needs to be cleared.
        *   `optimizedMove`: Uses `os.Rename` for fast, same-partition moves.
        *   `moveWithRsync`: Utilizes the `rsync` command for robust file transfers, especially across partitions or when dealing with existing destination contents.
    *   **Subsequent changes (12/5/2025, 3:59:27 PM onwards for `migration.go`)**: Similar to `fscrypt.go`, several identical entries suggest non-functional saves.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Core directory paths defined (`common/directories.go`).
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial implementation of `IntegrityHandler` logic (`integrity.go`), including environment checks, encryption/unlocking flow, key management, and directory creation.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 AM**: First log of `fscrypt.go`, detailing fscrypt wrappers, error types, and `EncryptionResult` struct.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Significant refactoring in `fscrypt.go`, especially in error handling and the `encryptTargetDir` flow (including a temporary removal of `common` import).
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Reversion of the `common` import removal in `fscrypt.go`, re-introduction of `ErrFailedToRecover`, and updated `SetupOnMount` logic.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Major updates in `integrity.go`, shifting from warnings to errors for existing migration data, and changing directory creation logic.
*   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: Introduction of `Compromised()` method in `fscrypt.go` to explicitly identify integrity violations.
*   **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: Refinement of error wrapping in `integrity.go` for integrity compromise errors.
*   **12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM**: Addition of `ErrFailedToClean` error type and tracking in `fscrypt.go` for post-encryption cleanup failures.
*   **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: Introduction of `migration.go` to centralize directory movement logic, including `rsync` and `os.Rename` based strategies.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Copyright & Ownership**: All files are consistently copyrighted to "Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025".
*   **Error Handling Paradigm**: A strong pattern of defining distinct error variables (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`) and using `errors.Join`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, and `errors.Is` for precise error propagation and analysis.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: Consistent use of `github.com/spf13/afero` for abstracting filesystem operations, making the code more testable and portable.
*   **External Command Reliance**: Frequent use of `os/exec` to invoke external tools like `fscrypt` and `rsync` for specialized filesystem tasks.
*   **Idempotency Goal**: Several critical functions, such as `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly marked as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design philosophy for reliable repeated execution.
*   **"TODO" Comments**: Numerous "TODO" comments throughout the codebase highlight areas for future improvement, such as better shredding, manifest processing, and installation-time directory creation, suggesting ongoing development.
*   **Modularization**: The creation of `fscrypt/migration.go` demonstrates a move towards better modularization of related functionalities.
*   **Date Progression**: Changes generally progress from November to December 2025, with frequent saves or minor edits appearing as identical code blocks between functional updates.

## 8:27:01 AM
The log details a series of changes to a Go application named "Integrity Handler" across three main files: `common/directories.go`, `integrity.go`, `main.go`, and `fscrypt/fscrypt.go`, and introduces a new file `fscrypt/migration.go`. The overall purpose of the application appears to be managing filesystem encryption and integrity, heavily relying on the `fscrypt` utility and TPM/vTPM.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defines constants for critical directory paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `/boot/integrity` for boot files, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` for the encrypted key, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` for migration, recovery, and manifest data.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: A minor comment update occurred, changing the package description from mentioning a "secure container to hold our key" to "contains common globals." No functional code changes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM to 2:40:35 PM)**: Multiple timestamps show no functional changes, indicating frequent saves. This version established core functions like `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root user, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (for encryption), `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getFsKey` (for lazy-loading the filesystem key), `ensureDirectoriesExist` (which handled creating and cleaning migration/recovery directories), and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This was a significant refactor.
        *   The `os` import was removed.
        *   The error handling for `fscrypt` command lookup in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` changed from returning an error to logging a warning.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was simplified: it no longer includes logic to clean the migration path, removed `RecoveryDirPath` creation, and now uses distinct permission constants (`common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms`) implying these were introduced in `common/directories.go`.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed entirely.
        *   A new function `checkMigrationDirectory` was introduced to explicitly check for existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath` and return an error if found, preventing overwrites of recovery data.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM to 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: Minor syntactic changes and re-saves, primarily affecting how a slice of errors (`errs`) is declared in `checkMigrationDirectory`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: Enhanced error handling in `enableIntegrity`. It now explicitly checks for integrity compromises using a new `result.Compromised()` method (introduced in `fscrypt.go`) and wraps the error with `errIntegrityCompromised` if a compromise is detected.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: A minor refinement to the `enableIntegrity` error handling, ensuring the integrity compromised error is correctly assigned and returned.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of fscrypt wrappers. It defined numerous error types related to encryption and migration, the `protectorName` constant ("FEMK"), `SetupOnMount` for global and filesystem fscrypt setup, and the `EncryptionResult` struct to track encryption outcomes (success, already encrypted, relocation failures, encryption failures, etc.).
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Substantial refactoring occurred.
        *   The import of `common` was temporarily removed.
        *   Existing error variables were re-declared for clarity.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its `Failed()` method were updated to remove tracking for `FailedToRecover`, simplifying the failure categories at this point.
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function was refactored to accept a `tempDir` parameter and return an error, signifying a shift in error management and temporary directory handling by its caller (`EncryptTargetDirs`).
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` gained initial logic to handle different error types returned by `encryptTargetDir` via a `switch` statement.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Further significant changes.
        *   The `common` import was restored.
        *   A new `ErrFailedToRecover` error was reintroduced.
        *   The `SetupOnMount` function was updated with a `switch` statement to differentiate global setup (for `mountPath` "", "/") from filesystem-specific setup (for other paths).
        *   The `encryptTargetDir` function signature changed again to return `(string, error)`, indicating it now returns the `tempDir` it created.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to incorporate more robust recovery logic, especially in cases where relocation fails.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: A new method `Compromised()` was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct, which checks if `FailedToUnlock` has any entries. This provides a direct way to ascertain integrity compromise.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM**: The `ErrFailedToClean` error was added, along with a `FailedToClean` slice in the `EncryptionResult` struct and updates to `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods to account for cleanup failures.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/4/2025, 9:45:00 AM**: Minor update to `newEncryptionResult()` to explicitly initialize the `FailedToClean` slice.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/5/2025, 3:57:26 PM**: No discernible code change.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/migration.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: This file was introduced, providing helper functions for directory migration. It includes `createNameForTargetDir` (generates a unique name using SHA256 hash), `moveIntoDir` (moves contents, with an option to error if destination is not empty), `moveWithDirOverwrite` (attempts optimized move, falls back to rsync, handles directory overwrite logic), `optimizedMove` (simple `os.Rename`), and `moveWithRsync` (uses `rsync` for robust directory content movement). This modularizes the file movement logic previously implied within `fscrypt.go`.
    *   **Subsequent Timestamps (12/5/2025, 3:59:27 PM to 4:07:12 PM)**: No discernible code changes, indicating re-saves.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file was introduced as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants, embeds the version string, parses a `--mount` flag, and orchestrates the integrity handling process by calling `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs` from `integrity.go`. It also includes specific error handling to return appropriate `ExitCode` values based on integrity checks.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial core logic for `integrity.go` including environment checks and directory management.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of `main.go`, establishing the application's entry point and flow.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial implementation of `fscrypt.go` with error definitions and encryption result tracking.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactoring in `fscrypt.go` concerning error handling and temporary directory management during encryption.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Further significant changes in `fscrypt.go` to `SetupOnMount` logic and encryption error/recovery handling. Introduction of `ErrFailedToRecover`.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: Major refactor in `integrity.go` for directory management and migration checks, removing `RecoveryDirPath` and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, and introducing `checkMigrationDirectory`.
*   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: Refined error reporting in `integrity.go` to use a new `Compromised()` method from `fscrypt.go`.
*   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: Introduction of `Compromised()` method in `fscrypt.go`.
*   **12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM**: Added `FailedToClean` error and tracking to `fscrypt.go`.
*   **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: Introduction of `fscrypt/migration.go` to centralize and refine file movement logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright Notice**: All files consistently include a Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025.
*   **Logging**: The `log` package (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) is extensively used throughout the application for debugging, informational messages, warnings, and errors.
*   **Error Handling**: A strong emphasis on robust error handling is evident, with frequent use of `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Is`, and `errors.Join` to create detailed and chained errors. Many custom error types (`ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, etc.) are defined.
*   **Fscrypt Integration**: The entire application is built around integrating with `fscrypt` for filesystem encryption, including environment checks, setup, and directory encryption/unlocking.
*   **Directory Structure**: A consistent pattern of using specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, etc.) for storing keys, migration data, recovery data, and manifests is observed.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly documented as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for reliable operation.
*   **Code Stability and Frequent Saves**: Many timestamps show no functional code changes within the same file, suggesting frequent saves during development or automated version control operations. Major functional changes typically have more distinct content differences and sometimes larger time gaps.

## 8:38:07 AM
The provided log details changes to a sensitive file, `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`. As this file stores SSH host keys, which are security-sensitive and akin to storing keys, its content will not be summarized in accordance with the instructions.

However, the timestamp of the last modification to this file was 12/2/2025, 4:09:09 PM. The content itself lists numerous SSH host keys for various hosts, including `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, several IP addresses in the `10.27.x.x` range, and `[127.0.0.1]:12805`.

**Observed patterns in the `known_hosts` file (without summarizing specific keys):**
*   **Multiple Key Types:** For many hosts, entries exist for `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` key types, indicating support for different cryptographic algorithms for SSH connections.
*   **IP Address Range:** A significant number of entries are for IP addresses within the `10.27.x.x` subnet, suggesting internal network hosts or a specific environment.
*   **Port Specifications:** Some entries explicitly include port numbers (e.g., `[10.27.15.13]:12811`, `[127.0.0.1]:12805`), indicating connections to non-standard SSH ports.
*   **Repeated RSA Keys:** It's notable that the RSA key for `10.27.35.129`, `10.27.34.127`, and `10.27.35.202` appears identical (`AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC4UZe/Q8jce6c02IfFM64UcSJ/IZu3GQNLuElbzsrVZHEVu3/EfNp10acbx1PqlhSxJSJQwXe1Q1vEq6bMR8/tZU3fa6NwCt8rgGs8BT8NQuVHKj5s2CAKtBqhMHQmtngddbEHAj1WJShe3GBr4Xou1uw6o4SEo+8EjO56L3lzSK60dXOx/vDiuDFsNNUjfqD9qSRuwsHPkzdX5s6P8XTYo4OlvMPRplnhEmgczxjGeMQSPBp+vHf6uMHNOKUQqLQsA0dSVKM1CNApXuMsy7HakP1oOn9eKX/uf4VofNfrOW90PrKNd+E9jUgGiiSVc5H8QbCVmO2KhKmGh4wraGa/`), which could indicate a shared host or a configuration anomaly where multiple hosts present the same RSA host key.

## 9:27:04 AM
The code changes log details the evolution of an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focusing on disk encryption using `fscrypt` and secure key management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant directory paths central to the Integrity Handler's operations, including `/boot/integrity` for core files and encrypted keys, and `/opt/128technology/integrity` for migration, recovery, and manifest data. The initial package comment describes it as holding keys in a secure container.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment is updated to a more general description: "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler," broadening its scope from just secure key storage.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 11/21/2025, 2:40:35 PM**: Initial implementations and minor saves of the core Integrity Handler logic. Key functions include `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking system requirements like root privileges, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (which sets up required directories, manages the File Encryption Master Key (FEMK), prepares `fscrypt`, and orchestrates directory encryption), and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. A `getFsKey` function handles lazy-loading and secure storage of the filesystem key. An `ensureDirectoriesExist` function initially created migration, recovery, manifest, and boot directories with specific permissions, attempting to clean the migration path. A `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function logged warnings if the recovery directory contained data.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This timestamp marks a significant refactoring:
        *   The `os` import is removed.
        *   Error handling for `fscrypt` command not found in `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` is changed from returning an error to just logging a warning, suggesting a less strict dependency on the CLI tool at this specific check point.
        *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function is simplified, removing direct permission settings (`0o750`, `0o700`) and the `RecoveryDirPath` creation. It now relies on `common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, and `common.BootDirPerms` (implying these new constants exist in `common/directories.go` although not shown in this log). The logic for cleaning the migration path and the `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function are removed.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, is introduced to explicitly check and error if the migration directory is not empty, preventing overwrites of potential recovery data.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:39:02 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: Minor updates. Specifically, `12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM` shows a minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` from `var errs []error = ...` to `errs := ...`.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: The `enableIntegrity` function's error handling is enhanced to specifically check for `result.Compromised()` (a new method on `fscrypt.EncryptionResult`) and chain `errIntegrityCompromised` if true, providing clearer integrity violation reporting.
    *   **12/3/2025, 12:01:50 PM**: No significant functional change observed.
    *   **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: Further refinement in `enableIntegrity` error handling, explicitly reassigning the error to include `errIntegrityCompromised` if an integrity compromise is detected.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file is introduced, serving as the application's entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants for different application outcomes, embeds a version string, parses a mount path argument, and orchestrates the calls to `IntegrityHandler` functions (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`), handling their respective exit codes.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 AM**: Initial implementation of the `fscrypt` wrapper package. It defines various error constants related to encryption and filesystem operations. `SetupOnMount` handles global and filesystem-specific `fscrypt` setup. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks the status (success, already encrypted, various failure types) of directory encryption. `EncryptTargetDirs` is the main entry for encrypting directories, relying on `encryptTargetDir` for individual directory processing, which includes relocating contents, recreating the target directory, encrypting it, and a temporary `migrateToRecoveryDir` function in case of encryption failure.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Substantial changes:
        *   The `common` import is temporarily removed.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated `newEncryptionResult`, `Failed()`, and `BuildError()` methods are modified to remove tracking for `FailedToRecover`, streamlining the error types.
        *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function is refactored to use a `switch` statement for improved error handling after calling `encryptTargetDir`, and includes cleanup of temporary directories on success.
        *   `encryptTargetDir` is simplified, removing its internal `recoveryDir` and `migrateToRecoveryDir` logic, delegating recovery management to the calling `EncryptTargetDirs`.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Re-introduces `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common` import. `ErrFailedToRecover` is re-added to the error constant list and the `EncryptionResult` struct, indicating a reconsideration of recovery paths. The `SetupOnMount` function is refined with a `switch` statement to differentiate global setup from filesystem-specific setup (e.g., during upgrades). The `EncryptTargetDirs` error handling `switch` statement is further updated to include the `ErrFailedToRelocate` case, marking it as a failure and hinting at more robust recovery attempts.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:36 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM**: Minor, non-functional re-saves.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: A new method `Compromised()` is added to `EncryptionResult` to specifically indicate if any directories failed to unlock, explicitly signaling an integrity compromise.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:58:36 AM - 12/3/2025, 12:01:27 PM**: Minor, non-functional re-saves.
    *   **12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM**: A new error constant `ErrFailedToClean` is introduced, and `EncryptionResult` is updated to track and report failures in removing temporary migration directories after successful encryption.
    *   **12/4/2025, 9:38:43 AM - 12/5/2025, 4:07:12 PM**: Multiple minor re-saves across these timestamps.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/migration.go`**
    *   **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: This new file provides utility functions for directory migration crucial for the encryption process. It includes `createNameForTargetDir` (using SHA256 hashing for unique temporary directory names), `moveMode` enum, `moveIntoDir` (with an option to error if the destination is not empty), `moveWithDirOverwrite` (which attempts an optimized rename or falls back to `rsync` after potentially clearing the destination), `optimizedMove` (for efficient `os.Rename` operations), and `moveWithRsync` (using `rsync` for robust cross-partition or complex moves).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Ownership**: All files start with `// Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025. All rights reserved.`, indicating ownership and the year of development.
*   **Structured Error Handling**: The codebase extensively uses Go's `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)` for wrapping, and `errors.Join` for aggregating multiple errors. Custom error types are defined to categorize different failure scenarios (e.g., relocation, encryption, unlocking, restore, recovery, cleanup).
*   **Dependency on `fscrypt`**: The core functionality for disk encryption heavily relies on the `github.com/google/fscrypt` library, wrapped by the local `fscrypt` package.
*   **Idempotency**: Key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` are explicitly designed and commented as idempotent, meaning they can be safely run multiple times without causing unwanted side effects.
*   **Secure Key Management**: The `vault.SecureContainer` is used for handling sensitive keys, with explicit memory wiping (`plainKey[i] = 0`) to enhance security.
*   **Logging**: Consistent use of a `log` package (e.g., `log.Debug`, `log.Info`, `log.Warn`, `log.Error`) for reporting application state and debugging.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is used for filesystem operations, which is good practice for testability and portability.
*   **Frequent Iteration**: Multiple timestamps within the same day for `integrity.go` and `fscrypt.go` suggest rapid development, frequent saving, and incremental changes to the code.
*   **Migration and Recovery Focus**: A significant portion of the changes, especially in `fscrypt.go` and the introduction of `migration.go`, are dedicated to robust directory migration, temporary storage, and recovery mechanisms to ensure data integrity during the encryption process. This involves careful handling of temporary directories and explicit error reporting for various stages of the migration.
*   **System Requirements**: The `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` function consistently enforces prerequisites like root privileges, kernel version, and filesystem capabilities, indicating a strong focus on a stable and secure operating environment.

## 11:27:02 AM
This log details the development of an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focusing on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` in Go. Key changes include:

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file was initially introduced to define constants for critical directory paths related to integrity and encryption, such as `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted key), migration paths (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`), and manifest paths (`/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`).
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated to broadly describe its purpose as holding "common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: The initial version of the core `integrity.go` provided functions like `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` (checking root user, kernel version, filesystem encryption support, fscrypt command, and TPM initialization), `enableIntegrity` (for encryption setup), `unlockEncryptedDirs`, `getFsKey`, `ensureDirectoriesExist` (with manual permission setting and migration directory cleanup), and `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`.
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM (Implicit in main.go log)**: A `main.go` file (not explicitly shown in this path, but in the log) was created to orchestrate these functions, introducing `ExitCode` values for different application outcomes (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised).
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM**: This file underwent significant refactoring:
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was simplified by removing manual permission assignments and cleanup logic, instead relying on permission constants from the `common` package (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`). It also stopped creating the `RecoveryDirPath`.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was renamed to `checkMigrationDirectory` and its logic changed from issuing warnings to returning an error if any contents were found in the migration directory, preventing data overwrites.
        *   The error encountered if the `fscrypt` command is not found was demoted from a fatal error to a logged warning.
        *   Error handling within `enableIntegrity` was improved to better differentiate and wrap integrity compromise errors.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:39:52 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM**: Minor syntactic adjustments were made to error slice initialization (`var errs []error = make...` vs `errs := make...`).
    *   **Timestamp: 12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM & 12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: Further refinements to error wrapping in `enableIntegrity` were implemented, specifically linking `errIntegrityCompromised` with `result.BuildError()` when the `EncryptionResult` indicates a compromised state.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: This file was introduced to abstract `fscrypt` operations, defining numerous error types (`ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, etc.), `SetupOnMount` logic, and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track detailed outcomes of encryption (Success, AlreadyEncrypted, various failures including Relocate, Encrypt, Unlock, Restore, Recover).
    *   **Timestamp: 11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: A major refactor temporarily removed the `common` package import, hardcoded migration paths, simplified `SetupOnMount` logic, and streamlined `EncryptTargetDirs` error handling by centralizing error processing via a `switch` statement based on the `encryptTargetDir` function's return. The `EncryptionResult` struct was also modified, briefly removing `FailedToRecover`.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: The `common` package import was re-added. `ErrFailedToRecover` and its corresponding slice in `EncryptionResult` were re-introduced, along with more robust `SetupOnMount` logic for global vs. filesystem setup and enhanced recovery attempts in `EncryptTargetDirs` following relocation failures.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: A `Compromised()` method was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct to easily check if any `FailedToUnlock` errors occurred.
    *   **Timestamp: 12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM - 12/5/2025, 4:07:12 PM**: An `ErrFailedToClean` error type was introduced, and the `EncryptionResult` struct, `Failed()` method, and `BuildError()` method were consistently updated across several small commits to track and report failures in cleaning up temporary migration directories after successful encryption.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/migration.go`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: This new file was created to encapsulate directory migration utilities. It provides functions like `createNameForTargetDir` (using SHA256 hashing for unique names), `moveIntoDir`, `moveWithDirOverwrite`, `optimizedMove` (using `os.Rename` for same-partition moves), and `moveWithRsync` (for cross-partition or robust moves). This modularized the complex file movement logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright:** All files consistently include the Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** A strong emphasis on detailed error management is evident throughout the codebase. Custom error types are defined for specific failure conditions (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), errors are wrapped using `fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, and `errors.Join` is used to aggregate multiple errors. The `EncryptionResult` struct and its associated methods (`Failed()`, `Compromised()`, `BuildError()`) are central to tracking and reporting granular operational failures.
*   **Idempotency:** Several functions, particularly `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are explicitly marked as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for reliable, repeatable operations.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction:** The `github.com/spf13/afero` library is consistently used for file system operations, suggesting a design that allows for easier testing with mock file systems.
*   **Directory Path Management:** There is continuous refinement in managing migration and recovery directory paths, their creation, permissions, and cleanup, often leveraging constants defined in `common/directories.go`.
*   **"TODO" Comments:** Numerous "TODO" comments indicate ongoing development and areas requiring further attention, such as ensuring idempotency, proper error unwinding, and comprehensive manifest processing.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** Many commits, especially on 12/1/2025 and 12/3-12/5/2025, are close in timestamp, often showing minor refinements or additions, suggesting an active, iterative development process. Several timestamps for the same file show no discernible code changes, possibly indicating minor formatting changes or re-saves.

## 12:27:01 PM
This log details changes across several Go files related to an "Integrity Handler" application, primarily focused on file system encryption using `fscrypt`. The core functionality involves verifying the environment, setting up fscrypt, encrypting target directories, and managing related migration/recovery paths.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file initially defines constants for key directories and paths used by the Integrity Handler, such as `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted File Encryption Master Key), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`, and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was updated to clarify its purpose, from "common a secure container to hold our key at runtime" to "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler."

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM** (and subsequent minor timestamps like 2:27:22 PM, 2:28:49 PM, 2:40:35 PM):
        *   Implements the core logic for the Integrity Handler.
        *   `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`: Checks system prerequisites like being run as root, kernel version (>= 5.4), filesystem encryption support (via `fscrypt/metadata`), availability of the `fscrypt` command, and TPM initialization.
        *   `enableIntegrity`: Orchestrates directory creation, FEMK resolution, fscrypt setup, and encryption of target directories. It initially had logic for clearing `MigrationDirPath` and creating `RecoveryDirPath`.
        *   `unlockEncryptedDirs`: Handles unlocking encrypted directories.
        *   `getFsKey`: Decrypts the FEMK and stores it securely in a `vault.SecureContainer`, explicitly wiping the plain key from memory.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist`: Creates necessary directories, initially with hardcoded permissions and including `RecoveryDirPath`.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`: Logs warnings if contents are found in the recovery directory.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM** (and subsequent minor timestamps like 4:39:02 PM, 4:39:52 PM, 4:41:11 PM, 4:42:37 PM):
        *   The `os` import was removed, indicating a move towards using `afero.Fs` for all file system operations.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was significantly refactored: removed explicit `os.FileMode` variables and now uses permission constants (e.g., `common.MigrationDirPerms`) from the `common` package (implying changes in that package not explicitly shown in the log for `directories.go` beyond its comment update). The logic for cleaning `MigrationDirPath` and creating `RecoveryDirPath` was removed from this function.
        *   `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed entirely.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was added. This function now checks for existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath` and returns an error if any are found, preventing accidental overwrites of recovery data.
        *   In `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, the error handling for `fscrypt` command not found was changed to log an error instead of immediately returning, making it less disruptive.
        *   A minor stylistic change in `checkMigrationDirectory` for initializing the error slice.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM**: Enhanced error handling in `enableIntegrity` to specifically check `result.Compromised()` and join `errIntegrityCompromised` to the returned error, providing more specific integrity violation signaling.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: This file defines the entry point for the Integrity Handler application.
        *   It introduces `ExitCode` constants mirroring systemd service return codes, indicating success, generic failure, incompatibility, or integrity compromise.
        *   The `main` function sets up logging, parses command-line arguments (specifically a mount path), and calls the `run` function.
        *   The `run` function orchestrates the application flow: logging version, initializing application state, calling `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`, `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`. It includes detailed error handling that maps specific application errors to the defined `ExitCode` values.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**:
        *   Provides high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations.
        *   Defines numerous error constants like `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore`, and `ErrFailedToRecover`.
        *   `SetupOnMount`: Manages global and filesystem-specific fscrypt setup.
        *   `EncryptionResult` struct: Tracks the outcomes of encryption attempts for multiple targets (success, already encrypted, and various failure types). It includes `Failed()` to check for hard failures and `BuildError()` to aggregate them.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs`: Iterates through target directories, checks if already encrypted, then calls `encryptTargetDir` for actual encryption, which involves moving contents out, recreating the directory, encrypting, and moving contents back. The `common` import was present.
    *   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**:
        *   The `common` import was temporarily removed, and `tempDir` logic in `EncryptTargetDirs` started using a hardcoded path.
        *   `EncryptionResult`'s `FailedToRecover` field was removed, and `Failed()` and `BuildError()` updated accordingly.
        *   `encryptTargetDir`'s signature and error handling structure were changed, simplifying its role and moving more complex error reconciliation to `EncryptTargetDirs`.
    *   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM** (and subsequent minor timestamps like 4:37:36 PM, 4:40:23 PM, 4:40:46 PM):
        *   The `common` import was re-added.
        *   `ErrFailedToRecover` error constant and `FailedToRecover` field in `EncryptionResult` were restored.
        *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored to use a `switch` statement for clearer handling of global vs. specific mount path setups.
        *   `EncryptTargetDirs` was updated to handle the `encryptTargetDir` return value (a `tempDir` and an `error`) using a `switch` statement, allowing for more specific recovery actions based on the failure type.
    *   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM** (and subsequent minor timestamps up to 12:01:27 PM):
        *   A new method `Compromised()` was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct to specifically indicate if any `FailedToUnlock` errors occurred, marking a compromise.
    *   **12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM** (and subsequent minor timestamps up to 9:44:40 AM):
        *   A new error constant `ErrFailedToClean` was introduced to represent failures in removing temporary migration directories after successful encryption.
        *   The `EncryptionResult` struct was updated to include a `FailedToClean` slice, and the `Failed()` method was adjusted to account for this new failure type.
    *   **12/4/2025, 9:45:00 AM**: The `newEncryptionResult()` function was updated to properly initialize the newly added `FailedToClean` slice.
    *   **12/4/2025, 9:47:07 AM** (and subsequent minor timestamps up to 12/5/2025, 4:07:12 PM):
        *   The `BuildError()` method in `EncryptionResult` was updated to include the `FailedToClean` errors in the composite error message.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/migration.go`**
    *   **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: This is a new file that introduces functions for robust directory migration, crucial for the fscrypt encryption process:
        *   `createNameForTargetDir`: Generates a unique, hashed name for temporary migration directories.
        *   `moveMode` type: Defines options for move operations (error if not empty, or move into existing directory).
        *   `moveIntoDir`: Moves files from a source to an existing destination, with an option to error if the destination is not empty. It relies on `moveWithRsync`.
        *   `moveWithDirOverwrite`: Attempts an `optimizedMove` (using `os.Rename`) first for speed, falling back to `moveWithRsync` if the optimized move fails or if the destination needs to be cleared.
        *   `optimizedMove`: A wrapper around `os.Rename` for efficient moves on the same partition.
        *   `moveWithRsync`: Utilizes the `rsync` command for reliable, content-preserving directory moves, handling scenarios across different partitions and logging `rsync` output on failure.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Copyright and Licensing**: All files begin with a Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025, indicating ownership and current development.
*   **Modularity**: The codebase is structured into `common`, `integrity`, `main`, and `fscrypt` packages, indicating a modular design for the Integrity Handler.
*   **Error Handling Paradigm**: There is a strong emphasis on detailed and structured error handling using Go's `errors` package features (`errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`, `errors.Is`), and custom error types to categorize various failure conditions during encryption and migration. The `EncryptionResult` struct serves as a central mechanism for tracking multiple outcomes.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: The use of `github.com/spf13/afero` (afero.Fs) suggests an abstraction over the native file system, likely for easier testing and mocking.
*   **Security Focus**: The application is explicitly named "Integrity Handler", deals with "FEMK" (File Encryption Master Key), uses `tpm` (Trusted Platform Module), and `vault.SecureContainer` to secure keys, indicating a strong focus on system integrity and cryptographic security.
*   **Idempotency**: Comments repeatedly emphasize the requirement for key functions like `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs` to be idempotent, ensuring that repeated calls do not cause unintended side effects.
*   **Directory Management**: Consistent creation and management of specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/...`) for operation, migration, recovery, and manifest storage. Permissions are explicitly managed, moving from hardcoded values to `common` constants.
*   **Timeliness**: All changes recorded occurred in November and December of 2025, indicating active development during that period.
