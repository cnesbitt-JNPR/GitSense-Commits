# Activity Summary for 12/7/2025

## 12:27:08 AM
The provided log details the evolution of an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption and integrity. Key information includes:

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: This file defines constant paths for the Integrity Handler's operations, including `/boot/integrity` (`BootDirPath`), `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (`EncryptedKeyPath`), `/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store` (`MigrationDirPath`), `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery` (`RecoveryDirPath`), and `/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d` (`ManifestDirPath`). The package comment highlights the use of a secure container for keys at runtime.
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM**: The package comment was slightly rephrased for clarity, but the defined directory paths remain unchanged.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM)**: Establishes the core application logic. It includes `verifyAndInitializeEnvironment` to check system requirements (root privileges, kernel version >= 5.4, fscrypt support, fscrypt command presence, TPM initialization). `enableIntegrity` handles the encryption process, including directory creation, FEMK (Filesystem Encryption Master Key) resolution, fscrypt setup, and target directory encryption. `unlockEncryptedDirs` handles unlocking. `getFsKey` securely retrieves the filesystem key, wiping it from memory after use. `ensureDirectoriesExist` sets up necessary paths, initially including logic to clean the migration directory and create a recovery directory. `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` checks for leftover recovery data. A minor change on **11/21/2025, 2:28:49 PM** removed the `afero.Exists` check in `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`, leading to a direct `ReadDir` call and a potentially flawed warning message logic.
    *   **Major Refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM - 4:42:37 PM)**:
        *   The failure to find the `fscrypt` command during environment verification was downgraded from a fatal error to a logged warning.
        *   `ensureDirectoriesExist` was significantly simplified, removing internal cleanup and hardcoded permissions, instead relying on new, unshown `common` constants (`MigrationDirPerms`, `ManifestDirPerms`, `BootDirPerms`). The creation of `RecoveryDirPath` was removed from this function.
        *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was removed entirely.
        *   A new function, `checkMigrationDirectory`, was introduced to explicitly check for and error on existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath` to prevent data loss.
        *   Minor syntax improvements for slice initialization.
    *   **Error Handling Refinement (12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM - 2:04:54 PM)**: Modified the `enableIntegrity` function to correctly wrap the `errIntegrityCompromised` error when `EncryptionResult` indicates a compromised state, ensuring accurate error reporting.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
    *   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Initial commit of the main application entry point. It defines `ExitCode` constants, embeds the version string, parses command-line flags (specifically `-mount`), and orchestrates the application flow by calling `run()`. The `run()` function calls the `IntegrityHandler`'s core functions, handling various exit codes based on success, environment incompatibility, or integrity compromise. It initially calls `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings()`, which was later removed from `integrity.go`.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **Initial State (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM)**: Defines high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. Includes numerous custom error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`), the `protectorName` constant "FEMK", and the `SetupOnMount` function for global and filesystem setup. The `EncryptionResult` struct tracks detailed outcomes of encryption attempts, including `Success`, `AlreadyEncrypted`, and various `FailedTo...` categories. `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` implement the core encryption and data migration logic. `encryptTargetDir` initially took `*EncryptionResult` as an argument.
    *   **Refactor & `common` Removal/Re-addition (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM - 12/1/2025, 4:40:46 PM)**:
        *   On **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**, `FailedToRecover` was removed from `EncryptionResult` struct and its related methods. Crucially, the `common` package import was temporarily removed, leading to hardcoded paths in `EncryptTargetDirs`. The `encryptTargetDir` function signature changed to return `(string, error)`, shifting error categorization to the caller.
        *   On **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**, the `common` import was re-added. The `ErrFailedToRecover` error variable was reintroduced (though not yet added back to the `EncryptionResult` struct). `SetupOnMount` was enhanced with a `switch` statement for more flexible global vs. specific mount point setup, specifically for upgrade scenarios.
    *   **Compromise Tracking (12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM - 12:01:27 PM)**: A `Compromised()` method was added to `EncryptionResult`, returning `true` if `FailedToUnlock` contains any entries, providing a specific flag for integrity breaches.
    *   **Cleanup Error Handling (12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM - 9:57:01 AM)**:
        *   On **12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM**, `ErrFailedToClean` was introduced as a new error type for post-encryption cleanup failures.
        *   On **12/4/2025, 9:44:40 AM**, `FailedToClean` was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct and incorporated into the `Failed()` method calculation.
        *   On **12/4/2025, 9:47:07 AM**, `BuildError()` was updated to include `FailedToClean` in the composite error message.

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/migration.go`**
    *   **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: This new file was introduced to encapsulate directory and file migration utilities. It defines `createNameForTargetDir` to generate unique names (using SHA256 hash), and various `move` functions (`moveIntoDir`, `moveWithDirOverwrite`, `optimizedMove`, `moveWithRsync`). These functions manage file relocation, prioritizing `os.Rename` for efficiency and falling back to `rsync` for robustness across partitions.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM**: Initial definition of common directory paths.
*   **11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM**: Initial core logic for Integrity Handler (environment checks, encryption flow, error handling).
*   **11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM**: Introduction of the `main.go` entry point.
*   **11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM**: Initial `fscrypt` package implementation for encryption.
*   **11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM**: Major refactor in `fscrypt.go`, temporary removal of `common` import and `FailedToRecover`, change in `encryptTargetDir`'s error handling strategy.
*   **12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM**: Re-introduction of `common` import and `ErrFailedToRecover` (as error variable), and improved `SetupOnMount` logic in `fscrypt.go`. Major simplification of `ensureDirectoriesExist` and introduction of `checkMigrationDirectory` in `integrity.go`.
*   **12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM**: Addition of `Compromised()` method to `EncryptionResult` in `fscrypt.go`.
*   **12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM**: Correction in `enableIntegrity` error handling in `integrity.go` for compromised states.
*   **12/4/2025, 9:44:40 AM**: `FailedToClean` added to `EncryptionResult` struct and its methods in `fscrypt.go`.
*   **12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM**: Introduction of `migration.go` for dedicated file movement utilities.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Security and Integrity Focus**: The entire codebase, named "Integrity Handler," is dedicated to ensuring filesystem integrity through encryption (`fscrypt`), TPM integration, and robust error handling that flags "integrity compromised" states.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: A consistent pattern of defining specific error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`) and collecting them into an `EncryptionResult` struct is evident across `integrity.go` and `fscrypt.go`. This allows for detailed reporting of partial successes and failures. The `BuildError()` method for `EncryptionResult` aggregates these specific errors into a comprehensive message.
*   **Idempotency**: Several functions, explicitly `enableIntegrity` and `EncryptTargetDirs`, are designed to be idempotent, meaning they can be run multiple times without unintended side effects, crucial for system reliability.
*   **Directory Management and Permissions**: There's a strong emphasis on managing specific directories (`/boot/integrity`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/...`) with defined permissions and dedicated functions (`ensureDirectoriesExist`, `checkMigrationDirectory`). There's a clear move towards centralizing directory path and permission definitions in the `common` package.
*   **External Tool Integration**: The application relies on external tools like `fscrypt` (both as a Go library and a command-line utility) and `rsync` for core functionality, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to leveraging existing, robust tools.
*   **Iterative Development**: The log shows a clear progression from initial setup to refactoring, adding more granular error handling, and modularizing code into new files (`migration.go`). The frequent, small changes within a short period (late November to early December 2025) suggest active development and refinement.

## 2:26:57 AM
The code changes primarily revolve around an "Integrity Handler" application written in Go, focusing on filesystem encryption using `fscrypt` and TPM/vTPM integration.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/common/directories.go`**
*   **Initial state (11/21/2025, 2:26:50 PM)**: Defined constants for critical directory paths, including `/boot/integrity`, `/boot/integrity/femk.enc` (for the encrypted key), migration paths (`/opt/128technology/integrity/.migration-store`, `/opt/128technology/integrity/migration-recovery`), and manifest paths (`/opt/128technology/integrity/manifest.d`).
*   **Minor comment update (11/21/2025, 4:02:40 PM)**: The package comment was clarified from describing a secure container to stating it "contains common globals used throughout Integrity Handler." No functional change.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/integrity.go`**
*   **Initial development (11/21/2025, 2:27:15 PM - 2:40:35 PM)**: Introduced core functions for verifying the environment (`verifyAndInitializeEnvironment`), enabling and unlocking integrity (`enableIntegrity`, `unlockEncryptedDirs`), retrieving the filesystem key (`getFsKey`), ensuring necessary directories exist (`ensureDirectoriesExist`), and handling recovery warnings (`handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings`). Environment verification includes checks for root privileges, kernel version (>= 5.4), and filesystem encryption support via `fscrypt`.
*   **Significant Refactoring (12/1/2025, 4:38:57 PM)**:
    *   The `ensureDirectoriesExist` function was streamlined. It removed the internal `perms` variable, opting instead to use permission constants (`common.MigrationDirPerms`, `common.ManifestDirPerms`, `common.BootDirPerms`) which implies these constants were added to the `common` package (though not explicitly shown in the `directories.go` log entries).
    *   The logic for cleaning the migration directory and creating the recovery directory was removed from `ensureDirectoriesExist`.
    *   A new function `checkMigrationDirectory` was introduced to explicitly check for and error on existing contents in `common.MigrationDirPath`, preventing potential data loss from failed prior migrations.
    *   The `handleRecoveryDirectoryWarnings` function was entirely removed.
    *   Error logging for `fscrypt` command lookup was changed from returning an error to logging it.
*   **Minor fix (12/1/2025, 4:42:37 PM)**: A minor syntax update in `checkMigrationDirectory` for declaring the `errs` slice.
*   **Error Handling Enhancement (12/3/2025, 11:57:46 AM)**: The error handling in `enableIntegrity` was enhanced to check if an `EncryptionResult` indicates a "compromised" state (implying a new `Compromised()` method on `EncryptionResult` in `fscrypt.go`), and if so, it will join the resulting error with `errIntegrityCompromised`.
*   **Error Wrapping Correction (12/3/2025, 2:04:54 PM)**: In `enableIntegrity`, the error joining for compromised state was corrected from `errors.Join(err, errIntegrityCompromised)` to `err = fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", errIntegrityCompromised, err)` for proper error wrapping.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/main.go`**
*   **Initial implementation (11/21/2025, 4:00:45 PM)**: Defined `ExitCode` constants for different application exit statuses (Success, Failure, Incompatible, Compromised). The `main` function initializes logging, parses a `mount` path argument, and calls `run`. The `run` function orchestrates the Integrity Handler's workflow, including version logging, environment verification, calling `enableIntegrity`, and `unlockEncryptedDirs`, with specific exit codes based on the outcome (e.g., `ExitCompromised` for integrity violations).

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
*   **Initial development (11/21/2025, 4:11:30 PM)**: Introduced high-level wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. Defined numerous error variables for specific failure conditions (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`). It included `SetupOnMount` for `fscrypt` global and filesystem setup, and an `EncryptionResult` struct to track outcomes of encryption attempts. The `EncryptTargetDirs` and `encryptTargetDir` functions began to define the encryption workflow.
*   **Error Granularity & `EncryptionResult` Refinement (11/25/2025, 4:04:34 PM)**:
    *   New explicit error variables `ErrFailedToEncrypt`, `ErrFailedToUnlock`, `ErrFailedToRestore` were defined.
    *   The `EncryptionResult` struct and its `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated to include these new, more granular failure types. `FailedToRecover` was removed from `EncryptionResult` fields.
    *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function gained a `switch` statement for improved error handling from `encryptTargetDir`, including success cleanup logic.
    *   *Brief removal then re-addition of `common` package import:* The `common` package import was temporarily removed in this change but restored in the next.
*   **`SetupOnMount` Logic Enhancement (12/1/2025, 4:37:06 PM)**:
    *   The `common` package import was restored.
    *   A new error variable `ErrFailedToRecover` was re-added.
    *   `SetupOnMount` was refactored with a `switch` statement to differentiate between global setup (for mount paths like "" or "/") and filesystem-specific setup, clarifying the expected setup flow during upgrades.
    *   The `EncryptTargetDirs` function was updated to capture `tempDir` and `err` from `encryptTargetDir` for more detailed error handling.
*   **Added `Compromised()` Method (12/3/2025, 11:58:10 AM)**: A new `Compromised()` method was added to the `EncryptionResult` struct, returning `true` if `FailedToUnlock` contains any entries. This directly supports the updated error handling in `integrity.go`.
*   **Added `ErrFailedToClean` and Tracking (12/4/2025, 9:38:27 AM)**:
    *   A new error variable `ErrFailedToClean` was added, specifically for failures in removing temporary migration directories after successful encryption.
    *   `EncryptionResult` was updated to include a `FailedToClean []string` field.
    *   The `Failed()` and `BuildError()` methods were updated to incorporate this new failure type.

**`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/migration.go`**
*   **Initial implementation (12/5/2025, 3:57:38 PM)**: This file was introduced to encapsulate directory migration logic. It provides functions to:
    *   `createNameForTargetDir`: Generate a unique, hash-based name for a temporary directory.
    *   `moveIntoDir`: Move contents from a source to a destination, with options to error if the destination is not empty.
    *   `moveWithDirOverwrite`: A more robust move function that attempts an `optimizedMove` (using `os.Rename`) first, falling back to `moveWithRsync` if the optimized move fails or if the destination needs to be cleared (by removing it first if not empty).
    *   `optimizedMove`: Uses `os.Rename` for efficient moves within the same partition.
    *   `moveWithRsync`: Uses `rsync` for more robust, cross-partition file transfers.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:
*   **Copyright Notice**: All files begin with the same Juniper Networks copyright notice, dated 2025.
*   **Juniper SSN Context**: Imports like `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log` indicate the code is part of the Juniper SSN project.
*   **Security and Integrity Focus**: The entire codebase is dedicated to an "Integrity Handler" that manages encrypted directories (FEMK, fscrypt), utilizes TPM/vTPM, and meticulously tracks various failure modes related to encryption and data integrity.
*   **Robust Error Handling**: A significant portion of the changes involves defining specific error types, wrapping errors (`fmt.Errorf("%w: %w", ...)`, `errors.Join`), and creating a detailed `EncryptionResult` struct to provide granular feedback on the success or failure of encryption operations.
*   **Filesystem Abstraction**: Consistent use of `github.com/spf13/afero` for filesystem operations, likely for testability and portability.
*   **Idempotency**: Multiple functions are explicitly commented as needing to be idempotent, indicating a design goal for reliable, repeatable operations.
*   **Migration/Recovery Workflow**: There's a clear pattern of migrating directory contents out, performing an operation (like encryption), and then migrating contents back, with built-in recovery and cleanup considerations. The evolution shows increasing sophistication in handling partial failures and ensuring data integrity during these migrations.
*   **TODO Comments**: Numerous "TODO" comments indicate ongoing development or future enhancements, particularly around idempotent flows, context plumbing, processing manifests, and directory creation during installation.
