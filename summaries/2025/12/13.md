**Patterns/Recurring Elements (within the known_hosts file structure, without revealing specific keys):**
The log entry for the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file indicates a pattern of adding multiple host keys. Each host entry includes an IP address (or hostname like `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`), potentially a port number (e.g., `[10.27.15.13]:12811`), and is followed by one or more public host keys using different algorithms: `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`. Many IP addresses in the 10.27.x.x range are present, indicating connections to various internal network hosts.
