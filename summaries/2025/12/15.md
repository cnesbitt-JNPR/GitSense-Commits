# Activity Summary for 12/15/2025

## 1:49:02 AM
The provided log details a single code change.

**File Path:** `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`
**Timestamp:** This file was updated on `12/2/2025, 4:09:09 PM`.
**Summary of Changes:** Due to its nature as a file storing SSH host keys, which are sensitive security credentials, the specific content of `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` will not be summarized. It typically contains public host keys for various remote servers the user has connected to, using algorithms like `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`. The update indicates that new host keys were added or existing ones were modified for several IP addresses (e.g., `10.27.15.13`, `10.27.36.239`, `10.27.40.88`, `10.27.35.50`, `10.27.36.198`, `10.27.33.172`, `10.27.35.34`, `10.27.35.129`, `10.27.35.27`, `10.27.34.241`, `10.27.34.127`, `10.27.35.202`, `10.27.15.156`, `10.27.60.106`, `10.27.14.35`, `10.27.15.239`, `10.27.34.189`) and a local address `[127.0.0.1]:12805`, as well as a specific Juniper launchpad server.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
The content primarily consists of entries for different hosts, each followed by one or more SSH public keys.
*   Multiple key types are present: `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`.
*   Many entries are for IP addresses within the `10.27.X.X` range, suggesting connections to an internal network.
*   Some entries include specific ports, such as `[10.27.15.13]:12811` and `[127.0.0.1]:12805`.
*   The `AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI` and `AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABgQ` and `AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBB` prefixes are standard base64 encodings for `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` public keys respectively.
