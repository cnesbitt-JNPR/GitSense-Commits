# Activity Summary for 1/7/2026

## 3:19:36 AM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`.

**File-specific updates and timestamps:**
*   `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`: This file was updated on 1/6/2026, 4:36:38 PM. As this file potentially stores sensitive authentication keys, its content will not be summarized as per the instructions.

**Patterns or recurring elements (based on the presence of the file type):**
The presence of `known_hosts` indicates configurations related to SSH, typically used for securely connecting to remote servers. This file records public host keys of SSH servers the user has connected to, to verify the identity of the servers in subsequent connections and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. The detailed content would include various hostnames and IP addresses (`launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, `10.27.15.13`, `10.27.36.239`, etc., including local `127.0.0.1`) paired with different SSH key types (e.g., `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`), indicating connections to multiple distinct hosts and different key exchange algorithms.
