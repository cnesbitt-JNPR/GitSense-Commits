# Activity Summary for 1/12/2026

## 3:19:40 AM
The `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file was updated on 1/6/2026, 4:36:38 PM. The content of this file, which stores SSH host keys, shows the addition or modification of entries for several hosts.

**File-specific updates for `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`:**
The file contains entries for `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, various IP addresses within the `10.27.x.x` range, and `127.0.0.1` (localhost). Many entries include a port number, specifically `12811` for `10.27.15.13` and `12805` for `127.0.0.1`.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
The only timestamp provided is 1/6/2026, 4:36:38 PM, indicating a single recorded update event for the `known_hosts` file.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**
A strong pattern is the inclusion of multiple host key types for many hosts. Specifically, entries often appear in triplets, including `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` keys for the same hostname or IP address. For example, `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, `10.27.15.13`, `10.27.15.13:12811`, `10.27.35.50`, `10.27.35.34`, `10.27.35.129`, `10.27.35.27`, `10.27.60.106`, `10.27.14.35`, `10.27.34.189`, and `[127.0.0.1]:12805` all have entries for these three algorithms. Some IPs like `10.27.36.239`, `10.27.40.88`, `10.27.36.198`, `10.27.33.172`, `10.27.34.241`, `10.27.15.156`, `10.27.15.239` primarily show `ssh-ed25519` and sometimes `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` keys. The `10.27.34.127` and `10.27.35.202` entries only list `ssh-rsa` keys. The recurrence of specific IP ranges (e.g., `10.27.x.x`) suggests connections to an internal network segment.

## 4:19:36 AM
The provided log contains changes for a single file, `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`, with a timestamp of 1/6/2026, 4:36:38 PM.

Due to the sensitive nature of the `.ssh/known_hosts` file, which contains public host keys for SSH connections and is critical for security, its content will not be summarized or analyzed. Summarizing such content would expose potentially sensitive infrastructure details and public key fingerprints.

## 5:19:35 AM
The provided log details changes to a `.ssh/known_hosts` file, which typically stores cryptographic keys. As per the instructions, no summary will be generated for filepaths containing sensitive keys.
