The log records changes to the SSH `known_hosts` file at `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts**: This file was updated on 1/6/2026, 4:36:38 PM. The content consists of a list of public host keys associated with various hosts.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**

The `known_hosts` file contains entries for multiple hosts, each typically specifying:
*   **Host Identifiers**: These include a domain name (`launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`), IP addresses (primarily in the `10.27.x.x` range, but also `127.0.0.1`), and sometimes an IP address with a specific port (e.g., `[10.27.15.13]:12811`, `[127.0.0.1]:12805`).
*   **Key Types**: For each host, multiple key types are often recorded, most commonly:
    *   `ssh-ed25519`
    *   `ssh-rsa`
    *   `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`
*   **Public Keys**: Each key type is followed by its corresponding base64-encoded public key string.

The general pattern for each entry is `[host_identifier] [key_type] [public_key]`. There are numerous entries for different IP addresses within the `10.27.x.x` subnet, indicating connections to various internal network devices or services. The presence of `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` suggests interaction with Juniper systems, and `127.0.0.1` entries with specific ports imply local or tunneled connections.
