# Activity Summary for 1/15/2026

## 12:41:58 AM
The provided log details changes across two Go source files (`reboot.go`, `reboot_internal_test.go`) and one systemd service definition file (`systemd.service`) related to an `IntegrityHandler` application. The primary focus is on a system reboot logic, its testing, and how it integrates with systemd. A new file `fscrypt.go` is also introduced, outlining filesystem encryption functionalities.

**File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/reboot_internal_test.go`**
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:27:04 PM:** An extensive test suite for the reboot handler logic is introduced. This includes tests for loading, clearing, and incrementing failure counts, handling different exit codes (success, failure, incompatible, compromised), bypassing reboots via a touch file, and verifying immediate vs. delayed reboot types. It utilizes `afero.NewMemMapFs()` for isolated filesystem testing.
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:28:24 PM** and **3:28:36 PM:** Minor robustness improvements are added to test cases, specifically by asserting `NoError` after `fs.Remove` calls in `TestLoadFailureCount` and `TestBypassTouchFile`.
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:29:13 PM** and **3:45:42 PM:** The `TestClearFailureCount` function is updated to check for errors returned by `handler.clearFailureCount()`, indicating a change in the `clearFailureCount` method's signature or expected behavior in the main `reboot.go` file.
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:44:46 PM:** A consistent pattern emerges where all calls to the test setup helper `setupTestFs()` are updated to pass `t` as an argument (`setupTestFs(t)`). This allows for better test reporting.
    *   **1/14/2026, 4:00:52 PM** and **4:01:04 PM:** The `t.Helper()` call is added to the `setupTestFs` and `testSuccessfulExistCode` helper functions, further enhancing test error reporting by marking them as helpers.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/reboot.go`**
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:43:42 PM:** The core `rebootHandler` implementation is introduced. It defines constants like `maxFailureCount` (4), `failcountFilename` ("attempts.count"), and `noRebootFilename` ("no_reboot.touch"). It includes functions to load, clear, and increment failure counts from a file, and a `handleRetryLogic` function that decides when to trigger an immediate or delayed system reboot based on exit codes and the failure count. It also defines a `rebootSystem` function that executes `sudo /sbin/shutdown`.
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:52:06 PM:** The `handleRetryLogic` function is refactored for better modularity. Its two main branches for success and maximum failure limit are extracted into new private methods: `handleSuccess()` and `handleMaxFailureLimit()`.
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:59:53 PM:** Functions `handleSuccess` and `handleMaxFailureLimit` are reordered within the file, moving them after `loadFailureCount`. This is a stylistic change with no functional impact.
    *   **1/14/2026, 4:00:15 PM:** A minor stylistic change in the `rebootSystem` method's receiver signature, changing `func (_ *rebootHandler)` to `func (*rebootHandler)`, indicating the receiver variable is not used within the method.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/packaging/systemd.service`**
    *   **1/14/2026, 4:12:24 PM:** This systemd service unit file is updated. It defines the Integrity Handler as a critical `oneshot` service that runs early in the boot process. It specifies `SuccessExitStatus=0 1 6`, `Restart=on-failure`, and `RestartSec=30`, aligning with the reboot logic in `reboot.go`. An `ExecStopPost` command is included to log a critical message if `ExitCode 78` (ExitCompromised) is returned. The service's dependencies (`Before=` and `RequiredBy=`) are updated to include a new `gibberish-x86-for-testing.service`, suggesting integration with testing infrastructure.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **1/14/2026, 4:14:12 PM:** A new file is introduced, providing high-level Go wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines a set of specific error types for various encryption and migration failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`). The core `EncryptTargetDirs` function is introduced, designed to be idempotent and include robust error handling with partial recovery mechanisms for certain failures (e.g., `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`). For critical errors like `ErrFailedToUnlock` (integrity event), it logs the error but continues processing other targets without attempting recovery.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Integrity and Recovery:** The overarching theme is system integrity and recovery. The `IntegrityHandler` monitors for issues and orchestrates reboots to restore a stable state, while the `fscrypt` package aims to secure data through encryption.
*   **Go Testing Best Practices:** The `reboot_internal_test.go` file demonstrates strong adherence to Go testing best practices, including the use of in-memory filesystems (`afero`), robust assertions (`testify/assert`), and marking helper functions (`t.Helper()`) for clearer error reporting.
*   **Systemd Integration:** The systemd service file is tightly coupled with the Go application's logic, particularly regarding exit codes, restart behavior, and boot order. The `maxFailureCount` in Go (4) combined with `RestartSec` (30s) in systemd leads to a 2-minute retry window before the Go application itself forces a reboot.
*   **File-based State Management:** The reboot logic relies on simple file-based state (`attempts.count`, `no_reboot.touch`) for persistence across application runs and reboots, stored in a `common.BootDirPath`.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Both `reboot.go` and `fscrypt.go` exhibit detailed error checking and informative logging (`log.Errorf`, `log.Infof`, `log.Debugf`) to aid in debugging and operational monitoring.
*   **Idempotency and Recovery:** The `fscrypt.go` encryption functions are designed to be idempotent and include explicit recovery steps for various failure scenarios during the encryption and file migration process.
*   **Copyright Notices:** All Go files consistently include a "Copyright (c) Juniper Networks, Inc. 2026. All rights reserved." header.

## 3:41:55 AM
The changes primarily focus on two Go files, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/reboot_internal_test.go` and `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/reboot.go`, along with a systemd service file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/packaging/systemd.service` and an initial commit for `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`. All modifications occurred on January 14, 2026, indicating a concentrated development effort.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/reboot_internal_test.go (Multiple timestamps from 3:27:04 PM to 4:01:04 PM):**
    *   Initial changes focused on making tests more robust by adding error checks (`assert.NoError(t, err)`) for file system operations (`fs.Remove`, `handler.clearFailureCount()`).
    *   Subsequent updates involved passing the `*testing.T` object to the `setupTestFs` helper function in all test calls (e.g., `setupTestFs(t)`).
    *   The `t.Helper()` call was added to both `setupTestFs` and `testSuccessfulExistCode` functions to improve test reporting by marking them as test helper functions.
    *   One commit clarified an existing `handler.clearFailureCount()` call by assigning its error return to `err` and asserting `NoError`.
    *   The overall content of this file consists of unit tests for the reboot logic, covering scenarios such as loading and clearing failure counts, incrementing counts, handling various exit codes (success, failure, incompatible, compromised), bypassing reboots via a touch file, and triggering immediate vs. delayed reboots.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/reboot.go (Multiple timestamps from 3:43:42 PM to 4:00:15 PM):**
    *   The initial version defined the `rebootHandler` struct, methods for handling retry logic (`handleRetryLogic`), managing a failure count (`loadFailureCount`, `clearFailureCount`, `incrementFailureCount`), and performing system reboots (`rebootSystem`). It also established constants like `maxFailureCount` (set to 4) and filenames for tracking attempts and bypass.
    *   A significant refactoring occurred at 3:52:06 PM, extracting parts of the `handleRetryLogic` into two new, more specific methods: `handleSuccess()` and `handleMaxFailureLimit()`. This improved the modularity and readability of the `handleRetryLogic` function.
    *   A minor change at 3:59:53 PM involved reordering the `handleSuccess` and `handleMaxFailureLimit` method definitions within the file without altering their functionality.
    *   Another minor change at 4:00:15 PM updated the receiver of the `rebootSystem` method from `(_ *rebootHandler)` to `(*rebootHandler)`, a stylistic change in Go to indicate the receiver value is used.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/packaging/systemd.service (Timestamp: 1/14/2026, 4:12:24 PM):**
    *   This file defines a systemd service unit for the Integrity Handler. It specifies dependencies (`Wants`, `After`, `Before`, `RequiredBy`) with numerous `128T` and related services.
    *   Key service properties include `Type=oneshot`, `RemainAfterExit=yes`, `ExecStart=/usr/libexec/integrity-handler`, and `TimeoutSec=30`.
    *   Crucially, `SuccessExitStatus` is explicitly set to `0 1 6`, indicating which exit codes are considered successful by systemd's retry logic. `Restart` is `on-failure` with `RestartSec=30`, coupling with the `maxFailureCount` in `reboot.go` for controlled reboots.
    *   It also includes `ExecStopPost` for logging critical integrity events and security hardening directives (`NoNewPrivileges=true`, `PrivateTmp=true`).
    *   A new service `gibberish-x86-for-testing.service` was added to both `Before` and `RequiredBy` lists.

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go (Timestamp: 1/14/2026, 4:14:12 PM):**
    *   This is an initial commit of a new Go file defining a `fscrypt` package. It provides high-level wrappers for fscrypt operations.
    *   It declares numerous custom error types (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`), indicating a detailed error handling strategy.
    *   The `APIWrapper` struct manages application state, including a filesystem key and mount path.
    *   Methods like `SetupOnMount` are designed to configure fscrypt globally or on specific mount points, with idempotency built-in.
    *   `EncryptTargetDirs` is a central function for encrypting directories, handling pre-checks (if already encrypted) and extensive error recovery logic for various stages of the encryption and data migration process. Logging is used extensively for debugging and error reporting. The copyright is set to 2025.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **IntegrityHandler Context:** All modified files are part of an "Integrity Handler" application, suggesting a system designed to maintain and recover system integrity, potentially via reboots and file system encryption.
*   **Go Language and Testing:** The Go files demonstrate standard Go programming practices, including structured code, error handling, and robust unit testing using `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` and `github.com/spf13/afero` for abstracting file system operations in tests. The use of `t.Helper()` indicates attention to test clarity and reporting.
*   **Reboot Logic:** A core recurring theme is the logic for triggering reboots based on the success or failure of operations, tracked via a "failure count" file (`attempts.count`) and a bypass mechanism (`no_reboot.touch`). This mechanism integrates with systemd's `Restart=on-failure` and `RestartSec`.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Both `reboot.go` and `fscrypt.go` show a strong emphasis on explicit error checking and logging (using `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`) for different severity levels (Info, Debug, Error), ensuring operational transparency and easier debugging.
*   **Idempotency and Recovery:** The `fscrypt.go` file specifically highlights the intention for `EncryptTargetDirs` to be idempotent and includes detailed recovery steps for various failure points during the encryption process, indicating a robust design for critical operations.
*   **Copyrights:** All Go files consistently include a Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2026 (or 2025 for `fscrypt.go`).
*   **Boot Directory Focus:** Operations frequently involve `/boot/`, indicated by `common.BootDirPath`, for storing state files related to integrity and reboot attempts.
