# Activity Summary for 1/15/2026

## 12:41:58 AM
The provided log details changes across two Go source files (`reboot.go`, `reboot_internal_test.go`) and one systemd service definition file (`systemd.service`) related to an `IntegrityHandler` application. The primary focus is on a system reboot logic, its testing, and how it integrates with systemd. A new file `fscrypt.go` is also introduced, outlining filesystem encryption functionalities.

**File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

1.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/reboot_internal_test.go`**
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:27:04 PM:** An extensive test suite for the reboot handler logic is introduced. This includes tests for loading, clearing, and incrementing failure counts, handling different exit codes (success, failure, incompatible, compromised), bypassing reboots via a touch file, and verifying immediate vs. delayed reboot types. It utilizes `afero.NewMemMapFs()` for isolated filesystem testing.
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:28:24 PM** and **3:28:36 PM:** Minor robustness improvements are added to test cases, specifically by asserting `NoError` after `fs.Remove` calls in `TestLoadFailureCount` and `TestBypassTouchFile`.
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:29:13 PM** and **3:45:42 PM:** The `TestClearFailureCount` function is updated to check for errors returned by `handler.clearFailureCount()`, indicating a change in the `clearFailureCount` method's signature or expected behavior in the main `reboot.go` file.
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:44:46 PM:** A consistent pattern emerges where all calls to the test setup helper `setupTestFs()` are updated to pass `t` as an argument (`setupTestFs(t)`). This allows for better test reporting.
    *   **1/14/2026, 4:00:52 PM** and **4:01:04 PM:** The `t.Helper()` call is added to the `setupTestFs` and `testSuccessfulExistCode` helper functions, further enhancing test error reporting by marking them as helpers.

2.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/reboot.go`**
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:43:42 PM:** The core `rebootHandler` implementation is introduced. It defines constants like `maxFailureCount` (4), `failcountFilename` ("attempts.count"), and `noRebootFilename` ("no_reboot.touch"). It includes functions to load, clear, and increment failure counts from a file, and a `handleRetryLogic` function that decides when to trigger an immediate or delayed system reboot based on exit codes and the failure count. It also defines a `rebootSystem` function that executes `sudo /sbin/shutdown`.
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:52:06 PM:** The `handleRetryLogic` function is refactored for better modularity. Its two main branches for success and maximum failure limit are extracted into new private methods: `handleSuccess()` and `handleMaxFailureLimit()`.
    *   **1/14/2026, 3:59:53 PM:** Functions `handleSuccess` and `handleMaxFailureLimit` are reordered within the file, moving them after `loadFailureCount`. This is a stylistic change with no functional impact.
    *   **1/14/2026, 4:00:15 PM:** A minor stylistic change in the `rebootSystem` method's receiver signature, changing `func (_ *rebootHandler)` to `func (*rebootHandler)`, indicating the receiver variable is not used within the method.

3.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/packaging/systemd.service`**
    *   **1/14/2026, 4:12:24 PM:** This systemd service unit file is updated. It defines the Integrity Handler as a critical `oneshot` service that runs early in the boot process. It specifies `SuccessExitStatus=0 1 6`, `Restart=on-failure`, and `RestartSec=30`, aligning with the reboot logic in `reboot.go`. An `ExecStopPost` command is included to log a critical message if `ExitCode 78` (ExitCompromised) is returned. The service's dependencies (`Before=` and `RequiredBy=`) are updated to include a new `gibberish-x86-for-testing.service`, suggesting integration with testing infrastructure.

4.  **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/fscrypt/fscrypt.go`**
    *   **1/14/2026, 4:14:12 PM:** A new file is introduced, providing high-level Go wrappers for `fscrypt` operations. It defines a set of specific error types for various encryption and migration failures (e.g., `ErrTargetAlreadyEncrypted`, `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`). The core `EncryptTargetDirs` function is introduced, designed to be idempotent and include robust error handling with partial recovery mechanisms for certain failures (e.g., `ErrFailedToRelocate`, `ErrFailedToEncrypt`). For critical errors like `ErrFailedToUnlock` (integrity event), it logs the error but continues processing other targets without attempting recovery.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Integrity and Recovery:** The overarching theme is system integrity and recovery. The `IntegrityHandler` monitors for issues and orchestrates reboots to restore a stable state, while the `fscrypt` package aims to secure data through encryption.
*   **Go Testing Best Practices:** The `reboot_internal_test.go` file demonstrates strong adherence to Go testing best practices, including the use of in-memory filesystems (`afero`), robust assertions (`testify/assert`), and marking helper functions (`t.Helper()`) for clearer error reporting.
*   **Systemd Integration:** The systemd service file is tightly coupled with the Go application's logic, particularly regarding exit codes, restart behavior, and boot order. The `maxFailureCount` in Go (4) combined with `RestartSec` (30s) in systemd leads to a 2-minute retry window before the Go application itself forces a reboot.
*   **File-based State Management:** The reboot logic relies on simple file-based state (`attempts.count`, `no_reboot.touch`) for persistence across application runs and reboots, stored in a `common.BootDirPath`.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Both `reboot.go` and `fscrypt.go` exhibit detailed error checking and informative logging (`log.Errorf`, `log.Infof`, `log.Debugf`) to aid in debugging and operational monitoring.
*   **Idempotency and Recovery:** The `fscrypt.go` encryption functions are designed to be idempotent and include explicit recovery steps for various failure scenarios during the encryption and file migration process.
