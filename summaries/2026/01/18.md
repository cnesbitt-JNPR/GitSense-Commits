# Activity Summary for 1/18/2026

## 12:50:11 AM
The log entry details a modification to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file, timestamped `1/6/2026, 4:36:38 PM`. As this file stores sensitive SSH host keys, its specific content will not be summarized as per the instructions.

However, the file update indicates the addition or modification of numerous SSH host key entries. The entries consistently include hostnames (e.g., `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`) and various IP addresses (primarily in the `10.27.x.x` range, and `127.0.0.1`), some specified with particular ports (e.g., `:12811`, `:12805`). For each host or IP, multiple types of SSH public keys are recorded, specifically `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`. This pattern suggests the system connected to a variety of internal network hosts using different SSH key algorithms, and their public keys were added to the `known_hosts` file to authenticate future connections.
