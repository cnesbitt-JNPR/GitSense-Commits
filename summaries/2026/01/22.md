# Activity Summary for 1/22/2026

## 3:50:10 AM
The log details multiple changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file across several timestamps.

Due to the sensitive nature of the `known_hosts` file, which stores SSH host keys, no summary of its specific content changes will be generated as per the instructions to avoid summarizing files that may store keys.

However, the file was updated on the following significant timestamps:
*   January 6, 2026, 4:36:38 PM
*   January 21, 2026, 11:05:15 AM
*   January 21, 2026, 3:38:08 PM

The recurring pattern is that the `known_hosts` file itself was modified multiple times within a short period, specifically in January 2026. Each change log shows the entire content of the file at that specific timestamp, indicating additions or modifications to the list of known SSH hosts and their corresponding keys.
