# Activity Summary for 1/22/2026

## 3:50:10 AM
The log details multiple changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file across several timestamps.

Due to the sensitive nature of the `known_hosts` file, which stores SSH host keys, no summary of its specific content changes will be generated as per the instructions to avoid summarizing files that may store keys.

However, the file was updated on the following significant timestamps:
*   January 6, 2026, 4:36:38 PM
*   January 21, 2026, 11:05:15 AM
*   January 21, 2026, 3:38:08 PM

The recurring pattern is that the `known_hosts` file itself was modified multiple times within a short period, specifically in January 2026. Each change log shows the entire content of the file at that specific timestamp, indicating additions or modifications to the list of known SSH hosts and their corresponding keys.

## 4:50:15 AM
The log primarily details changes to a single file: `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`.

**File-Specific Updates and Timestamps:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`**
    *   This file, which stores SSH host keys, underwent modifications across three distinct timestamps:
        *   **1/6/2026, 4:36:38 PM:** Initial state recorded in the log, containing various SSH host key entries for `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, several `10.27.x.x` IP addresses, and `[127.0.0.1]:12805`.
        *   **1/21/2026, 11:05:15 AM:** The content of the file at this timestamp is identical to the one recorded on 1/6/2026, indicating no new host keys were added or removed in the interim.
        *   **1/21/2026, 3:38:08 PM:** A significant update occurred. New SSH host key entries were appended to the file for `[127.0.0.1]:12801` and `[127.0.0.1]:12807`.

Due to the sensitive nature of storing keys, the explicit content of these entries (the actual key strings) is not summarized, adhering to security best practices.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in Content (Structural):**

The file consistently stores entries in the format of `[hostname/IP:port] key-type key-string`.
*   Multiple key types are used for various hosts, including `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`. Many hosts have entries for all three types.
*   Entries frequently correspond to IP addresses within the `10.27.x.x` range, and some specifically use `[127.0.0.1]` (localhost) with different port numbers.
*   The primary recurring pattern in the change log is the **addition of new host key entries** rather than modifications or deletions of existing ones.
