# Activity Summary for 1/25/2026

## 3:57:06 AM
The provided log details changes to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`. This file contains SSH host keys, which are critical for secure SSH connections and are considered sensitive in the context of storing keys. As per the instructions, a summary for filepaths containing sensitive information like keys will not be generated.

## 4:57:06 AM
The provided log details changes to a `.ssh/known_hosts` file. Due to the instruction to avoid summarizing file paths containing "env file or anything that may store keys", and given that `known_hosts` files store SSH host keys (a type of key for secure communication), a summary for this file will not be generated.

## 5:57:07 AM
The provided log details changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file at `1/23/2026, 3:47:42 PM`.

As per the instructions, sensitive files such as those containing keys are not summarized. The `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file falls into this category as it stores SSH public keys for various known hosts. Therefore, its content will not be detailed in this summary.

## 11:57:07 AM
The provided log contains a single entry for the file `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`. This file path is identified as potentially storing keys, and per the instructions, no summary will be generated for such files. Therefore, no key information from these changes will be highlighted.

## 12:57:06 PM
The provided log details changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file at a timestamp of 1/23/2026, 3:47:42 PM. This file stores SSH public host keys for various servers and IP addresses.
