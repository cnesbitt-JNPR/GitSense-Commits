## 4:57:06 AM
The provided log contains changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file. This file stores SSH host keys, which are sensitive cryptographic data. As per the instructions, no summary will be generated for file paths containing keys or similar sensitive information.

## 5:57:05 AM
The provided log contains changes to a `.ssh/known_hosts` file. Due to the instruction not to summarize file paths containing "keys" or "env file", the content of `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` will not be summarized as it stores SSH public keys, which are security-sensitive.

## 7:57:06 PM
The provided log contains changes to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` on 1/23/2026 at 3:47:42 PM. This file stores SSH host keys, which are sensitive credentials. As per the instructions, no summary will be generated for file paths containing keys.

## 8:57:06 PM
The file `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` is an SSH configuration file that stores public host keys for servers the user has connected to. Summarizing its content would involve exposing sensitive security information (public host keys and associated hostnames/IP addresses), which goes against the instruction to avoid generating summaries for files that may store keys. Therefore, no summary is provided for this file.
