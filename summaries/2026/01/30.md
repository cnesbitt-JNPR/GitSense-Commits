## 3:57:10 AM
The provided log details a single change to the user's SSH `known_hosts` file located at `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
*   **/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts**: This file was updated on January 23, 2026, at 3:47:42 PM. As this file stores sensitive SSH host key information (fingerprints for known SSH servers), a detailed summary of its content is not provided to maintain security. The update indicates that new host entries or changes to existing host key fingerprints were recorded, typically when connecting to new SSH servers or when a server's key has changed.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The sole significant change occurred on **1/23/2026, 3:47:42 PM**.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content (General Observation without detailing sensitive info):**
The content format observed within the `known_hosts` file follows the standard structure for SSH host entries, including:
*   Host identifier (e.g., `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, IP addresses like `10.27.15.13`, `127.0.0.1` potentially with port numbers).
*   Key type (e.g., `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`).
*   The actual public key string.

This pattern is consistent with how `known_hosts` files record trusted SSH host identities.
