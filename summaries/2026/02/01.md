# Activity Summary for 2/1/2026

## 3:57:06 AM
The provided log details changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file. As this file contains SSH host keys, which are sensitive security information, a detailed summary of its content will not be generated to prevent exposure of potentially confidential data.

**Key Information from Changes:**

*   **File Path:** `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`
*   **Timestamp:** The only recorded change occurred on **1/23/2026, 3:47:42 PM**.
*   **Content Pattern:** The file appears to store a list of SSH host entries. Each entry typically includes a hostname or IP address, followed by the key type (e.g., `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`), and then the actual public key string. There are multiple entries for `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net` and numerous IP addresses in the `10.27.x.x` range, as well as `127.0.0.1` (localhost) with various port numbers. Each host often has entries for multiple key algorithms.
