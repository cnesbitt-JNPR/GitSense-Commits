# Activity Summary for 2/4/2026

## 3:47:58 AM
The primary record of code changes pertains to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file, which typically stores SSH host keys for verifying the identity of remote hosts.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The `known_hosts` file was updated twice. The first recorded change occurred on `1/23/2026, 3:47:42 PM`, and the second on `2/3/2026, 1:21:14 PM`.

*   **Initial State (1/23/2026):** This update significantly populated the `known_hosts` file. It included entries for a Juniper launchpad server (`launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`) and numerous internal IP addresses within the `10.27.x.x` range. There were also entries for the local loopback address `127.0.0.1` on specific ports (`12805`, `12807`). Each host entry typically listed multiple key types.

*   **Subsequent Update (2/3/2026):** This change appears to be an additive update to the existing `known_hosts` file. It appended new host key entries specifically for the local loopback address `127.0.0.1` on an additional port (`12801`), alongside the previously recorded entries.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The two timestamps, `1/23/2026, 3:47:42 PM` and `2/3/2026, 1:21:14 PM`, indicate distinct moments when the SSH known hosts configuration was modified. The latter update, roughly 11 days after the first, shows a continuation of adding host entries, particularly for local connections.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Host Key Types:** A consistent pattern observed across all host entries is the use of multiple SSH key algorithms: `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`. This suggests a standard practice of accepting various modern and legacy key types for host authentication.
*   **IP Address Ranges:** A large number of entries are for IP addresses within the `10.27.x.x` subnet, indicating interactions with a specific internal network segment.
*   **Localhost Entries:** Several entries target `127.0.0.1` (localhost), sometimes with specific port numbers (e.g., `:12801`, `:12805`, `:12807`), implying local services or SSH tunnels are being established or verified.
