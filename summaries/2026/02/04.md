# Activity Summary for 2/4/2026

## 3:47:58 AM
The primary record of code changes pertains to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file, which typically stores SSH host keys for verifying the identity of remote hosts.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The `known_hosts` file was updated twice. The first recorded change occurred on `1/23/2026, 3:47:42 PM`, and the second on `2/3/2026, 1:21:14 PM`.

*   **Initial State (1/23/2026):** This update significantly populated the `known_hosts` file. It included entries for a Juniper launchpad server (`launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`) and numerous internal IP addresses within the `10.27.x.x` range. There were also entries for the local loopback address `127.0.0.1` on specific ports (`12805`, `12807`). Each host entry typically listed multiple key types.

*   **Subsequent Update (2/3/2026):** This change appears to be an additive update to the existing `known_hosts` file. It appended new host key entries specifically for the local loopback address `127.0.0.1` on an additional port (`12801`), alongside the previously recorded entries.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The two timestamps, `1/23/2026, 3:47:42 PM` and `2/3/2026, 1:21:14 PM`, indicate distinct moments when the SSH known hosts configuration was modified. The latter update, roughly 11 days after the first, shows a continuation of adding host entries, particularly for local connections.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Host Key Types:** A consistent pattern observed across all host entries is the use of multiple SSH key algorithms: `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`. This suggests a standard practice of accepting various modern and legacy key types for host authentication.
*   **IP Address Ranges:** A large number of entries are for IP addresses within the `10.27.x.x` subnet, indicating interactions with a specific internal network segment.
*   **Localhost Entries:** Several entries target `127.0.0.1` (localhost), sometimes with specific port numbers (e.g., `:12801`, `:12805`, `:12807`), implying local services or SSH tunnels are being established or verified.

## 4:47:55 AM
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`.

As this file is an SSH `known_hosts` file, it stores public key fingerprints of SSH servers and is considered a sensitive file that could contain identifying information about network infrastructure. Therefore, a detailed summary of its content will not be provided.

**File-specific updates and timestamps:**

*   **File Path:** `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`
    *   **Timestamp:** 1/23/2026, 3:47:42 PM
        *   The file contained a list of SSH host keys for various entries, including `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, several `10.27.x.x` IP addresses, and localhost entries with specific ports like `[127.0.0.1]:12807` and `[127.0.0.1]:12805`.
    *   **Timestamp:** 2/3/2026, 1:21:14 PM
        *   The file was updated. The primary change observed is the addition of new host key entries for `[127.0.0.1]:12801`, including `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` key types. Other existing entries remained consistent.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**

*   The content consistently consists of entries in the format: `[hostname_or_ip_address][:port] key_type public_key_base64_encoded [comment]`.
*   Multiple key types are frequently recorded for the same host, indicating support for various cryptographic algorithms. The common key types observed are `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`.
*   Hosts include a mix of fully qualified domain names (e.g., `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`), internal IP addresses (ranging primarily in the `10.27.x.x` subnet), and localhost entries (`127.0.0.1`) often paired with specific port numbers.
*   The `public_key_base64_encoded` strings are long sequences of alphanumeric characters, characteristic of SSH public keys.

## 11:47:53 AM
The file `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` was updated twice. Due to its sensitive nature as a storage location for SSH host keys, its detailed content will not be summarized.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts**:
    *   **First recorded change**: `1/23/2026, 3:47:42 PM`.
    *   **Second recorded change**: `2/3/2026, 1:21:14 PM`. This update appears to have added new host key entries for `[127.0.0.1]:12801`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   The primary activity observed is on `1/23/2026` at `3:47:42 PM` and then on `2/3/2026` at `1:21:14 PM`, indicating two distinct modifications to the `known_hosts` file within a span of about eleven days.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content (based on hosts referenced):**

*   The `known_hosts` file contains entries for several hostnames and IP addresses, primarily from the `10.27.x.x` subnet.
*   There are entries for `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`.
*   Multiple entries for the local loopback address `127.0.0.1` are present, often with different port numbers (e.g., `[127.0.0.1]:12807`, `[127.0.0.1]:12805`, `[127.0.0.1]:12801`). The entry for `[127.0.0.1]:12801` was added in the later update.
*   For each host, multiple key types are typically stored, including `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`. This suggests the system is configured to accept various modern SSH key algorithms for host authentication.
