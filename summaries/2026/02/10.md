# Activity Summary for 2/10/2026

## 3:24:11 PM
The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/IntegrityHandler/reboot_internal_test.go` underwent a minor but consistent change between 2/10/2026, 2:35:24 PM and 2/10/2026, 2:36:57 PM.

Specifically, in multiple test functions (`testSuccessfulExitCode`, `TestExitCompromised`, `TestBypassTouchFile`, and `TestRebootTypes`), the initialization of the `context.Context` variable `ctx` was modified. It changed from `ctx := context.WithoutCancel(ctx)` to `ctx := context.TODO()`.

This indicates a pattern of updating how the context is handled within these tests, shifting from explicitly creating a context that cannot be canceled (but inherits other properties from an existing `ctx`) to using a placeholder context (`context.TODO()`) that is typically used when the appropriate context isn't yet known or available. This change occurred rapidly, suggesting a quick refactor or simplification in the test setup.
