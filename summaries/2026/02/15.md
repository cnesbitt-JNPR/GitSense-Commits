The provided log details changes to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` at 2/12/2026, 4:14:36 PM. This file contains SSH host keys for various hosts, including `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, several IP addresses in the `10.27.x.x` range, and localhost addresses (`127.0.0.1`) with specific port numbers.

Due to the sensitive nature of the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file, which stores cryptographic keys (SSH host keys), a detailed summary of its content will not be provided. However, the update indicates that the file was modified on February 12, 2026, at 4:14:36 PM, and contains a collection of SSH host entries for various network devices and local services, utilizing `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` key types.

## 2:38:05 AM
The file `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` was updated at `2/12/2026, 4:14:36 PM`. This file records the public keys of SSH hosts the user has connected to, enabling verification of server authenticity.

The updates include a significant number of new or refreshed host key entries for:
*   **External Host**: `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, which includes host keys for `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` algorithms.
*   **Internal Network Hosts**: Numerous IP addresses within the `10.27.x.x` private network range. Many of these entries also provide host keys for all three common SSH algorithms (`ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`), while some appear with only one or two. This suggests extensive interaction with an internal or staging environment.

*   Entries for `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, indicating connections to a Juniper network service.
*   Entries for `127.0.0.1` (localhost) on various ports (e.g., `12807`, `12801`, `12802`, `12809`), which could indicate local SSH forwarding or tunnel activity.

## 8:38:14 PM
The key information from the changes is an update to the user's SSH `known_hosts` file, a security file that records the public keys of remote SSH servers to verify their identity.

**File-specific updates for `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`**:
The file was updated to include a comprehensive list of SSH host keys for various systems. These entries specify the host or IP address and the cryptographic algorithm used for its public key. The updated hosts include:
*   An external hostname: `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`.
*   Numerous IP addresses within the `10.27.x.x` private network range, such as `10.27.15.13`, `10.27.36.239`, `10.27.40.88`, `10.27.35.50`, `10.27.36.198`, `10.27.33.172`, `10.27.35.34`, `10.27.35.129`, `10.27.35.27`, `10.27.34.241`, `10.27.34.127`, `10.27.35.202`, `10.27.60.106`, `10.27.14.35`, `10.27.15.239`, `10.27.34.189`, `10.27.32.106`, and `10.27.15.156`. Some of these IP addresses also include a specified port (e.g., `[10.27.15.13]:12811`).
*   Several localhost entries (`127.0.0.1`) with specific high-numbered ports, including `[127.0.0.1]:12807`, `[127.0.0.1]:12801`, `[127.0.0.1]:12802`, and `[127.0.0.1]:12809`.

**Timestamp of Significant Change**:
All the listed changes occurred at 2/12/2026, 4:14:36 PM.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements**:
*   **Key Types**: There's a consistent use of three primary SSH host key algorithms: `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`. Many hosts have entries for all three, suggesting broad compatibility with different cryptographic standards. `ssh-ed25519` keys are almost universally present for each host.
*   **Network Range**: The vast majority of the IP addresses listed fall within the `10.27.x.x` private network range, indicating extensive SSH connections within a specific internal environment or network segment.
*   **Local Port Forwarding/Services**: The multiple entries for `127.0.0.1` with various ports (e.g., 12801, 12802, 12807, 12809, 12811) suggest the use of local SSH tunnels, port forwarding, or connections to local services that are accessed via SSH.
*   **Identical Keys for Different Hosts**: The `ssh-rsa` key recorded for `10.27.34.127` and `10.27.35.202` appears to be identical, which could indicate a shared host configuration, a virtualized environment, or a consistent key deployment across multiple internal IPs.
