# Activity Summary for 2/19/2026

## 12:37:56 AM
The provided log contains changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file. As this file stores SSH keys, which are sensitive credentials, its content will not be summarized according to the instructions.

## 1:37:56 AM
The provided log details changes to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` on 2/12/2026, 4:14:36 PM. This file stores SSH host keys, which are sensitive security information. As per instructions, changes to files storing keys will not be summarized.

## 2:37:59 AM
The provided log details changes to the file `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`. This file contains SSH host keys and, as per the instructions, a summary for files storing keys will not be generated.

## 3:37:59 AM
The provided log details changes to a single file, `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`, with a timestamp of 2/12/2026, 4:14:36 PM.

Given the instruction to not generate summaries for file paths containing environment variables or anything that may store keys, the content of `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` will not be summarized as it contains SSH host keys, which are sensitive security information.

## 4:37:57 AM
The provided log contains changes to the file `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`. This file stores SSH host keys, and as per the instructions, summaries for file paths containing keys or sensitive information should not be generated.

## 12:37:57 PM
The provided log details changes to `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`. This file contains SSH host keys, which are sensitive cryptographic information. As per the instructions, content for file paths that may store keys will not be summarized.

## 1:37:57 PM
The provided log details changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` file at 2/12/2026, 4:14:36 PM.

This file, which stores SSH host keys, is excluded from summarization due to its sensitive nature as per the instructions.

## 6:02:45 PM
The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`, last updated on 2/19/2026, 5:12:50 PM, defines a Go package named `heartbeat` that is responsible for monitoring the health of an SSR (Session Smart Router) system.

The core functionality revolves around a `Monitor` interface and its implementation, `monitor` struct. This monitor periodically polls a `StateMonitor` service, typically via a Unix domain socket (`/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`), to ascertain the SSR's health status.

Key aspects of the changes include:

*   **Health State Management:** The monitor defines and manages several health states for the SSR: `SSRBooting`, `SSRInService`, `SSRDegradedService`, and `SSROutOfService`. It handles transitions between these states, including initial `bootingThreshold` (100 failures allowed) and `reconnectionThreshold` (3 failures allowed) for established connections.
*   **Periodic Polling:** The `Run` method continuously polls the health endpoint at a configurable `pollInterval` (defaulting to 3 seconds). It uses a timer and `context.Context` for graceful shutdown.
*   **HTTP Communication via Unix Socket:** The `makeHeartbeatRequest` function constructs an HTTP GET request targeting a Unix domain socket, demonstrating inter-process communication. It includes a 1-second timeout for these requests.
*   **Response Handling:** The `handleHeartbeatResponse` function parses the HTTP response, checks for an `http.StatusOK` status, reads and unmarshals a JSON body containing an `SSRHealthResponse` (which can be `SSRHealthy`, `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm`, or `SSRUnknownHealth`), and translates these into the internal `api.SSRHealth` types.
*   **Error Reporting and Logging:** The monitor logs various events, including health state changes (`Infof` for in-service, `Warnf` for degraded, `Errorf` for out-of-service) and errors encountered during the health check process.
*   **Concurrency Safety:** A `sync.Mutex` (`healthMu`) is used to ensure thread-safe access to the `health` status of the monitor.
*   **Testability:** The `monitor` struct includes a `makeRequest` function field and a `newTestMonitor` constructor, allowing for easy mocking of HTTP requests during unit testing.

The pattern observed is a robust, self-recovering health monitoring system designed for critical infrastructure components, emphasizing fault tolerance, clear state definitions, and detailed logging for diagnostic purposes. The use of a Unix socket for communication suggests an expectation of co-located processes on the same system.
