# Activity Summary for 2/22/2026

## 12:02:45 AM
The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`, last updated on 2/19/2026, 5:12:50 PM, defines a `heartbeat` package responsible for monitoring the health of the SSR (Secure Service Router) system.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Core Functionality:** The `monitor.go` file establishes a `Monitor` interface and its implementation, `monitor`, which periodically polls the SSR's health status via a `StateMonitor` service.
*   **Health States:** It defines and manages various SSR health states, including `SSRBooting`, `SSRInService`, `SSRDegradedService`, and `SSROutOfService`, along with specific `SSRHealthResponse` values (Healthy, MajorOrCriticalAlarm).
*   **Polling Mechanism:** The `Run` method initializes and continuously executes a health check loop. It employs distinct failure thresholds: a `bootingThreshold` (100 failures) for initial startup and a `reconnectionThreshold` (3 failures) for ongoing operation, allowing for a grace period during system initialization.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Health checks are performed by making HTTP GET requests to `/api/v1/ssr/health` via a Unix domain socket located at `/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`, utilizing a custom `unix.NewTransportWithStaticAddress`.
*   **Response Handling:** The `handleHeartbeatResponse` function is responsible for parsing the JSON response from the `StateMonitor`, interpreting the `health` field, and mapping it to the internal `api.SSRHealth` states.
*   **Concurrency and Safety:** A `sync.Mutex` (`healthMu`) is used to ensure thread-safe access to the monitor's `health` status.
*   **Testability:** The code includes a `newTestMonitor` constructor and a mockable `makeRequest` function, indicating a strong emphasis on unit testing.
*   **Logging:** Extensive logging (`log.Infof`, `log.Warnf`, `log.Errorf`) is integrated to provide real-time updates on health status changes and errors.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **State Management with Thresholds:** The use of `consecutiveFailures` and different thresholds (`bootingThreshold`, `reconnectionThreshold`) is a recurring pattern for managing state transitions (e.g., from booting to in-service or degraded).
*   **Modular Design for HTTP Communication:** The separation of concerns into `makeHeartbeatRequest` and `handleHeartbeatResponse` for request creation and response parsing demonstrates a consistent modular approach to network communication.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** There's a consistent pattern of checking for errors at multiple stages, including HTTP request creation, execution, response body reading, and JSON unmarshaling, returning detailed error reasons.
*   **Unix Domain Socket Usage:** The reliance on Unix domain sockets (`/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`) for internal service communication is a key architectural pattern within the ChassisManager.

## 3:02:46 AM
The provided log details changes to a single Go file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`, last updated on **February 19, 2026, at 5:12:50 PM**.

This file defines a `heartbeat` package responsible for periodically monitoring the health of an SSR (Secure Router) system via a `StateMonitor`.

**Key updates and functionalities include:**

*   **Heartbeat Monitor Implementation:** Introduces a `Monitor` interface and a `monitor` struct that implements it. This monitor calls out to SSR at regular intervals to check its health.
*   **Health States:** Defines `SSRHealthResponse` constants (`SSRUnknownHealth`, `SSRHealthy`, `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm`) to represent the health status reported by SSR, which are then mapped to internal `api.SSRHealth` states like `SSRInService`, `SSRDegradedService`, `SSROutOfService`, and `SSRBooting`.
*   **Polling Mechanism:** The `Run` method establishes a polling loop with different failure thresholds: a `bootingThreshold` of 100 consecutive failures (approximately 5 minutes with a 3-second poll interval) during initial startup and a `reconnectionThreshold` of 3 failures once the system is online.
*   **Health Check Request:**
    *   Requests are made to a Unix domain socket (`/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`) at the `/api/v1/ssr/health` endpoint using HTTP GET requests with a 1-second timeout.
    *   The `makeHeartbeatRequest` function is responsible for creating and executing these requests.
*   **Response Handling:** The `handleHeartbeatResponse` function processes the HTTP response, expecting a 200 OK status. It unmarshals a JSON payload to extract the `health` status and translates it into the system's `api.SSRHealth` types, providing descriptive reasons for degraded or out-of-service states.
*   **Concurrency and Logging:** A `sync.Mutex` (`healthMu`) is used to ensure thread-safe access to the monitor's health status. Logging is integrated to report changes in health, with `Infof`, `Warnf`, and `Errorf` used for in-service, degraded, and out-of-service states, respectively.
*   **Testing Support:** A `newTestMonitor` function is provided to facilitate unit testing by allowing the injection of a custom request function.
*   **Copyright:** The file includes a copyright notice for Juniper Networks, Inc. dated 2025.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code consistently checks for errors at each step of the network request and response parsing, returning specific error messages or health statuses.
*   **State Management:** Clear delineation of health states and the use of mutexes to safely manage the monitor's current health status.
*   **Configurable Timings:** The use of `pollInterval` and distinct `bootingThreshold`/`reconnectionThreshold` values indicates an effort to make the monitoring adaptable to different operational scenarios.
*   **Inter-process Communication:** Relies on Unix domain sockets, a common pattern for local service communication, suggesting this component interacts with other local services.
*   **Context for Control:** Extensive use of `context.Context` for managing request timeouts and shutdown signals.

## 4:02:46 AM
The provided log details changes to a single Go file responsible for SSR health monitoring.

**File Path:** `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`

**Timestamp of Change:** 2/19/2026, 5:12:50 PM. This timestamp is in the future, suggesting the code might be part of a planned feature, a future release, or a placeholder date for ongoing development.

**Key Information and Updates:**

*   **Purpose:** The `heartbeat` package periodically checks the health of the SSR (Secure Service Router) system via a `StateMonitor`. It defines a `Monitor` interface and an implementation (`monitor` struct) to manage this process.
*   **Health States:** The system defines explicit health responses: `SSRUnknownHealth` (default), `SSRHealthy`, and `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm`. These map to internal `api.SSRHealth` states like `SSRBooting`, `SSRInService`, `SSRDegradedService`, and `SSROutOfService`.
*   **Monitoring Logic (`Run` function):**
    *   Initializes with a `bootingThreshold` (100 failures, roughly a 5-minute grace period with a 3-second poll interval) to allow the SSR to start up.
    *   After the initial boot, it transitions to a `reconnectionThreshold` (3 failures) for ongoing monitoring.
    *   Periodically calls `fetchSSRHealth` to make a heartbeat request.
    *   Manages `consecutiveFailures` to determine when health state changes should occur.
    *   Uses a `context` for graceful shutdown.
*   **Heartbeat Mechanism:**
    *   `fetchSSRHealth` initiates an HTTP GET request to `/api/v1/ssr/health` using a Unix socket located at `/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`.
    *   It uses a 1-second timeout for the HTTP request.
    *   `handleHeartbeatResponse` parses the JSON response from the `StateMonitor`. It expects a `Health` field, interpreting `SSRHealthy` as `SSRInService`, `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm` as `SSRDegradedService`, and any other status or error as `SSROutOfService`.
*   **Health State Management:**
    *   `GetHealth` and `SetHealth` methods are protected by a `sync.Mutex` (`healthMu`) to ensure thread-safe access to the monitor's current health status.
    *   `applyHealth` logs health changes: `Errorf` for `SSROutOfService`, `Warnf` for `SSRDegradedService`, and `Infof` for `SSRInService`.
*   **Testability:** The `monitor` struct includes a `makeRequest` function field, allowing for easy short-circuiting of actual HTTP requests during unit testing via the `newTestMonitor` constructor.
*   **Dependencies:** The code relies on standard Go libraries (`context`, `encoding/json`, `net/http`, `time`, `sync`) and internal `Juniper-SSN` packages for API definitions, HTTP requests, Unix socket communication, and logging.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Robust Error Handling:** Extensive error checks are present for HTTP requests (creation, execution), reading response bodies, and JSON unmarshaling.
*   **Concurrency Safety:** Use of `sync.Mutex` to protect shared state (`health`, `lastHealthReason`).
*   **Structured Logging:** Different log levels (`Infof`, `Warnf`, `Errorf`) are used based on the severity of the health status.
*   **Context-aware Operations:** `context.Context` is used throughout to manage request lifecycles and enable cancellation.
*   **State Machine Logic:** The `Run` function explicitly manages different states (booting, normal operation) with varying thresholds for health determination.

The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`, last modified at `2/19/2026, 5:12:50 PM`.

**File-Specific Updates for `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`:**

This Go file defines a `heartbeat` package responsible for monitoring the health of an SSR (Session Smart Router) component within a ChassisManager.

*   **Core Functionality:** The `monitor` package periodically checks the health of the SSR by sending HTTP GET requests to a `StateMonitor` service.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   It uses a Unix socket (`/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`) for inter-process communication with the `StateMonitor`.
    *   Requests are sent to the `/api/v1/ssr/health` endpoint.
    *   Responses are parsed from JSON, translating `SSRHealthResponse` values (e.g., `SSRHealthy`, `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm`) into internal `api.SSRHealth` states (`SSRInService`, `SSRDegradedService`, `SSROutOfService`).
*   **Health State Management:**
    *   The `monitor` struct maintains the current health (`api.SSRHealth`) and the last health reason, protected by a `sync.Mutex` for thread safety.
    *   It defines a `Run` method that continuously polls for health, incorporating logic for handling `consecutiveFailures`.
    *   Initial `bootingThreshold` (100 polls, approx. 5 minutes) provides a grace period during startup, while a `reconnectionThreshold` (3 polls) is used for ongoing operation.
    *   Health changes are logged with appropriate severity (Info, Warn, Error).
*   **Architectural Elements:**
    *   An `Monitor` interface is defined, with the `monitor` struct providing the implementation.
    *   Factory functions (`NewMonitor`, `newTestMonitor`) are provided for creating instances, with the test version allowing for mock HTTP request functions.
*   **Dependencies:** The package relies on standard Go libraries (`context`, `encoding/json`, `net/http`, `time`) and internal SSR-specific packages for API definitions, HTTP request utilities, Unix socket transport, and logging (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/...`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Periodic Polling:** The central pattern is a time-based loop (`timer.Reset(m.pollInterval)`) to periodically check system health.
*   **State Machine Logic:** The system transitions between health states (Booting, InService, DegradedService, OutOfService) based on the `StateMonitor`'s response and consecutive failure counts.
*   **Inter-process Communication via Unix Socket:** A consistent approach to communicate with the `StateMonitor` through a local Unix domain socket, indicating a tightly coupled component within the same host.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code includes checks for HTTP status codes, JSON parsing errors, and network issues, mapping them to `SSROutOfService` states with descriptive reasons.
*   **Testability:** The `makeRequest` function field and `newTestMonitor` highlight a design pattern for injecting dependencies and facilitating unit testing.

The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`, last modified on 2/19/2026, 5:12:50 PM, defines a Go package named `heartbeat` responsible for monitoring the health of an SSR (Secure Service Router) system.

**File-specific updates and functionality:**
*   **Purpose:** The package `heartbeat` periodically checks the health of SSR by making requests to a `StateMonitor`.
*   **Health Monitoring Logic:** It polls an internal HTTP endpoint `/api/v1/ssr/health` via a Unix domain socket (`/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`).
*   **Health States:** Defines an internal `SSRHealthResponse` enum (`SSRUnknownHealth`, `SSRHealthy`, `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm`) which are then mapped to external `api.SSRHealth` states (`SSRBooting`, `SSRInService`, `SSRDegradedService`, `SSROutOfService`).
*   **Polling Interval:** The monitor runs on a configurable `pollInterval`, defaulting to 3 seconds for regular operation.
*   **Failure Thresholds:** It implements a failure management system with two thresholds:
    *   `bootingThreshold` (100 consecutive failures): Applies during initial startup, allowing for a longer grace period.
    *   `reconnectionThreshold` (3 consecutive failures): Applies after the system has successfully reported health once, for faster detection of subsequent issues.
*   **Concurrency:** A `sync.Mutex` (`healthMu`) is used to ensure safe concurrent access to the current health status (`health`).
*   **Logging:** Health status changes and significant events are logged using `log.Infof`, `log.Warnf`, and `log.Errorf`.
*   **Testability:** The `monitor` struct includes a `makeRequest` function field that can be short-circuited for unit testing, allowing mock HTTP responses. A `newTestMonitor` helper is provided for this purpose.
*   **Context Management:** `context.Context` is used for managing the lifecycle of the monitor's `Run` loop and applying timeouts to HTTP requests.
*   **HTTP Request Handling:** It creates HTTP GET requests with a 1-second timeout, handles response status codes, reads the response body, and unmarshals JSON to extract the health status. Robust error handling is included for network issues, non-OK responses, and JSON parsing failures.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Juniper Copyright:** All code entries begin with a Juniper Networks copyright notice for 2025.
*   **SSR Naming Convention:** The codebase consistently uses "SSR" in package names, variable names, and comments, indicating a focus on Secure Service Router technology.
*   **Internal HTTP/Unix Communication:** There's a recurring pattern of using `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/http/unix` for communication over Unix domain sockets, suggesting a common inter-process communication mechanism within the SSR ecosystem.
*   **Health Monitoring:** The concept of a `Monitor` interface and associated health states (`InService`, `DegradedService`, `OutOfService`) appears to be a standardized way of reporting system status within the SSR architecture.
*   **Context for Control:** `context.Context` is consistently used for controlling goroutine lifecycles and enforcing timeouts on operations.

*   **Multiple Key Algorithms per Host**: A consistent pattern is observed where most listed hosts (including `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`, many `10.27.x.x` IPs, and `[127.0.0.1]` entries) have associated keys for `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` types. This suggests a practice of recording multiple supported key exchange algorithms for the same host.
*   **Focus on Internal Network**: The overwhelming majority of entries are for IP addresses within the `10.27.x.x` private network, indicating extensive SSH activity within a specific internal network segment.
*   **Local Port Usage**: The presence of numerous `[127.0.0.1]` entries with varied high-numbered ports points to frequent use of local port forwarding or SSH tunneling to access services running on different local ports.

The provided log details changes to a single Go file: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`, with the timestamp 2/19/2026, 5:12:50 PM.

**File-Specific Updates (`monitor.go`):**

This file defines a `heartbeat` package responsible for periodically checking the health of an SSR (Session Smart Router) component, likely for managing LED indicators on a chassis.

*   **Core Functionality:** It implements a `Monitor` interface that continuously queries a `StateMonitor` service via a Unix domain socket (`/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`) at the `/api/v1/ssr/health` endpoint.
*   **Health States:** The monitor interprets health responses from the `StateMonitor` (e.g., `SSRHealthy`, `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm`) and maps them to internal API health states (`api.SSRInService`, `api.SSRDegradedService`, `api.SSROutOfService`).
*   **Polling Mechanism:** The `Run` method uses a timer to poll health status at a `pollInterval` (defaulting to 3 seconds). It incorporates different failure thresholds: a `bootingThreshold` (100 consecutive failures, ~5 minutes) for initial startup, and a `reconnectionThreshold` (3 consecutive failures) for ongoing operation.
*   **Concurrency and Safety:** The `monitor` struct uses a `sync.Mutex` to ensure thread-safe access to its `health` status.
*   **HTTP Communication:** It leverages `http.Client` with a custom `unix.NewTransportWithStaticAddress` to communicate over Unix domain sockets, including a 1-second timeout for health requests.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Comprehensive error handling is in place for HTTP requests, network issues, and JSON unmarshaling. It uses `log.Infof`, `log.Warnf`, and `log.Errorf` to report health changes and issues.
*   **Testability:** The `newTestMonitor` function provides a mechanism to inject a mock request function, facilitating unit testing of the heartbeat logic without actual network calls.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Health Monitoring Loop:** The fundamental pattern is a continuous loop for health checks with configurable polling intervals and failure thresholds.
*   **Thread Safety:** The use of `sync.Mutex` for shared state (`health`) is a recurring pattern to ensure safe concurrent access.
*   **Unix Domain Sockets:** All inter-process communication for health checks occurs over Unix domain sockets, indicating local service interaction.
*   **Structured Logging:** Consistent use of `log.Infof`, `log.Warnf`, and `log.Errorf` throughout the code to provide detailed operational status and alert on issues.
*   **Context for Cancellation:** The `context.Context` is used to manage the lifecycle of the monitoring goroutine, allowing for graceful shutdown.
*   **Clear Health State Mapping:** The code explicitly defines and maps external health responses to internal API health states, providing a robust state management system.
