# Activity Summary for 2/22/2026

## 12:02:45 AM
The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`, last updated on 2/19/2026, 5:12:50 PM, defines a `heartbeat` package responsible for monitoring the health of the SSR (Secure Service Router) system.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Core Functionality:** The `monitor.go` file establishes a `Monitor` interface and its implementation, `monitor`, which periodically polls the SSR's health status via a `StateMonitor` service.
*   **Health States:** It defines and manages various SSR health states, including `SSRBooting`, `SSRInService`, `SSRDegradedService`, and `SSROutOfService`, along with specific `SSRHealthResponse` values (Healthy, MajorOrCriticalAlarm).
*   **Polling Mechanism:** The `Run` method initializes and continuously executes a health check loop. It employs distinct failure thresholds: a `bootingThreshold` (100 failures) for initial startup and a `reconnectionThreshold` (3 failures) for ongoing operation, allowing for a grace period during system initialization.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Health checks are performed by making HTTP GET requests to `/api/v1/ssr/health` via a Unix domain socket located at `/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`, utilizing a custom `unix.NewTransportWithStaticAddress`.
*   **Response Handling:** The `handleHeartbeatResponse` function is responsible for parsing the JSON response from the `StateMonitor`, interpreting the `health` field, and mapping it to the internal `api.SSRHealth` states.
*   **Concurrency and Safety:** A `sync.Mutex` (`healthMu`) is used to ensure thread-safe access to the monitor's `health` status.
*   **Testability:** The code includes a `newTestMonitor` constructor and a mockable `makeRequest` function, indicating a strong emphasis on unit testing.
*   **Logging:** Extensive logging (`log.Infof`, `log.Warnf`, `log.Errorf`) is integrated to provide real-time updates on health status changes and errors.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **State Management with Thresholds:** The use of `consecutiveFailures` and different thresholds (`bootingThreshold`, `reconnectionThreshold`) is a recurring pattern for managing state transitions (e.g., from booting to in-service or degraded).
*   **Modular Design for HTTP Communication:** The separation of concerns into `makeHeartbeatRequest` and `handleHeartbeatResponse` for request creation and response parsing demonstrates a consistent modular approach to network communication.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** There's a consistent pattern of checking for errors at multiple stages, including HTTP request creation, execution, response body reading, and JSON unmarshaling, returning detailed error reasons.
*   **Unix Domain Socket Usage:** The reliance on Unix domain sockets (`/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`) for internal service communication is a key architectural pattern within the ChassisManager.

The provided log contains changes for a single file: `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts`. This file is designed to store public keys of SSH servers the user has connected to, serving as a security measure to prevent MITM attacks. As this file stores sensitive key information, its content will not be summarized as per the instructions.

The timestamp for the last recorded change to this file is 2/12/2026, 4:14:36 PM.

The provided log details changes to a single Go file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`, last updated on **February 19, 2026, at 5:12:50 PM**.

This file defines a `heartbeat` package responsible for periodically monitoring the health of an SSR (Secure Router) system via a `StateMonitor`.

**Key updates and functionalities include:**

*   **Heartbeat Monitor Implementation:** Introduces a `Monitor` interface and a `monitor` struct that implements it. This monitor calls out to SSR at regular intervals to check its health.
*   **Health States:** Defines `SSRHealthResponse` constants (`SSRUnknownHealth`, `SSRHealthy`, `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm`) to represent the health status reported by SSR, which are then mapped to internal `api.SSRHealth` states like `SSRInService`, `SSRDegradedService`, `SSROutOfService`, and `SSRBooting`.
*   **Polling Mechanism:** The `Run` method establishes a polling loop with different failure thresholds: a `bootingThreshold` of 100 consecutive failures (approximately 5 minutes with a 3-second poll interval) during initial startup and a `reconnectionThreshold` of 3 failures once the system is online.
*   **Health Check Request:**
    *   Requests are made to a Unix domain socket (`/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`) at the `/api/v1/ssr/health` endpoint using HTTP GET requests with a 1-second timeout.
    *   The `makeHeartbeatRequest` function is responsible for creating and executing these requests.
*   **Response Handling:** The `handleHeartbeatResponse` function processes the HTTP response, expecting a 200 OK status. It unmarshals a JSON payload to extract the `health` status and translates it into the system's `api.SSRHealth` types, providing descriptive reasons for degraded or out-of-service states.
*   **Concurrency and Logging:** A `sync.Mutex` (`healthMu`) is used to ensure thread-safe access to the monitor's health status. Logging is integrated to report changes in health, with `Infof`, `Warnf`, and `Errorf` used for in-service, degraded, and out-of-service states, respectively.
*   **Testing Support:** A `newTestMonitor` function is provided to facilitate unit testing by allowing the injection of a custom request function.
*   **Copyright:** The file includes a copyright notice for Juniper Networks, Inc. dated 2025.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Robust Error Handling:** The code consistently checks for errors at each step of the network request and response parsing, returning specific error messages or health statuses.
*   **State Management:** Clear delineation of health states and the use of mutexes to safely manage the monitor's current health status.
*   **Configurable Timings:** The use of `pollInterval` and distinct `bootingThreshold`/`reconnectionThreshold` values indicates an effort to make the monitoring adaptable to different operational scenarios.
*   **Inter-process Communication:** Relies on Unix domain sockets, a common pattern for local service communication, suggesting this component interacts with other local services.
*   **Context for Control:** Extensive use of `context.Context` for managing request timeouts and shutdown signals.

The file `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` was updated on 2/12/2026 at 4:14:36 PM. This update involved adding a large number of new host key entries.

The content primarily consists of hostnames and IP addresses mapped to their corresponding SSH public keys. Key types frequently observed are `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, and `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`, with many hosts having entries for multiple algorithms.

Key patterns and recurring elements include:
*   Entries for a specific hostname: `launchpad.ssn.juniper.net`.
*   A significant number of entries for IP addresses within the `10.27.x.x` range (e.g., `10.27.15.13`, `10.27.36.239`, `10.27.35.50`, `10.27.60.106`, `10.27.14.35`), suggesting connections to an internal network.
*   Several loopback addresses (`127.0.0.1`) are present, often specified with various port numbers (e.g., `[127.0.0.1]:12801`, `[127.0.0.1]:12802`, `[127.0.0.1]:12807`, `[127.0.0.1]:12809`), indicating local service interactions.
*   The overall update indicates a broad range of new SSH connections established to internal network resources and local development/service ports.
