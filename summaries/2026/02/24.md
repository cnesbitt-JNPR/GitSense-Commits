**File-Specific Updates (`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`):**
This Go file implements a `heartbeat` package within the `ChassisManager`, designed to periodically monitor the health of the Session Smart Router (SSR) via a `StateMonitor`.

Key functionalities include:
*   **Health State Management:** It defines an `Monitor` interface and a `monitor` struct to track and manage the SSR's health, which can be `api.SSRBooting`, `api.SSRInService`, `api.SSRDegradedService`, or `api.SSROutOfService`.
*   **Polling Mechanism:** The `Run` method continuously polls the SSR's health, using an initial "booting threshold" (approximately 5 minutes with a 3-second poll interval) before switching to a "reconnection threshold" (3 consecutive failures) to determine `SSROutOfService`.
*   **HTTP Communication:** It makes HTTP `GET` requests to the `/api/v1/ssr/health` endpoint on a Unix domain socket (`/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`) to fetch the health status from the `StateMonitor`.
*   **Response Handling:** The `handleHeartbeatResponse` function parses the HTTP response, checks the status code, and extracts the health status from a JSON body, mapping it to internal `api.SSRHealth` types. It specifically looks for `SSRHealthy` and `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm` responses.
*   **Concurrency Safety:** A `sync.Mutex` is used to protect the `health` status, ensuring thread-safe access and updates.
*   **Testability:** The code includes a `newTestMonitor` function and a configurable `makeRequest` field within the `monitor` struct, explicitly designed to facilitate unit testing without requiring actual network calls.
*   **Logging:** It provides detailed logging for various health state transitions and errors encountered during the heartbeat checks, using `log.Infof`, `log.Warnf`, and `log.Errorf`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Robust Health Monitoring:** A consistent pattern of robust health monitoring is evident, including defined health states, grace periods for initialization/reconnection, and detailed error handling.
*   **Internal Service Communication:** The use of Unix domain sockets (`/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`) for communication indicates a pattern of inter-process communication within the same host.
*   **API-Driven Health Status:** The system relies on an internal API endpoint (`/api/v1/ssr/health`) to fetch status information, suggesting a standardized approach to service health reporting.
*   **Error Resiliency:** Multiple layers of error checking (HTTP status codes, response body parsing, JSON unmarshalling) are in place to ensure resilience against unexpected responses or network issues.
*   **Clear Ownership:** The copyright notice from Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025, indicates the corporate origin and context of the code.

## 3:02:48 AM
The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`, last updated on `2/19/2026, 5:12:50 PM`, introduces a Go package named `heartbeat` dedicated to periodically checking the health of an SSR (Session Smart Router) system.

This package defines a `Monitor` interface and an implementing `monitor` struct, responsible for polling the SSR's health status via a `StateMonitor` service. The core functionality is managed by the `Run` method, which continuously fetches SSR health at a default `pollInterval` of 3 seconds. It incorporates a state machine for managing `consecutiveFailures`, with a 5-minute grace period during initial booting and a shorter 3-poll failure threshold for established connections.

Key aspects of the implementation include:
*   **Health Polling Mechanism:** An HTTP GET request is made to the `/api/v1/ssr/health` endpoint on a Unix domain socket (`/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`), leveraging a custom `unix.NewTransportWithStaticAddress` for this communication. Each request has a 1-second timeout.
*   **Response Interpretation:** The `handleHeartbeatResponse` function parses the JSON response from the `StateMonitor`, expecting a `health` field. It then maps integer health values (e.g., `SSRHealthy`, `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm`) to internal `api.SSRHealth` states such as `SSRInService`, `SSRDegradedService`, or `SSROutOfService`.
*   **State Management and Logging:** The `monitor` struct maintains the current `health` status and `lastHealthReason`, providing thread-safe access via `sync.Mutex`. Changes in health status are logged with `Infof`, `Warnf`, or `Errorf` severity, providing clear indications of system state transitions.
*   **Contextual Operations:** The code extensively uses `context.Context` for managing request timeouts and gracefully shutting down the monitoring routine.
*   **Testing Utilities:** A `newTestMonitor` function is provided to facilitate unit testing by allowing the injection of a custom request function, bypassing actual HTTP calls.

Overall, the file establishes a robust, periodic health monitoring system for SSR, handling various states, error conditions, and providing clear operational feedback through logging.

## 4:02:48 AM
The provided log details a significant update to the `monitor.go` file located at `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`, with a timestamp of **2/19/2026, 5:12:50 PM**.

This file implements a `heartbeat` package designed to periodically check the health of an SSR (presumably "Juniper SSN Router" or a related system) via a `StateMonitor`.

**Key updates and functionalities introduced in this file include:**

*   **Heartbeat Monitor Implementation:** Defines a `Monitor` interface and a `monitor` struct that implements it. The `monitor` struct manages the current `SSRHealth`, `lastHealthReason`, and `pollInterval`.
*   **Health Status Definitions:** Introduces `SSRHealthResponse` enum (`SSRUnknownHealth`, `SSRHealthy`, `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm`) to represent the raw health status received from SSR. These are then mapped to `api.SSRHealth` states like `SSRInService`, `SSRDegradedService`, and `SSROutOfService`.
*   **Polling Mechanism:** The `Run` method uses a `time.Timer` to poll the SSR health at regular intervals (default 3 seconds). It includes logic for initial "booting" grace periods (5 minutes) and "reconnection" thresholds (3 failures) to determine `SSROutOfService` states.
*   **Health State Management:** `GetHealth` and `SetHealth` methods are provided for thread-safe access to the monitor's health status using a `sync.Mutex`. The `applyHealth` method updates the status and logs changes (informational, warnings, or errors) if the health or reason differs.
*   **SSR Health Fetching:**
    *   `fetchSSRHealth` orchestrates the request and response handling.
    *   `makeHeartbeatRequest` performs an HTTP GET request to `/api/v1/ssr/health` using a UNIX domain socket (`/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`). This indicates inter-process communication within the system. A 1-second timeout is applied to this request.
    *   `handleHeartbeatResponse` parses the JSON response from the StateMonitor, checks for `http.StatusOK`, and interprets the `Health` field to determine the SSR's operational status.
*   **Testing Support:** A `newTestMonitor` function is included, allowing for the injection of a custom request function, simplifying unit testing.
*   **Robustness and Logging:** The code includes extensive error handling, context cancellation (`context.Context`), and detailed logging (`log.Infof`, `log.Warnf`, `log.Errorf`) to track the monitor's state and any issues.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Juniper Networks Copyright:** Each entry begins with a copyright notice for "Juniper Networks, Inc. 2025," indicating proprietary code within a larger ecosystem.
*   **Go Standard Practices:** Consistent use of `context.Context` for operation cancellation and timeouts, `sync.Mutex` for concurrency control, and standard library packages like `net/http`, `encoding/json`, `time`, and `fmt`.
*   **Internal Package Dependencies:** Relies on internal Juniper SSN Go modules for API definitions (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/api`), HTTP utilities (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/http/requests`, `github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/http/unix`), and logging (`github.com/Juniper-SSN/ssr/go/src/log`).
*   **Focus on SSR Health:** The core objective revolves around monitoring and reporting the health status of an "SSR" system component, indicating its critical role within the ChassisManager.
*   **UNIX Domain Sockets:** The use of `/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock` for communication highlights an architecture that utilizes local inter-process communication for system health checks.

## 5:02:47 AM
The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go`, updated on `2/19/2026, 5:12:50 PM`, introduces a Go package named `heartbeat` designed to periodically monitor the health of an SSR (Juniper Networks SSR) service.

This `monitor.go` file defines a `Monitor` interface and its primary implementation, `monitor`, which continuously polls the SSR's health status. Key functionalities include:
*   **Health State Management**: It maintains the current health of the SSR, transitioning between `SSRBooting`, `SSRInService`, `SSRDegradedService`, and `SSROutOfService` states. A `sync.Mutex` ensures thread-safe access to the health status.
*   **Periodic Polling**: The `Run` method orchestrates a loop that checks health at regular `pollInterval`s (defaulting to 3 seconds), with an initial `bootingThreshold` of 100 failures (5 minutes) before establishing a more stringent `reconnectionThreshold` of 3 failures.
*   **Heartbeat Mechanism**: It makes HTTP GET requests to a `/api/v1/ssr/health` endpoint on a Unix domain socket (`/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`) to fetch health information from a `StateMonitor` service.
*   **Response Handling**: The `handleHeartbeatResponse` function parses the HTTP response, specifically a JSON body containing a `health` field, and maps `SSRHealthy` to `api.SSRInService`, `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm` to `api.SSRDegradedService`, and other values or errors to `api.SSROutOfService`.
*   **Logging**: Extensive use of `log.Infof`, `log.Warnf`, and `log.Errorf` provides detailed status updates and error messages based on health changes.
*   **Testability**: Includes a `newTestMonitor` function that allows short-circuiting the actual HTTP request function, aiding in unit testing.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:
*   **Health Monitoring Focus**: The entire file revolves around robust, continuous health monitoring and state management for a critical service.
*   **Unix Socket Communication**: There's a consistent use of Unix domain sockets for inter-process communication within the SSR ecosystem, specifically for the heartbeat requests.
*   **Context-driven Control**: `context.Context` is heavily utilized for managing request timeouts and graceful shutdown of the monitoring routine.
*   **Threshold-based State Changes**: The system uses configurable thresholds (`bootingThreshold`, `reconnectionThreshold`) to determine when an SSR is considered unhealthy or has recovered, providing grace periods during startup or reconnection.
*   **Modular Design with Error Handling**: Functions are clearly separated (e.g., `makeHeartbeatRequest`, `handleHeartbeatResponse`, `fetchSSRHealth`) with comprehensive error handling at each step, from network requests to JSON parsing.
