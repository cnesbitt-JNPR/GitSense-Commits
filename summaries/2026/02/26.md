# Activity Summary for 2/26/2026

## 12:02:45 AM
The file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/go/bin/ChassisManager/led/heartbeat/monitor.go` was updated on `2/19/2026, 5:12:50 PM`.

This Go code defines a `heartbeat` package responsible for periodically monitoring the health of an SSR (Secure Session Router).

Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **Heartbeat Monitoring:** The `monitor` struct implements a `Monitor` interface that continuously checks the SSR's health.
*   **Health States:** It defines `SSRHealthResponse` types (`SSRUnknownHealth`, `SSRHealthy`, `SSRMajorOrCriticalAlarm`) which are mapped to `api.SSRHealth` states like `SSRInService`, `SSRDegradedService`, and `SSROutOfService`.
*   **Polling Mechanism:** The `Run` method orchestrates a polling loop with a default `pollInterval` of 3 seconds. It incorporates a `bootingThreshold` (100 failures, roughly 5 minutes) for initial startup and a `reconnectionThreshold` (3 failures) for subsequent health checks.
*   **Communication:** Health checks are performed by making HTTP GET requests to `/api/v1/ssr/health` using a Unix socket located at `/var/run/128technology/stateMonitor.sock`. A 1-second timeout is applied to these requests.
*   **Response Handling:** The `handleHeartbeatResponse` function parses the JSON response from the SSR to determine its health status based on the `health` field.
*   **State Management & Concurrency:** The monitor's health status is protected by a `sync.Mutex`, ensuring safe concurrent access. `context.Context` is utilized for managing timeouts and cancellation.
*   **Logging:** Extensive logging is implemented (`log.Infof`, `log.Warnf`, `log.Errorf`) to report health transitions, degraded service, out-of-service events, and errors encountered during health checks.
*   **Testability:** A `newTestMonitor` function allows short-circuiting the actual request function, indicating a focus on unit testability.

The code demonstrates a robust pattern for service health monitoring, featuring periodic checks, error handling, state management, and clear logging.
