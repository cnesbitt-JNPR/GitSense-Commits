# Activity Summary for 2/28/2026

## 1:22:51 AM
All code changes occurred in the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp` on `2/27/2026`, within a 30-minute window (4:13:53 PM to 4:44:04 PM). The modifications consistently targeted the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method, focusing on its debug logging capabilities for `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`.

**File-Specific Updates & Significant Changes:**

*   **2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM:** The debug loop for listing registered devices was corrected to iterate over `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer` instead of a potentially erroneous class-level `deviceInterfaceContainer`, ensuring node-specific interface data is logged.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:26:46 PM:** The iteration style within the debug logging loop was changed from a C++11 range-based `for` loop to a traditional iterator-based `for` loop.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:30:01 PM:** The iterator access within the debug loop was updated to use `it->key1` and `it->key2` instead of `it->first.first` and `it->first.second`, suggesting `deviceInterfaceContainer` is a specialized map-like structure with custom key accessors.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM to 4:40:45 PM:** A new debug logging approach using a lambda function (`containerLogFunc`) with a `for_each_entry` method for `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer` was introduced and refined. This involved several iterative corrections:
    *   Initially, the lambda and its usage contained errors (undefined `cnt`, `stateData` variables, incorrect object `dualKeyTable`, and function `testForEachEntryFunc`).
    *   These errors were progressively fixed by changing the target object to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer` and correcting variable names within the lambda from `stateData.localMac` to `object.localMac`.
    *   The type of the `object` parameter in the lambda was explicitly defined as `const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData&`.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:41:00 PM:** The explicit call to `containerLogFunc` for `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry` was correctly implemented, and the older, redundant iterator-based debug `for` loop was removed.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:44:04 PM:** The lambda's parameter type for the object was further refined to `const std::shared_ptr<state::DeviceInterfaceStateData>& object`, and the logging output was changed to print the `object` (shared pointer) directly, rather than a specific member like `object.localMac`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The changes reveal a consistent pattern of debugging and refining the mechanism for inspecting the contents of the `deviceInterfaceContainer` within the `StateMonitor` application. The developer iteratively experimented with different C++ iteration and logging constructs, moving from standard loops to lambda-based `for_each_entry`, and correcting syntax and logical references along the way. This indicates an active process of debugging or enhancing the visibility into the state data managed by the `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder`.
