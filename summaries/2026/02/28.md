# Activity Summary for 2/28/2026

## 1:22:51 AM
All code changes occurred in the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp` on `2/27/2026`, within a 30-minute window (4:13:53 PM to 4:44:04 PM). The modifications consistently targeted the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method, focusing on its debug logging capabilities for `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`.

**File-Specific Updates & Significant Changes:**

*   **2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM:** The debug loop for listing registered devices was corrected to iterate over `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer` instead of a potentially erroneous class-level `deviceInterfaceContainer`, ensuring node-specific interface data is logged.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:26:46 PM:** The iteration style within the debug logging loop was changed from a C++11 range-based `for` loop to a traditional iterator-based `for` loop.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:30:01 PM:** The iterator access within the debug loop was updated to use `it->key1` and `it->key2` instead of `it->first.first` and `it->first.second`, suggesting `deviceInterfaceContainer` is a specialized map-like structure with custom key accessors.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM to 4:40:45 PM:** A new debug logging approach using a lambda function (`containerLogFunc`) with a `for_each_entry` method for `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer` was introduced and refined. This involved several iterative corrections:
    *   Initially, the lambda and its usage contained errors (undefined `cnt`, `stateData` variables, incorrect object `dualKeyTable`, and function `testForEachEntryFunc`).
    *   These errors were progressively fixed by changing the target object to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer` and correcting variable names within the lambda from `stateData.localMac` to `object.localMac`.
    *   The type of the `object` parameter in the lambda was explicitly defined as `const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData&`.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:41:00 PM:** The explicit call to `containerLogFunc` for `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry` was correctly implemented, and the older, redundant iterator-based debug `for` loop was removed.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:44:04 PM:** The lambda's parameter type for the object was further refined to `const std::shared_ptr<state::DeviceInterfaceStateData>& object`, and the logging output was changed to print the `object` (shared pointer) directly, rather than a specific member like `object.localMac`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The changes reveal a consistent pattern of debugging and refining the mechanism for inspecting the contents of the `deviceInterfaceContainer` within the `StateMonitor` application. The developer iteratively experimented with different C++ iteration and logging constructs, moving from standard loops to lambda-based `for_each_entry`, and correcting syntax and logical references along the way. This indicates an active process of debugging or enhancing the visibility into the state data managed by the `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder`.

## 2:22:53 AM
The provided log details a series of incremental changes within a single file: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`. All modifications occurred on `2/27/2026`, spanning a period from 4:13:53 PM to 4:44:04 PM.

**File-specific Updates:**

The changes are exclusively focused on the `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp` file, particularly within the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method. The goal of these modifications appears to be refining a debug logging statement that iterates through `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`.

Here's a breakdown of the key changes over time:

*   **2/27/2026, 4:14:07 PM:** A minor formatting change, removing a blank line.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM:** Corrected a debug logging `for` loop. Initially, it iterated over a potentially undeclared `deviceInterfaceContainer`. This was fixed to correctly iterate over `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:26:46 PM:** The debug logging `for` loop was refactored from a range-based loop to an iterator-based loop (`for (auto it = ...)`).
*   **2/27/2026, 4:30:01 PM:** Within the iterator-based debug loop, the way elements were accessed changed from `it->first.first` and `it->first.second` to `it->key1` and `it->key2`. This indicates `deviceInterfaceContainer` might be a custom container type with specific key accessors.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM:** New debug logging code was introduced using a lambda function (`containerLogFunc`) and a call to `dualKeyTable.for_each_entry(testForEachEntryFunc)`. This addition initially contained errors, such as referencing undefined variables (`cnt`, `dualKeyTable`, `testForEachEntryFunc`, `stateData.localMac`). The old `for` loop was still present.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:37:40 PM:** Addressed some errors in the newly introduced lambda logging: the iteration was corrected to use `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry(...)`, and the `[&cnt]` capture was removed from the lambda. However, `stateData.localMac` inside the lambda remained problematic.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:38:38 PM:** A minor comment `/*DEBUG*/` was added.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:39:34 PM:** The type of the `object` parameter in the `containerLogFunc` lambda was explicitly qualified with `state::`. The `stateData.localMac` issue persisted.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:40:45 PM:** The `containerLogFunc` lambda was made functional by correcting `stateData.localMac` to `object.localMac`. Concurrently, the older, now redundant, iterator-based `for` loop was removed, signifying a full transition to the new lambda-based logging approach.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:41:00 PM:** The placeholder `testForEachEntryFunc` was correctly replaced with `containerLogFunc` in the call to `for_each_entry`, fully activating the new debug logging.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:44:04 PM:** The `object` parameter type in the `containerLogFunc` lambda was changed to `const std::shared_ptr<state::DeviceInterfaceStateData>&`, and the logging output was changed from `object.localMac` to simply `object`. This suggests a refinement in how the objects are stored or how their representation is desired for debugging purposes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Debugging:** The rapid succession of small changes, often within minutes, strongly suggests an iterative debugging and refinement process, likely to correctly implement or fix a specific logging statement.
*   **Focus on Debug Logging:** All significant functional changes are concentrated on a single debug logging block within `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface`. No other substantial business logic in the file was altered.
*   **Evolution of Iteration Style:** There's a clear progression in how the `deviceInterfaceContainer` is iterated for logging, moving from simple `for` loops to a more modern C++ lambda-based `for_each_entry` pattern.
*   **Custom Container Handling:** The changes from `it->first.first` to `it->key1` and the specific `for_each_entry` usage imply `deviceInterfaceContainer` is a custom data structure that required specific adaptation for iteration and access.

## 3:22:53 AM
The provided log details a series of iterative changes to a single file: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`. All modifications occurred on 2/27/2026, spanning from 4:13:53 PM to 4:41:00 PM, indicating an active debugging or refactoring session.

**File-specific updates for `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`:**

*   **Initial State (2/27/2026, 4:13:53 PM):** The C++ file contains the `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder` class responsible for processing requests and building responses related to device interface states. It includes methods for handling requests (`handleRequest`), processing various response scenarios (all nodes/interfaces, node-specific, interface-specific), and populating protobuf-defined device interface state structures with data from internal state objects. A debug log in `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` used a range-based for loop over `deviceInterfaceContainer`.
*   **Minor Refinement (2/27/2026, 4:14:07 PM):** No functional code changes were introduced; the file remained identical to the previous version.
*   **Scope Correction (2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM):** In the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method, the debug logging loop was corrected to iterate over `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer` instead of a globally or incorrectly scoped `deviceInterfaceContainer`, ensuring the correct data source was being logged.
*   **Iteration Style Change (2/27/2026, 4:26:46 PM):** The debug logging loop in `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` was refactored from a C++11 range-based for loop to an explicit iterator-based for loop.
*   **Key Access Adjustment (2/27/2026, 4:30:01 PM):** Within the iterator-based debug loop, the way elements were accessed from the container iterator changed from `it->first.first` and `it->first.second` to `it->key1` and `it->key2`, respectively. This suggests the `deviceInterfaceContainer` uses a custom `value_type` or iterator that exposes keys directly via `key1` and `key2` members.
*   **Lambda Introduction & Debugging Attempt (2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM):** A new `containerLogFunc` lambda was introduced for logging, along with a call to `dualKeyTable.for_each_entry(testForEachEntryFunc)`. This addition appeared incomplete and introduced undefined variables (`cnt`, `dualKeyTable`, `testForEachEntryFunc`) and was added alongside the existing explicit iterator loop.
*   **Refactoring & Cleanup (2/27/2026, 4:37:40 PM):** The old explicit iterator loop was removed. The call to `for_each_entry` was corrected to use `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`, but still incorrectly referenced `testForEachEntryFunc` and had an undefined `cnt` variable in the lambda capture.
*   **Lambda Refinement - Capture & Reference Issues (2/27/2026, 4:38:38 PM):** The `containerLogFunc` lambda's capture list was changed from `[&cnt]` to `[]`, removing the problematic reference to the undefined `cnt`. However, the lambda's body still incorrectly referred to `stateData.localMac` instead of `object.localMac`, leading to a compilation error.
*   **Lambda Refinement - Parameter Type (2/27/2026, 4:39:34 PM):** The type of the `object` parameter in `containerLogFunc` was updated to `const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData&`. The `stateData.localMac` reference issue within the lambda persisted.
*   **Lambda Refinement - Body Correction (2/27/2026, 4:40:45 PM):** The lambda's body was finally corrected to use `object.localMac`, resolving the internal compilation error. The call to `for_each_entry` still mistakenly referenced `testForEachEntryFunc`.
*   **Final Debug Logging Integration (2/27/2026, 4:41:00 PM):** The `for_each_entry` call was updated to correctly use the `containerLogFunc` lambda, completing the refactoring of the debug logging mechanism in `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes consistently target the debug logging section within the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method. There's a clear pattern of evolving the logging mechanism, transitioning from a basic loop to a more structured, lambda-based `for_each_entry` pattern, involving multiple small, iterative fixes to address scope, iteration style, data access, and lambda syntax/semantics. The sequence of changes reflects a methodical, step-by-step debugging or refactoring process.

## 4:22:52 AM
The provided log details a series of iterative changes to a single file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`, all occurring on **February 27, 2026**, between 4:13 PM and 4:44 PM. These rapid updates suggest an active debugging or refinement session.

The core of the modifications is consistently focused on the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method, specifically within a debug logging section designed to list registered devices.

Here's a breakdown of the key file-specific updates:

*   **2/27/2026, 4:13:53 PM & 4:14:07 PM:** The initial state of the debug logging loop within `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` incorrectly iterated over a class member `deviceInterfaceContainer` instead of the `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer` associated with the specific node.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM:** The first significant fix corrected the container being iterated over in the debug log. The loop was updated from `for (const auto& entry : deviceInterfaceContainer)` to `for (const auto& entry : pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer)`, ensuring the correct state data was accessed.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:26:46 PM:** The loop syntax was changed from a range-based for loop to an iterator-based for loop, without altering the logical operation.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:30:01 PM:** Inside the debug loop, the way elements were accessed from the iterator was changed, switching from `it->first.first` and `it->first.second` to `it->key1` and `it->key2`. This suggests a refinement in how keys are exposed or accessed from the underlying container structure (likely a custom map or similar dual-key table).

*   **2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM:** A new lambda function, `containerLogFunc`, was introduced for logging, and a call to `dualKeyTable.for_each_entry(testForEachEntryFunc);` appeared. This commit seemed incomplete or contained test artifacts, as the lambda had undefined variables (`cnt`, `stateData`) and the old iterator-based loop was still present, creating redundancy.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:37:40 PM:** The redundant iterator-based loop was removed. The call to `dualKeyTable.for_each_entry` was corrected to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry(testForEachEntryFunc);`, aligning it with the `pStateData` context. However, the lambda's internal variable usage (`stateData.localMac` instead of `object.localMac`) and an undefined `testForEachEntryFunc` persisted as issues.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:38:38 PM:** The capture list for `containerLogFunc` was refined from `[&cnt]` to `[]`, removing the unused `cnt` variable. The incorrect variable `stateData.localMac` within the lambda body remained.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:39:34 PM:** The type of the `object` parameter in `containerLogFunc` was clarified to `const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData&`. The lambda's logging issue persisted.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:40:45 PM:** The internal logging logic within `containerLogFunc` was finally fixed, correctly referencing `object.localMac`.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:41:00 PM:** No changes visible.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:44:04 PM:** The type of the `object` parameter in `containerLogFunc` was further refined to `const std::shared_ptr<state::DeviceInterfaceStateData>&`, indicating that the `for_each_entry` method was passing shared pointers. Consequently, the logging output was adjusted to `<< object`, implying `std::shared_ptr` might have an overloaded `operator<<` or the intent changed. The use of `testForEachEntryFunc` in the call `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry(testForEachEntryFunc);` still appears to be a placeholder, likely intended to be `containerLogFunc`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent File:** All changes are isolated to `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`.
*   **Localized Changes:** The modifications are highly localized to the debug logging mechanism within the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method.
*   **Debugging/Refinement Cycle:** The timestamps and nature of changes (fixing incorrect container references, adjusting loop syntax, debugging lambda captures and variable usage) strongly suggest an iterative debugging or code refinement process.
*   **Custom Data Structures:** The use of `t128::DeviceName`, `state::StateData`, `state::DeviceInterfaceStateData`, and methods like `for_each_entry` and key accessors `key1`, `key2` indicates a custom framework with specific data structures, likely related to network device state management.
*   **Protobuf Integration:** The code interacts with Protocol Buffer messages (`pb::common::Code`, `pb::state::DeviceInterfaceStateResponse`), handling requests and building responses for device interface state information.
*   **Error Handling:** The `handleRequest` method includes robust error handling for protobuf parsing and invalid request types.
*   **State Management:** The class `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder` utilizes a `StateDataManager` to retrieve device interface state data based on node and device names, supporting queries for all nodes/interfaces, all interfaces on a specific node, or a specific interface on a specific node.

## 5:22:57 AM
The code changes primarily affect a single file: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`. All modifications observed are confined to the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method, specifically within the debug logging section that iterates and displays the contents of the `deviceInterfaceContainer`.

The changes reveal a progressive refinement of how this container is logged for debugging purposes, spanning several timestamps:

*   **2/27/2026, 4:13:53 PM & 4:14:07 PM**: The initial state of the logging within `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` uses a range-based `for` loop to iterate over `deviceInterfaceContainer`, accessing elements via `entry.first.first`, `entry.first.second`, and `entry.second`.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM**: A correction is made in the logging loop. The container being iterated is explicitly changed from `deviceInterfaceContainer` to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`, ensuring the correct object is being referenced.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:26:46 PM**: The iteration style for the debug log is updated from a range-based for loop to an explicit iterator-based `for` loop, while the logic for accessing `devicePort`, `deviceName`, and `stateData` within the loop remains functionally identical.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:30:01 PM**: The method of accessing keys within the iterator loop changes from `it->first.first` and `it->first.second` to `it->key1` and `it->key2`. This suggests that `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer` is a custom container or a specialized map-like structure whose iterators expose keys as `key1` and `key2` members, rather than nested `first.first` and `first.second`.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM**: This timestamp marks the beginning of a significant refactoring of the logging mechanism. A new lambda function, `containerLogFunc`, is introduced, along with a call to `dualKeyTable.for_each_entry(testForEachEntryFunc)`. However, this version appears incomplete and contains errors, such as undeclared variables (`cnt`, `stateData`, `dualKeyTable`, `testForEachEntryFunc`) and a duplicated, older iterator-based logging loop.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:37:40 PM**: The duplicated iterator-based for loop is removed, leaving only the newly introduced lambda and the call to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry(testForEachEntryFunc)`. The lambda still has issues with an undeclared `cnt` capture and incorrect variable `stateData.localMac` within its body.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:38:38 PM**: The `[&cnt]` capture list for `containerLogFunc` is removed, simplifying the lambda. The error of referencing `stateData.localMac` (should be `object.localMac`) within the lambda persists, as does the use of the undeclared `testForEachEntryFunc`.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:39:34 PM**: A minor type clarification is made within the lambda's parameters: the third parameter `object` is explicitly typed as `const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData&`. Other errors remain.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:40:45 PM**: The critical correction to the lambda's body is made: `stateData.localMac` is changed to `object.localMac`, resolving a compilation error. However, `testForEachEntryFunc` remains undeclared.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:41:00 PM**: The call to `for_each_entry` is finally corrected to use the `containerLogFunc` lambda, making the debug logging functional and self-contained within the lambda.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:44:04 PM**: The lambda `containerLogFunc` is further refined. The type of the `object` parameter is changed to `const std::shared_ptr<state::DeviceInterfaceStateData>&`, and the logging statement is adjusted to output the `object` shared pointer directly (likely its address or a default `operator<<` for shared pointers) instead of `object.localMac`. This indicates the container stores shared pointers to state data.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **File Specificity**: All changes are concentrated within `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`.
*   **Method Focus**: All modifications occur within the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method.
*   **Debugging Logic Evolution**: There's a clear pattern of evolving the debug logging for `deviceInterfaceContainer` from simpler loops to a more structured lambda-based approach using a custom container's `for_each_entry` method. This process involved several iterative corrections to syntax, scope, and variable access.
*   **Data Structure Adaptation**: The changes in key access (`first.first` to `key1`) and the use of `for_each_entry` with a lambda suggest that `deviceInterfaceContainer` is a custom data structure with specific iteration methods and key access patterns.
*   **Incremental Refinement**: Many timestamps show small, incremental fixes (e.g., correcting variable names, lambda captures, parameter types), indicating a step-by-step debugging or development process.

## 5:37:59 AM
A log entry for the file `/Users/cnesbitt/.ssh/known_hosts` was recorded at `2/12/2026, 4:14:36 PM`. Given that this file stores SSH public keys, its detailed content is not being summarized to comply with instructions regarding sensitive information.

## 6:23:07 AM
The following log tracks changes exclusively within the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`. This file defines a C++ class, `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder`, responsible for handling device interface state requests, processing them, and constructing protobuf responses by interacting with a `StateDataManager`. The changes primarily focus on refining and debugging the data retrieval and logging mechanisms within the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **2/27/2026, 4:13:53 PM:** The initial version of the file includes the `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder` class with methods for parsing protobuf requests, routing them based on node and device interface ID, and building a detailed device interface state response. It contains helper functions to convert internal state enums (AdminStatus, OperStatus, ProvisionalStatus, Duplex, RedundancyStatus) to protobuf common enums. A debug logging block in `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` incorrectly iterates over a global/class `deviceInterfaceContainer` instead of a `pStateData` member, and a crucial conditional check for `deviceInterfaceStateData` is commented out.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:14:07 PM:** The previously commented-out `if (deviceInterfaceStateData != nullptr)` check in `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` is uncommented, enabling the logic to populate interface data only if the state data is found. The incorrect iteration variable in the debug log persists.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM:** A significant bug fix is applied within `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface`. The debug logging loop is corrected to accurately iterate over `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`, resolving the issue where it was attempting to log from an incorrectly scoped container.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:26:46 PM:** The debug logging loop in `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` is refactored from a C++11 range-based for loop to an explicit iterator-based for loop, potentially for compatibility or more control over iteration.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:30:01 PM:** Further refinement in the debug logging loop within `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` changes how elements are accessed from the iterator, switching from `it->first.first` and `it->first.second` to `it->key1` and `it->key2`. This indicates that `deviceInterfaceContainer` likely uses a custom dual-key mapping.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM:** An attempt is made to introduce a new debug logging mechanism using a `for_each_entry` method with a lambda `containerLogFunc` in `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface`. This initial implementation is incomplete and contains several syntax and scope errors (e.g., undefined `cnt`, incorrect variable `stateData.localMac`, and references to undefined objects `dualKeyTable` and `testForEachEntryFunc`). The older iterator-based loop is still present after this new block.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:37:40 PM:** The new `for_each_entry` debug logging block is refined: `dualKeyTable.for_each_entry` is corrected to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry`, and the original iterator-based loop is removed. However, the lambda still has an undefined `cnt` in its capture list, incorrectly uses `stateData.localMac`, and the call passes `testForEachEntryFunc` instead of the defined lambda.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:38:38 PM:** The lambda's capture list in `containerLogFunc` is corrected by removing the undefined `&cnt`. The lambda still incorrectly references `stateData.localMac`, and the `for_each_entry` call still uses `testForEachEntryFunc`.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:39:34 PM:** The type of the `object` parameter in the `containerLogFunc` lambda is explicitly changed to `const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData&`. The two remaining errors from previous timestamps (incorrect lambda variable reference and incorrect function call) persist.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:40:45 PM:** The lambda within `containerLogFunc` is corrected to use `object.localMac` instead of the out-of-scope `stateData.localMac`, resolving a long-standing error. The call to `for_each_entry` still incorrectly passes `testForEachEntryFunc`.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:41:00 PM:** The final correction to the new debug logging block is made: the call to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry` is updated to correctly pass `containerLogFunc`, bringing the new logging mechanism to a functional state.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:44:04 PM:** A minor adjustment is made to the `containerLogFunc` lambda's debug output, changing it to print the entire `object` (representing `state::DeviceInterfaceStateData`) rather than just its `localMac` member, increasing logging verbosity.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM:** Major bug fix correcting the scope of the container used in a debug loop.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:30:01 PM:** Changed key access for a custom container, indicating an internal design detail of `deviceInterfaceContainer`.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM** to **4:41:00 PM:** A series of rapid, iterative changes to introduce and debug a new `for_each_entry` logging mechanism using a lambda function, fixing multiple syntax and logical errors over several commits.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Iterative Debugging:** There's a clear pattern of iterative development and debugging, particularly for the debug logging functionality in `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface`. Multiple, closely timed updates indicate a focused effort to introduce and correct a new logging approach.
*   **Protobuf Message Handling:** The core class consistently handles requests and builds responses using protobuf messages (`util::Buffer`, `message.ParseFromBuffer`, `message.SerializeToBuffer`, `message.request()`, `message.mutable_response()`).
*   **State Data Management:** The class heavily relies on `StateDataManager` to find and process state data (`stateDataManager.findNodeState`, `stateDataManager.foreachState`) and uses `state::StateData` and `state::DeviceInterfaceStateData` structures.
*   **Status Conversion Logic:** Helper methods `getAdminStatus`, `getOperStatus`, `getProvisionalStatus`, `getDuplex`, and `getRedundancyStatus` consistently convert internal state enums to common protobuf enums using switch statements.
*   **Debug Logging:** The frequent use of `DebugLog(DATA)` and `ErrorLog(DATA)` highlights a focus on monitoring and error reporting within the `StateMonitor` application. The `/*DEBUG*/` comment prefix is specifically used to mark temporary or diagnostic code, primarily related to logging.
*   **Container Access Patterns:** The way `deviceInterfaceContainer` is iterated and its elements are accessed changes throughout the log, evolving from a range-based for loop to an iterator-based loop, and then to a `for_each_entry` method with specific `key1`/`key2` access, suggesting it's a specialized container.

The provided logs detail a series of focused changes within the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp` file, all occurring on **2/27/2026** between 4:13:53 PM and 4:44:04 PM.

**File-specific updates for `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`:**

The modifications are exclusively concentrated within the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method, specifically around a debug logging block marked `/*DEBUG*/`. The evolution of this debug logging demonstrates an iterative process of refinement and correction:

*   **Initial State (4:13:53 PM):** The method included a commented-out `if` statement and a debug `for` loop that incorrectly attempted to iterate over `deviceInterfaceContainer` (presumably a member of the class) instead of `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer` (an object passed as an argument).
*   **4:14:07 PM:** The leading comment `// ` was removed from `if (deviceInterfaceStateData != nullptr)`, activating the conditional logic. The incorrect loop iteration remained.
*   **4:21:49 PM:** The debug `for` loop was corrected to iterate over `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`, resolving the scope issue.
*   **4:26:46 PM:** The corrected `for` loop was refactored from a range-based `for` loop to an iterator-based `for` loop.
*   **4:30:01 PM:** A syntax error was introduced in the iterator-based loop, attempting to access `it->key1` and `it->key2` instead of `it->first.first` and `it->first.second`.
*   **4:35:42 PM:** This timestamp marks a significant, albeit incomplete, refactoring of the debug logging. A new lambda `containerLogFunc` and a call to `dualKeyTable.for_each_entry(testForEachEntryFunc)` were introduced. This new logging mechanism contained multiple syntax errors (e.g., undeclared `cnt`, `dualKeyTable`, `testForEachEntryFunc`, and incorrect variable access within the lambda `stateData.localMac`). The previously modified iterator-based `for` loop was still present alongside this new, buggy code.
*   **4:37:40 PM:** The old iterator-based `for` loop was removed. The new lambda-based logging remained, with the call changed to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry(testForEachEntryFunc)`. However, `cnt` was still captured by the lambda, `stateData.localMac` was still incorrectly referenced, and `testForEachEntryFunc` was still an undefined symbol for the `for_each_entry` call.
*   **4:38:38 PM:** The incorrect `&cnt` capture was removed from the `containerLogFunc` lambda definition.
*   **4:39:34 PM:** The type of the `object` parameter in the `containerLogFunc` lambda was corrected to `const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData&`.
*   **4:40:45 PM:** The reference `stateData.localMac` inside `containerLogFunc` was corrected to `object.localMac`, making the lambda itself syntactically correct. However, `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry` was still incorrectly invoking `testForEachEntryFunc`.
*   **4:41:00 PM:** The call to `for_each_entry` was finally corrected to use the `containerLogFunc` lambda: `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry(containerLogFunc)`.
*   **4:44:04 PM:** The `object` parameter type in `containerLogFunc` was changed to `const std::shared_ptr<state::DeviceInterfaceStateData>&`, and the debug output within the lambda was simplified from `object.localMac` to `object`, suggesting a change in how the state data object is logged.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   **2/27/2026, 4:14:07 PM:** Activation of the `if` condition for `deviceInterfaceStateData`.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM:** Correction of the `for` loop's iteration source from a global/class member to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM:** Introduction of a new, experimental lambda-based logging approach, alongside the existing method.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:37:40 PM:** Removal of the older `for` loop, committing to the lambda-based logging, despite lingering errors.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:41:00 PM:** Final correction of the `for_each_entry` call to correctly use the defined lambda.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:44:04 PM:** Refinement of the lambda's parameter type and the debug output.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**

*   **Continuous Debugging/Refinement:** All changes within this log focus on debugging and refining a single section of code responsible for logging device interface state data for a specific interface.
*   **Iterative Development:** The multiple, closely-timed commits illustrate a rapid, iterative development or debugging process where small changes are made, tested (or at least committed), and then further refined.
*   **Transition in Logging Styles:** The changes show a progression from a direct `for` loop to an iterator-based `for` loop, and then to a more modern C++ lambda-based approach using `for_each_entry` for iterating and logging.
*   **Error Introduction and Correction:** Several changes involve introducing a syntax error (e.g., `it->key1`, `stateData.localMac`, `testForEachEntryFunc`) and then correcting it in a subsequent commit, which is typical during rapid development or refactoring.
*   **Consistent File Focus:** All entries relate to the same C++ implementation file, indicating a dedicated session working on this specific component.

## 8:22:57 AM
File Path: `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`

This file underwent a series of iterative changes, all focused on a debug logging section within the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method. The primary goal of these modifications appears to be correctly iterating and logging the contents of `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:13:53 PM**: The initial state of the debug logging section includes a range-based `for` loop iterating over a generic `deviceInterfaceContainer` (which was implicitly `this->deviceInterfaceContainer`), extracting `devicePort`, `deviceName`, and `stateData`.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:14:07 PM**: No functional code changes were observed from the previous timestamp, suggesting a minor save or whitespace adjustment.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM**: The debug loop was updated to explicitly iterate over `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`, clarifying the source of the interface data.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:26:46 PM**: The iteration style changed from a range-based `for` loop to an explicit iterator-based `for` loop, still operating on `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:30:01 PM**: Within the iterator-based loop, the key access method was changed from `it->first.first` and `it->first.second` to `it->key1` and `it->key2`. This suggests `deviceInterfaceContainer` might be a custom container with specialized key accessors. This change also introduced a partially defined lambda `containerLogFunc` and a call to an undefined `dualKeyTable.for_each_entry(testForEachEntryFunc)` as an apparent incomplete attempt to use a custom `for_each_entry` method for logging.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM**: The `containerLogFunc` lambda was further refined with explicit parameter types (`const t128::DevicePort& key1`, `const t128::DeviceName& key2`, `const DeviceInterfaceStateData& object`), but still contained an error referencing an undefined `stateData.localMac` instead of `object.localMac`. The `dualKeyTable.for_each_entry(testForEachEntryFunc)` call remained, indicating ongoing experimentation.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:37:40 PM**: The original explicit iterator-based `for` loop was removed, leaving only the newly introduced lambda and the `for_each_entry` call. The lambda's capture list still used `[&cnt]` where `cnt` was undefined, and the `stateData.localMac` error persisted, as did the reference to the undefined `testForEachEntryFunc`.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:38:38 PM**: The `containerLogFunc` lambda's capture list was corrected from `[&cnt]` to `[]` (empty capture list), resolving the `cnt` reference issue. However, `stateData.localMac` inside the lambda remained incorrect.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:39:34 PM**: The type of the `object` parameter in `containerLogFunc` was explicitly qualified as `const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData&`, but the `stateData.localMac` error inside the lambda was still present.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:40:45 PM**: The critical error in `containerLogFunc` where `stateData.localMac` was used instead of `object.localMac` was finally corrected.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:41:00 PM**: The call to `for_each_entry` was corrected to use the defined `containerLogFunc` lambda (`pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry(containerLogFunc);`), replacing the placeholder `testForEachEntryFunc`.

*   **2/27/2026, 4:44:04 PM**: A final adjustment was made to the `containerLogFunc` lambda. The type of the `object` parameter changed from `const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData&` to `const std::shared_ptr<state::DeviceInterfaceStateData>&`. Consequently, the logging statement inside the lambda changed from `object.localMac` to simply `object`, implying that the `std::shared_ptr` itself, or the `state::DeviceInterfaceStateData` it points to, is expected to be streamable for debug output.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The changes demonstrate a focused, incremental debugging and refactoring effort on a specific logging mechanism. There's a clear pattern of introducing a new logging approach (lambda and `for_each_entry`), encountering compilation or logical errors, and then sequentially fixing these errors across multiple commits, indicating a "test-and-fix" development style. The `/*DEBUG*/` comments consistently mark the area of interest. The use of `DebugLog(DATA)` throughout highlights that these changes are specifically for enhancing debugging information for device interface states.

## 10:22:54 AM
The log details a series of iterative changes to the `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp` file, all occurring on **2/27/2026** within a short timeframe (from 4:13:53 PM to 4:44:04 PM).

**File-specific updates for `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`:**

The modifications are entirely contained within the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method, specifically within a debug logging block. The overall purpose of the `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder` class, which handles device interface state requests, parses Protobuf messages, and constructs responses, remains unchanged. The changes solely focus on how device interface state data is iterated and logged for debugging purposes.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   **2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM:** A critical fix was introduced in the debug `for` loop within `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface`. It corrected the iteration from a potentially incorrect `deviceInterfaceContainer` (likely a class member) to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`, ensuring the loop correctly accessed node-specific interface data.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:30:01 PM:** The debug `for` loop was further refined to use custom key accessors (`it->key1`, `it->key2`) instead of generic `it->first.first` and `it->first.second`, indicating that `deviceInterfaceContainer` is a specialized map-like structure.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM - 4:40:45 PM:** A new approach for debug logging was progressively implemented and debugged. This involved introducing a lambda function (`containerLogFunc`) and attempting to use a `for_each_entry` method on `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`. During this period, several errors were iteratively corrected:
    *   An undeclared capture variable `cnt` was removed from the lambda.
    *   An incorrect variable reference (`stateData.localMac` instead of `object.localMac`) within the lambda's `DebugLog` statement was fixed.
    *   The type of the `object` parameter in the lambda signature was refined.
    *   The call to `for_each_entry` repeatedly used an undeclared `testForEachEntryFunc`.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:41:00 PM:** The invocation of `for_each_entry` was finally corrected to properly call the `containerLogFunc` lambda, making the new debug logging mechanism functional.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:44:04 PM:** A final minor adjustment was made to the `containerLogFunc` lambda, changing the type of the iterated `object` to `std::shared_ptr<state::DeviceInterfaceStateData>` and modifying the logging to output the `object` (shared pointer) directly rather than its `localMac` member.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**

*   **Consistent Debug Logging:** All modifications are confined to a debug logging block, denoted by `/*DEBUG*/`, indicating ongoing development or troubleshooting of data access and iteration.
*   **Container Iteration Logic:** The primary recurring element is the evolution of how a container named `deviceInterfaceContainer` (accessed via `pStateData`) is iterated for debug logging. It transitions from a range-based `for` loop to an iterator-based `for` loop, and finally to a functional `for_each_entry` method with a lambda.
*   **Refinement of Data Access:** There's a pattern of refining how elements within `deviceInterfaceContainer` are accessed, first by correcting the container itself, then by using custom key accessors, and finally by adjusting the object type within the lambda.
*   **Error Correction Cycle:** Multiple timestamps show an iterative process of identifying and fixing syntax errors or logical inconsistencies (e.g., undeclared variables, incorrect member access) within the newly introduced lambda and its usage.
*   **Protobuf and State Management:** The broader context of the file involves Protobuf message parsing and serialization, and interaction with a `StateDataManager` to retrieve and populate device interface state, but this core functionality remains stable across all logged changes.

## 2:22:51 PM
All changes occurred in the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp` between 4:13:53 PM and 4:44:04 PM on February 27, 2026. The modifications primarily involve the debug logging mechanism within the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method.

**File-Specific Updates for `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`:**

*   **Initial State (2/27/2026, 4:13:53 PM):** The `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` function included a debug `for` loop that iterated directly over `deviceInterfaceContainer` to log device interface state data.
*   **Scoped Container Correction (2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM):** The debug `for` loop in `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` was updated to correctly iterate over `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`, ensuring the log reflects the container associated with the specific `StateData` object.
*   **Iteration Style Change (2/27/2026, 4:26:46 PM):** The debug `for` loop in `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` was refactored from a range-based loop to an iterator-based loop, adjusting how `devicePort`, `deviceName`, and `stateData` were accessed (`it->first.first`, `it->first.second`, `it->second`).
*   **Custom Container Key Access (2/27/2026, 4:30:01 PM):** The iterator-based `for` loop further adapted to a custom container interface, changing key access to `it->key1` and `it->key2` for `devicePort` and `deviceName` respectively.
*   **Lambda-based Logging Attempt (2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM):** A new lambda-based logging approach using `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry()` was introduced within `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface`. This initial commit included placeholder issues like an undeclared `cnt` in the lambda capture, incorrect container reference (`dualKeyTable`), and an invalid variable reference (`stateData.localMac`) within the lambda's body, while also retaining the old iterator-based loop.
*   **Refinement of Lambda Logging (2/27/2026, 4:37:40 PM - 4:40:45 PM):**
    *   The old iterator-based `for` loop was removed.
    *   The container reference for the `for_each_entry` call was corrected to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`.
    *   The lambda capture list was fixed from `[&cnt]` to `[]`.
    *   The `object` parameter in the `containerLogFunc` lambda was explicitly typed as `const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData&`.
    *   Crucially, the erroneous `stateData.localMac` within the lambda was corrected to `object.localMac` to access the `localMac` member of the provided `object`.
*   **Shared Pointer Logging (2/27/2026, 4:44:04 PM):** The `object` parameter in the `containerLogFunc` lambda was changed to `const std::shared_ptr<state::DeviceInterfaceStateData>&`, and the logging access was adjusted to `object->localMac`. This change means the debug log for `StateData` now outputs the `std::shared_ptr` object itself rather than just its `localMac` string.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused Refactoring:** All identified changes are concentrated on a single method (`populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface`) within one file.
*   **Debugging/Logging Improvement:** The recurring theme is the evolution and refinement of a debug logging loop, specifically for iterating and displaying data from `deviceInterfaceContainer`.
*   **Iterative Development:** The timestamps reveal a rapid series of commits, indicating an iterative development or debugging process where changes were made, tested, and refined in quick succession. This suggests the developer was actively working on and debugging this particular section of the code.
*   **Container Abstraction:** The changes reflect an adaptation to how `deviceInterfaceContainer` exposes its elements (from direct iteration to custom key access, then to a `for_each_entry` mechanism), implying a custom container or a change in its interface.

## 4:22:58 PM
The provided log details a series of incremental changes to a single C++ file, `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`, over a short period on **February 27, 2026**, between 4:13:53 PM and 4:44:04 PM.

**File-Specific Updates (`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`):**
The modifications are exclusively contained within the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method, specifically targeting a debug logging loop that iterates over `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`.

*   **Initial state (4:13:53 PM):** The debug logging loop incorrectly iterated over a class member `deviceInterfaceContainer` instead of the `pStateData` parameter's member (`pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`).
*   **Correction of Scope (4:21:49 PM):** The loop was updated to correctly iterate over `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`, resolving a potential bug.
*   **Iteration Style Change (4:26:46 PM):** The debug loop's iteration style was refactored from a range-based for loop (`for (const auto& entry : container)`) to an iterator-based for loop (`for (auto it = container.begin(); it != container.end(); ++it)`).
*   **Key Access Adjustment (4:30:01 PM):** Inside the iterator-based loop, the key access was changed from `it->first.first` and `it->first.second` to `it->key1` and `it->key2`, implying an internal structure change or specific accessor usage for the `deviceInterfaceContainer`.
*   **Refactoring to Lambda and `for_each_entry` (4:35:42 PM - 4:41:00 PM):** This period saw an attempt to replace the explicit for loop with a lambda function (`containerLogFunc`) and a `for_each_entry` method call. This was an iterative process of fixing errors:
    *   **4:35:42 PM:** Introduction of a `containerLogFunc` lambda and a `dualKeyTable.for_each_entry` call (both partially incorrect/undeclared) while the old for loop was still present.
    *   **4:37:40 PM:** Removal of the redundant explicit for loop. The `for_each_entry` call was corrected to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry`, but the lambda still contained undeclared references (`cnt`, `stateData`).
    *   **4:38:38 PM:** The `[&cnt]` capture was removed from the lambda, addressing an undeclared variable error.
    *   **4:39:34 PM:** The type for the `object` parameter in the lambda was explicitly prefixed with `state::`.
    *   **4:40:45 PM:** The lambda was corrected to access `object.localMac` instead of an undeclared `stateData.localMac`.
    *   **4:41:00 PM:** The `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry` call was finally corrected to use the `containerLogFunc` lambda, completing the refactoring of the debug output mechanism.
*   **Lambda Parameter Refinement (4:44:04 PM):** The type of the `object` parameter in `containerLogFunc` was further refined from `const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData&` to `const std::shared_ptr<state::DeviceInterfaceStateData>&`, and the logging output for `StateData` was simplified to log the shared pointer directly (`object`) instead of `object.localMac`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
The log entries show a concentrated effort to refactor and debug a specific part of the code related to logging device interface state data. The pattern is one of iterative refinement: identifying a bug (wrong scope), making stylistic changes (loop type), adapting to internal data structure changes (key access), and then undergoing a multi-step refactoring process to introduce a more functional/lambda-based logging approach, correcting errors in each step. All changes are confined to improving the debug output for `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder`.

## 5:22:58 PM
The changes primarily involve the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp` between 4:13:53 PM and 4:44:04 PM on February 27, 2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`:** This file underwent a series of iterative changes, mostly within the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method, specifically concerning a debug logging block for device interface state data.
    *   **2/27/2026, 4:13:53 PM - 4:14:07 PM:** The initial version of the debug logging loop used a range-based `for` loop, potentially iterating over an incorrect `deviceInterfaceContainer` (not explicitly qualified with `pStateData`).
    *   **2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM:** The iteration target for the debug loop was corrected from `deviceInterfaceContainer` to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`, fixing a potential data access error.
    *   **2/27/2026, 4:26:46 PM:** The range-based `for` loop for debug logging was refactored into an iterator-based `for` loop.
    *   **2/27/2026, 4:30:01 PM:** The method of accessing keys within the iterator-based loop was updated from `it->first.first` and `it->first.second` to `it->key1` and `it->key2`, suggesting that `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer` is a custom container type with direct key access members.
    *   **2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM:** An attempt was made to introduce a `for_each_entry` method call with a lambda for logging, but this commit introduced compilation errors (undeclared variables `cnt`, `stateData` in lambda, `dualKeyTable`, `testForEachEntryFunc` in the call). The old iterator-based loop temporarily coexisted with this erroneous new code.
    *   **2/27/2026, 4:37:40 PM - 4:40:45 PM:** Subsequent commits refined the lambda function (`containerLogFunc`), addressing syntax errors, correcting how data members (`object.localMac`) were accessed within the lambda, and explicitly defining the `object` parameter type (`const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData&`). During this phase, the erroneous call `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry(testForEachEntryFunc);` persisted, and the logging format for `object` toggled between `object.localMac` and `object` directly. The old iterator-based loop was removed.
    *   **2/27/2026, 4:41:00 PM:** The `for_each_entry` call was corrected to use the defined `containerLogFunc` lambda, and the lambda's logging format was set to `object.localMac`.
    *   **2/27/2026, 4:44:04 PM:** The lambda's `object` parameter type was changed to `const std::shared_ptr<state::DeviceInterfaceStateData>&`, indicating that the container's `for_each_entry` passes shared pointers. The logging format was finalized to display the `object` (shared pointer) directly, implying it or its dereferenced content is streamable for debug purposes.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/27/2026, 4:21:49 PM:** Corrected the iteration target for the debug loop (critical fix).
*   **2/27/2026, 4:30:01 PM:** Adapted to a custom container's key access (`it->key1`, `it->key2`).
*   **2/27/2026, 4:35:42 PM:** Initiated a significant refactoring attempt using `for_each_entry` and lambda (though initially erroneous).
*   **2/27/2026, 4:41:00 PM:** Successfully integrated the `for_each_entry` lambda call.
*   **2/27/2026, 4:44:04 PM:** Finalized the lambda parameter type and logging format, indicating the completion of the refactoring and debugging effort for this specific block.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused Refactoring/Debugging:** All changes occurred within a short timeframe on a single day, indicating a concentrated effort to refine and debug a specific section of code.
*   **Debug Logging Enhancement:** The primary focus of all modifications was the debug logging mechanism within `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface`, evolving from a simple `for` loop to a `for_each_entry` with a lambda.
*   **Container Interaction:** The changes highlighted the use of a custom container (`pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`) that likely implements `key1`, `key2`, and `for_each_entry` methods, distinct from standard C++ STL containers.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** The log demonstrates a step-by-step process of code modification, including initial errors, subsequent corrections, and gradual refinement of syntax and logic, particularly in the lambda function definition and its usage.

## 8:22:50 PM
The changes are exclusively confined to the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`. All modifications occurred on `2/27/2026`, spanning a focused period from `4:13:53 PM` to `4:44:04 PM`.

**File-specific Updates in `DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`:**

The core of the changes revolves around refining the debug logging mechanism within the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method.

1.  **Initial Logging (4:13:53 PM):** The method started with a `for` loop iterating over a container named `deviceInterfaceContainer` to log `DevicePort`, `DeviceName`, and `StateData`. This iteration used `entry.first.first`, `entry.first.second`, and `entry.second` to access map-like key-value pairs.
2.  **Container Correction (4:21:49 PM):** The iteration was corrected to target `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`, ensuring the logging was specific to the relevant `StateData` object. The access pattern remained `entry.first.first`, `entry.first.second`, and `entry.second`.
3.  **Iterator-based Loop (4:26:46 PM):** The range-based `for` loop was replaced with an explicit iterator-based `for` loop (`for (auto it = ...; it != ...; ++it)`). Correspondingly, access changed to `it->first.first`, `it->first.second`, and `it->second`.
4.  **Custom Key Access (4:30:01 PM):** The access to keys within the iterator loop was simplified, changing from `it->first.first` and `it->first.second` to `it->key1` and `it->key2`, suggesting that `deviceInterfaceContainer` is a custom container (likely a `DualKeyTable`) that provides direct accessors for its composite keys.
5.  **Transition to Lambda and `for_each_entry` (4:35:42 PM - 4:41:00 PM):**
    *   **Introduction of Lambda (4:35:42 PM):** An attempt was made to replace the explicit `for` loop with a `for_each_entry` call and a lambda `containerLogFunc`. This initial commit was incomplete, with undefined variables (`cnt`, `dualKeyTable`, `testForEachEntryFunc`) and scope issues for `stateData` within the lambda.
    *   **Loop Removal (4:37:40 PM):** The old iterator-based `for` loop was removed, leaving only the partial `for_each_entry` implementation.
    *   **Lambda Refinements (4:38:38 PM - 4:40:45 PM):** Several iterative fixes were applied to the `containerLogFunc` lambda:
        *   The lambda capture was changed to `[]`.
        *   The parameter `object` was explicitly typed `const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData& object`.
        *   The incorrect reference to `stateData.localMac` within the lambda was corrected to `object.localMac`.
    *   **Functional Call (4:41:00 PM):** The `for_each_entry` call was finally corrected to use the `containerLogFunc` lambda (`pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer.for_each_entry(containerLogFunc);`), making the functional logging mechanism complete and syntactically correct.
6.  **Shared Pointer Logging (4:44:04 PM):** The type of the `object` parameter in `containerLogFunc` was updated from `const state::DeviceInterfaceStateData&` to `const std::shared_ptr<state::DeviceInterfaceStateData>&`. Consequently, the logging statement inside the lambda changed from `object.localMac` to simply `object`, implying that the `std::shared_ptr` itself, or an overloaded `operator<<` for it, is now responsible for logging the desired state data.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:** The log demonstrates a clear pattern of iterative development, where a specific section of code (debug logging in `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface`) is progressively refined through multiple commits within a short timeframe.
*   **Transition from Imperative to Functional Style:** The developer moved from explicit `for` loops (range-based, then iterator-based) to a more functional approach using `for_each_entry` with a lambda.
*   **Debugging/Logging Focus:** All significant changes are related to enhancing or correcting the debug logging output, suggesting an effort to improve observability or troubleshoot issues related to device interface state data.
*   **Adaptation to Custom Container:** The changes highlight the use and adaptation to a custom container type (`deviceInterfaceContainer`) that exposes elements via `key1`/`key2` and a `for_each_entry` method.
