# Activity Summary for 3/1/2026

## 12:22:50 AM
The code changes exclusively concern the file `/Users/cnesbitt/shared/ssr/src/apps/StateMonitor/DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`. All modifications occurred on **2/27/2026**, spanning a period from 4:13:53 PM to 4:44:04 PM, suggesting an intensive debugging or refinement session.

The core of the changes revolves around improving and correcting the debug logging within the `populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface` method. Initially, there were no changes between 4:13:53 PM and 4:14:07 PM.

Significant changes include:
*   **4:21:49 PM**: The debug logging loop's iteration source was corrected from a class-level `deviceInterfaceContainer` to `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`, ensuring that the log correctly reflects the device interfaces associated with the specific node being processed.
*   **4:26:46 PM**: The style of iteration for the debug log was changed from a C++11 range-based for loop (`for (const auto& entry : container)`) to a more traditional iterator-based for loop (`for (auto it = container.begin(); it != container.end(); ++it)`).
*   **4:30:01 PM**: Within the iterator-based loop, the access method for container keys was modified from `it->first.first` and `it->first.second` to `it->key1` and `it->key2`, indicating a structural change in how elements are stored or accessed in the `deviceInterfaceContainer` (or a type alias for a custom key structure).
*   **4:35:42 PM**: A new debug logging mechanism using a lambda (`containerLogFunc`) and a `for_each_entry` method was introduced. This initial introduction appeared to be incomplete, referencing an undefined `cnt` variable and a non-existent `dualKeyTable`.
*   **4:37:40 PM**: The `for_each_entry` call was corrected to operate on `pStateData->deviceInterfaceContainer`, aligning with previous fixes to target the correct state data. However, it still referenced an undefined `testForEachEntryFunc` and `stateData.localMac` within the lambda.
*   **4:38:38 PM**: The lambda `containerLogFunc` was modified to be captureless (removing `[&cnt]`).
*   **4:39:34 PM**: The type of the `object` parameter in the `containerLogFunc` lambda was explicitly qualified with its namespace, `state::DeviceInterfaceStateData`.
*   **4:40:45 PM**: A crucial fix was applied within the `containerLogFunc` lambda, correcting a typo to log `object.localMac` instead of an undefined `stateData.localMac`.
*   **4:41:00 PM**: The `for_each_entry` method was finally corrected to invoke the newly defined `containerLogFunc` instead of the placeholder `testForEachEntryFunc`.
*   **4:44:04 PM**: The `containerLogFunc` lambda's `object` parameter type was changed to `const std::shared_ptr<state::DeviceInterfaceStateData>&`, and the logging statement was simplified to output the shared pointer directly (`<< object`).

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**
*   All changes are confined to a single C++ source file (`DeviceInterfaceStateResponseBuilder.cpp`).
*   The modifications are concentrated within a specific function (`populateNodeResponseForSpecificInterface`) and specifically target its debug logging section.
*   There's a clear iterative process of refining and correcting newly introduced debug logging code, starting from its introduction to fixing scope, type, and call site issues.
*   The evolution of container iteration and data access methods (from range-based for to iterator-based, and then to a `for_each_entry` with a lambda) is a recurring theme within this narrow scope.
*   Consistent use of `DebugLog(DATA)` and `ErrorLog(DATA)` macros for logging indicates a standard logging framework.
